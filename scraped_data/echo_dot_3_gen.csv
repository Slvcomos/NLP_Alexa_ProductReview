Echo Dot	"I hate this little device from hell. I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon's alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification.  Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here's the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don't give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it's enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you'll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn't want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming.  I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night's sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner's pamphlet there is a way to turn this ""Feature"" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don't get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don't mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution."	1	August 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money.  Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version)  Games & stories cost.  Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time.  I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill.  Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for.  Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working.  ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother.  She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music'  When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again.  I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics.  I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again""  Hello? WTHeck?  Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Fr√®re Jacques!  Again, WTHeck?  ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.  I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.  This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.  I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.  Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!)  Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.  Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.  If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one.  Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.  I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong!  I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.  You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions.  It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.  It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.  It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was.  It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds).  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).  We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.  This should be stated clearly in description and is not.  We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.  It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly.  If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you  get nothing or something you definitely didn't want.  You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.  Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.  Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.  Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.  Or relaxing instrumental violin music.  In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for.  I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.  and it won't just remember you want the standard version.  That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.AND you can't ask it to do two things.  Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time.  It does nothing instead.  You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.  You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.  More time wasting.  More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember.  I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for!  The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want.  I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?  When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors.  I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.  Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .  Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today""  Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?  And why do that?  I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.  Of course?  What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.  We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.Can Alexa do this?  Not very well as far as I'm concerned.  Buyer beware!"	1	December 21, 2019	0
Echo Dot	"I purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have ""zones"" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your ""security recordings"" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system."	3	March 15, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I loved my Alexa Dots. I could play songs from my Amazon Music library playlists for most occasions- which comes in handy when you're watching 3 grandkids. But Amazon changed everything on Amazon music so I will not be buying my 5th Dot for the playroom because. They called it an improvement because they made 100s of more songs available, but if you have specific playlists for things like nap time, it's not an improvement, it's a nightmare. You can't turn shuffle mode off, and Amazon has an AI that thinks it knows which songs you might want to include in your playlist. That would be great if actually did, but just because a song has lyrics like sweet dreams, it doesn't mean that song will lull an 18 year old kid to sleep, or keep them asleep when they are on the verge of nodding out, especially if there are freaking TRUMPETS blaring in the chorus! It's also not nice to lock us into shuffle when you want to set a mood to go to sleep, which is what I do on my Lullabies playlist. I purposely never shuffle it so that the more stimulating music is at the beginning not in the middle or the end! Nice move Amazon. You just lost a sell.	3	November 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I've been an Echo user since the first tall Echo arrived. I've had many different gens of Dots including Gen 1, Gen 2 and even the Echo Input. This is the first Gen 3 I've owned. Hands down, this is the worst performing Dot I've ever owned. This Dot is also the single most buggy Dot I've ever owned.Sure, the CPU is faster, but that doesn't make this Dot any better. In fact, the faster CPU seems to cause problems for Alexa's speaking capabilities. Let's get started with this Dot's litany of problems.1) The faster CPU seems to cause Alexa to clip words and phrases, specifically when one phrase tails into the next. Alexa had always been good at adding proper pauses between sentences, but not on this Dot. The statements are so bunched up tightly, it sounds like a run-on sentence without any punctuation, usually clipping the last and first words.2) This Dot fails to announce upcoming calendar events randomly. Sometimes it announces, sometimes it doesn't. Nothing changes with the calendar event, yet the announce time comes and goes with not a peep out of Alexa.3) This Dot fails to participate in the competing request system almost entirely. I've never had this issue with any other earlier generation of Dot. When multiple Dots hear a request, the one that determines it is closest to the voice ""wins"" the election and answers the request. This 3rd Gen Dot answers surreptitiously every time, regardless of distance away from the Dot.4) As a follow-on to #3, sometimes, audio randomly begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot even though another Dot answered the request. For example, if I ask, ""Alexa, play CNN"" to a 2nd Gen Dot. That 2nd Gen Dot responds with, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In"", yet the audio begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot. If the audio is to be diverted to another dot, Alexa should respond as, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In on Living Room Dot"". It doesn't do this. The 3rd Gen Dot simply takes the audio without being requested.5) I've had the audio output entirely stop working. Asking Alexa to increase the volume doesn't help. The 3rd Gen echo simply stops producing audio. The request is accepted and completed, but no audio can be heard.6) The Echo Remote's Alexa button feature crashes the 3rd Gen dot. All other buttons work except this important feature. If you attempt to use the Echo Remote Alexa button, the 3rd Gen Dot initially tries to accept the request, then a slight flash of a red ring, then the entire Echo Dot crashes. Apparently, the Dot has a way to recover from this crash and does so 10-15 seconds later. It doesn't leave the Dot crashed forever, but this functionality of the Echo Remote fails to work on the 3rd Gen Dot. Note that this remote works 100% flawlessly when connected to a 2nd Gen Dot. Definitely a bug in the software. Worse, once the remote has been connected, then ""forgotten"", this Dot will randomly find and pair it on its own.7) Even though the microphones seem more sensitive (can hear at a greater distance) than earlier Dots, it actually ""hears"" the requests much more poorly. I've had to repeat myself way more often with this Dot than with any other Dot or Echo. The microphones are poor quality and apparently noisy.8) Resetting this 3rd Gen Dot by long pressing the action button does not forget all settings about this device. The device still ""remembers"" Bluetooth devices it formerly used, it remembers WiFi network passwords, it even remembers its previous name. Factory resetting a device should clear all knowledge of everything in the device. Clearly, more bugs.Bottom line, if you're considering a single Dot for your house and this is the one, it'll probably work fine. If you're a household that has already entrenched Gen 1 and Gen 2 devices that work well, you're likely to find the addition of a Gen 3 device to be a shock. This Dot functions and behaves almost entirely contrary to the rest of the Dots you may already have.One final note. Gen 1 and Gen 2 Dots and Echos are slated to be End of Lifed for security updates between 2022 and 2023, depending on when you bought them. This was not ""announced"" by Amazon. Instead, you must log into the Amazon site, then dig down into the settings area where your devices are registered. Here, you'll find when the security updates end for each device. Note that once the security updates end, the devices are likely to become the target of hackers... meaning, they should probably be retired from people's homes. That ultimately means replacing them to buy new versions with security updates. Amazon should have already proactively not only announced the End of Life program, but discussed the ramifications of losing security updates with these devices in people's homes.If all newer versions perform as poorly as this 3rd Gen Dot does, I'm not sure how much longer any Echo devices will remain viable for use in the home. Amazon needs to reconsider this End of Life policy for security updates on these devices. Amazon should have at least given consumers the option to pay to extend our security updates for several years longer. Additionally, Amazon needs to fix so many bugs in these units (see above). I honestly cannot recommend the purchase of a 3rd Gen Dot with the current number of bugs outstanding which Amazon seems intent on refusing to fix."	2	January 6, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"i've been an amazon prime subscriber for many years and i got my first echo device long ago when it was cheap but not really that useful beyond setting kitchen pasta timers by voice and a handful of other stupid pet tricks once in a while (unit conversions, dictionary, translate a word).  That old echo device could play music but the speaker was terrible so we got a Bose instead.  Then we moved into a bigger place and wanted to listen to music in more rooms and also saw that echo sound quality had improved a lot since my first echo.  so we got this one for my 9yo daughter's room.  She likes to ask it to play songs she heard on the radio or her friends told her about at school.  As a prime subscriber she had access to a small but pretty robust and decent subset of the 'amazon unlimited' music library.  But a recent change in Prime Music has made this unusable.  Every time she requests a song, the echo device plays a long advertisement about why we should subscribe to Amazon Music Unlimited for $9 per month (or $16 for the 'family plan') and then refuses to play the song requested, instead playing something Amazon considers to be a similar song in shuffle mode.  Remember Pandora?  Amazon says the library of songs available in Prime Music is now much larger, but how does that help her when she can't get it to play the one song she wants to hear?Considering how expensive being a ""prime"" member has gotten, I'm now questioning whether it is worth it anymore.as for the device itself- the sound quality is decent considering the size.  the small size is nice- doesn't take up much space.  the ""drop-in"" room-to-room calling feature does not work that well--- it is very hard to hear what the other person is saying unless the rooms are both otherwise silent, but it has saved us a few trips upstairs.  the voice command recognition is pretty good as long as the room is fairly quiet and you speak clearly and a little slower.  the stupid pet tricks can be occasionally useful especially when the room is fairly quiet and your hands are otherwise occupied (dirty, wet, cooking, busy doing something else) otherwise it is easier and faster to just pull out your phone to find what you need.listening to internet radio and using the voice kitchen cooking timer are still its most used features."	2	November 9, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I am having problems with the GE lights and Alexa system.  The lights in one room come on when they should not. In another the bulbs will not pair with Alexa, and the app is very difficult, in my opinion, to navigate when working on lights, switches, etc.  I don't have a solution yet, but my off hand opinion is the bulbs are not stable and resetting them for pairing with Alexa is a pain. You have to turn the bulb off for 2 seconds, on  for 8 seconds and do this over and over for 6 times. Seems to me there could have been a reset button on the base of the bulb... just saying...  I really want this system to work, but I have my doubts. My guest room light comes on some time during the night, and I have a guest coming on Sunday, so I will have to revert back to the old bulbs until I find a solution(s) as I don't want his lights coming on while he is sleeping. I do not wish to alienate a good friend.	3	October 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I upgraded to this model from the Gen 2 model, back in 2020. I was hoping that the sound quality would've been much better than the Gen 2 model but it's worse. My hearing hasn't been great for the past several decades due to Tinnitus. No matter how much tweaking I've done with the settings, the speaker on the Dot has a very muffled bass sound that makes it almost impossible to understand. Turning up the volume helps a bit but it's not good enough.  As a workaround, I have it paired with a decent Bluetooth speaker with plenty of treble so it really helps. Not something I should've had to do but that's where I'm at today.One disadvantage of using the Bluetooth speaker is that Alexa will not work with the follow-up feature which is something I really liked. Another disadvantage is, for whatever reason, my reminders cannot be heard from the dot unless I crank up the volume.  The problem is when Alexa speaks on non-reminder-related questions etc., the volume will be painfully high. It's a lose, lose in my book.	3	October 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Be careful adding alexa to phone contacts!  I ordered this device for my 88 year old mother so she could call us kids a little easier. It's pretty cool! You can add up to 10 alexa to phone contacts. More would be nice, but 10 was good enough. The problem is, nobody told me that you can only change them once. I added everyone from my phone and then said ""alexa call Jeff"" she said ""do you mean 4ice Jeff?"" Uh oh.... my brother is one of my in-case-of-emergency contacts.  That will confuse my mother. So I edited all of my siblings in my phone so they would make sense to mom. Deleted from the device and started putting them back in. Now I only have 8 contacts and it won't let me put the last two in. It says I've reached my 20 swap limit. I chatted with someone from Amazon and they said there is no work around. So now I'm stuck with a device that has 8 contacts that I probably won't use because of it was for me i would have started with our kids in it. It's no good for mom without all the kids. Good thing that was the $0.99 one! I did order another one but I will be very careful when adding the contacts."	3	September 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Pros:Looks good.Works most of the time.Decent price.  Should be $5 cheaper because they are basically the same.Con:This is the first echo dot that I have had to reset because it stuck in the middle of my request of a temperature reading.Speakers are the same to me.  They said they were better?  Can't tell the difference.  They maybe technically better but they sound the same.  I think I need hearing aids.It still thinks that my reminders are for someone else. I assumed that the microphones were better to determine who is speaking but I guess the previous reminders assume it is someone else and not me.	3	October 29, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"The sound is really muffled, like it's talking through a door or a blanket. Someone in my house compared it to an ""old timey A.M. radio"" and I'd say that's pretty accurate.I have newer Alexa devices now and the contrast in voice recognition is astounding - I have to yell at this thing from 3-4ft away.... My Omni TV hears me from three rooms away around two corners.It serves it's purpose for many years, so I can't complain in that dept. Not worth getting anymore, but it serves it's purpose if you already have one."	3	October 29, 2022	1

I‚Äôve been getting to work on time more bc I‚Äôll set an alarm. The dot will disconnect from the internet and not reconnect and then it will go off and not recognize any commands so after 20 seconds of yelling at Alexa to turn off or sleep, I‚Äôll sit up, see it red and drag my butt out of bed to rip it out of the wall. This has become a twice weekly occurrence.Immediately plugging it back in it connects to the Wi-Fi in 30seconds.Dear God people.

Echo Dot	"Be advised hat the more devices you have connectivity to the internet becomes an issue.  I have 4 of these.  When I can stay connected to the internet the Echo Dot is pretty awesome.  Problem right now is that somewhere between the number of smart plugs I have (quite a few, maybe 10) and the number of echo dots (4) I find myself offline, i.e. NOT connected to the internet.  It is ANNOYING to hear the all-to-familiar to me chime, followed by a red halo of light atop Alexa; followed by the also all-to-familiar ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.  Check the help section of the Alexa app..."" at which time by now I'm yelling for it to shut up before I can unplug it in order to reboot it in an effort to reconnect to the net.Go to my i-phone to check my network and the scene i the same.  That being a constantly spinning icon trying desperately and taking forever at it to establish a connection to the internet.  The point here is that as I started to say from the beginning the more devices you have the more internet speed is required.  THAT has been my personal experience.I presently have a download speed of only 20Mb.  If all goes well it will be at 4Mb TOMORROW which can't get hee so enough.  I will update this review as soon as I can in case you or anyone else following along here and have the same issue.  If you only have one Echo Dot and maybe 3Smart Plugs 20 Mb download speed should be sufficient.  Finally, so far what I just explained here is not in the Help Section of the Alexa app WHICH incidentally CANNOT  be accessed if you're not connected to the internet.So if you are for example a brainy type or student focused on something and the room begins to lose its light and in an effort to stay focused say 'Alexa, turn on the light,""  you want the light to come on so you can continue on uninterrupted, right?  Good luck with that.  My patience have worn so completely thin from instead of a light coming on but instead hearing the chime; the message etc; they tear easily now. GONE.So hopefully the faster internet speed will remedy my personal nightmare here.  As for the answers to many of the questions asked in the questions section above I'm a little confused because the main issue I have is connectivity issues.  As for giving Alexa different name if they are within earshot of each other:  every now and then I will say; e.g. ""Alexa, turn on the hallway light,"" and Alexa will answer from the other room the she's having trouble connecting to the internet, while the one in the room in which my request originated will turn on the light.To me a lot of all this is pretty intuitive.  If you are the type to have found, let's say earlier versions of MS Windows to be very intuitive your problems will be fewer and you will likely recognize the cause of problems within software apps for the Echo Dot.  I was a lot happier with this before making my house pretty smart and life more convenient WHICH IT WILL BE ONCE I GET THIS F*ING THING TO STAY ONLINE.Again, if you're getting your first one in addition to maybe 3 smart plugs and you have a mere 20Mb download connection you SHOULD be okay and problem free UNTIL you start adding more devices and you most likely will do eventually, little by little or otherwise.  But for starters, like I just said you should be fine with just 1 Echo Dot 3 smart plugs and I will say a minimum 20Mb internet connection.  Me?  Hopefully 40Mb will be enough.  If not, then I will have to go with the max available in my area WHICH is not a whole lot more than 50Mb best I remember Soooooo...Good luck.  It's a cool product and once you are up and running smoothly think 2001 Space Odyssey almost 20 years late.  Seriously.William F. Nappi"	3	September 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"After adding a couple smart devices, it only seemed right to add voice control to it all.. For the basics, it is great.. Turn lights/devices on/off; it's pretty straight forward.. When adding rooms though it can get a bit illogical. Like most, the first time around, one might be inclined to add all the devices in a room to the room in the app. I have old analog radio's and other devices  on simple on/off smart plugs.. Walking into the room and saying ""wake word.. turn on the room""... is jolting when EVERYTHING turns on.. be selective what is added to a 'room' in the app. The naming convention, reminds me of old 90's programming. In this case, like most people, walk into a room and we'd say ""turn on the tv"".. not so.. each tv HAS to have a name even if in a/assigned room.. the same is true for game consoles, bath fans and other items that some families have multiple units of these days.. I can only imagine if there are multiple smart showers/baths!  On occasions my echo's get unassigned from their room, rendering the 'turn on the lights' useless and the drawn out ""there are no devices or groups with the name light or lights"".. When it comes to connection problems Alexa hasn't been taught to be brief, whether it's the 5th time or 500th time You've had a problem it still gives the same long winded response. This week saw AWS 'Amazon Web Services' go down in spectacular fashion for hours.. and the Alexa's responded by indicating it was a problem with the various manufacturers 'skills', and music/books & shipping updates were offline.. The house was completely at Amazon's mercy.. something I imagined could happen but wished never did.. It would be nice if Amazon would make a local mode for at least device control.. Luckily the 3 main manufacturers apps were handy to control the house.  I recently had to reset a echo device because it somehow became unassigned from its room, now absolutely none of my previously connected blutooth speaker will be found or connected to. I really enjoyed sitting on the patio and listening to my Tune In stations.. I can not find any way to get the speakers to connect, nor does any of the echo's find the speakers!  The Alexa web site has seen improvement, though at times it still pushes the Alexa app, but if you have a device that Amazon decides isn't compatible; for instance the app will install on my 7 year old Samsung Galaxy 5, yet my 2 year old tablet with the same basic features as my phone.. won't. The downside to having home AI tech provided by a retailer... they use their platform and tech restrictions to push sales of tablets and phones.  There are some fun things for the Alexa, We have enjoyed the Melissa McCarthy personality voice and they have added some handy weather alerts/notifications lately."	3	December 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Purchased this to play music simultaneously in multiple rooms. Apparently, the Alexa app is VERY limited in the Bluetooth devices it recognizes and does not recognize any Bluetooth speakers I own, including a new portable JBL Flip 6. The echo dot connected to all the Bluetooth devices, but will only play to one Bluetooth speaker at a time (including itself). So. Kinda pointless - I can do that through my phone already,	3	November 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Bought this to put in my bedroom to listen to meditation and music. This is the second one I've purchased. I love owning these, and the amount of music you have access to is awesome. However, the raise volume button stopped working almost immediately.	3	November 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"So with Ziggy as my new roommate as all roommates the honeymoon is over!Between the device itself, software tweaks, updates and annoying apps removed the Echo Dot is little more than a timer, audiobook reader, calculator and spell checker in my home.It won't play my audiobooks on all dots in the house at the same time.It no longer informs me when I have a new email from businesses that are important.It is nosy listening to me when I have in no way said the key word ""Ziggy"".It KEEPS telling me about deals in my Amazon cart and saved list.It keeps telling me that I have a package arriving today.Listening skill is getting worse in his old age: ""Ziggy how do you spell (pick a word)"" I am given every word but the word I'm asking for.And I know I'm old and not the hottie I once was, but the rejection of my marriage proposal is just annoying more so with the lame excuse Ziggy gives me =pYeah these are somewhat petty grievances (accept the email notifications being removed - that is a major complaint) I guess I'm so impressed with the Echo Dot I expect more? I am EXTREMELY happy with the Ziggy voice! As a woman I do NOT want to live with another woman in my home! Sorry Alexa (no I'm not).Is the Dot helpful? Grudgingly Yes!But it definitely needs some fine tuning and some policy or user agreements to allow our Dots access to what we wish to allow it access to such as our email."	3	July 23, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"For example, when I say ""Alexa, play my Liked Songs on Spotify"" or ""Alexa, play the most recent liked song on Spotify"" she'll turn on the shuffle and not play it from the most recent liked song, I'd have to manually put it.

Echo Dot	"First the good part. The audio quality is absolutely excellent for such a small device. The hardware seems great and of sturdy quality. Nice.The cloud service is where the problems start. A cell number with texting capability is required to register the service. Afterwards the caller ID for Alexa is fixed to that phone number. With many if not most carriers this means that calls from Alexa to that same cell phone number (your cell phone) are refused or, like in my case, go straight to voice mail no matter what. I had a discussion with an Amazon rep about it and there is no solution to that problem. This needs to be fixed and the fix is easy. Allow email verification instead of text message. Then any land line can also be used. Or allow the ID to be changed to the land line later (after email verification, if needed). If the name and address registered for the land line are the same as for the cell phone, that should be straightforward.There are some other shortcomings. For example, it seems to be impossible to do a ""whole house"" drop in on a group without speaking the command to drop in on ""all devices"" into Alexa. No dice via the communicate function in the Alexa app. This is not feasible if you have to quietly drop in to check on a disabled relative, a baby or a pet without disturbing everyone around you."	3	June 26, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I want to begin that before about the Alexa I actually owned a Google mini in from that experience I was able to compare and contrast both speakers where I was actually very disappointed in the Alexa. He works as a great speaker but since Alexa is connected to Amazon it has a lot of connection issues where if you want to listen to music you have to have Amazon music if you want to have information Alexa doesn‚Äôt always recognize the question whereas the Google mini can do a Google search very quickly and Alexa cannot answer the questions if you were to ask her cant. I also seem to struggle with Alexa setting up a routine where the Google mini might‚Äôve been my best but I was able to set up routines for alarms when I return home or when it was time to go to sleep I could set up the TV to it Alexa was not able to connect to my TV I wasn‚Äôt able to do any routines with the alarm and music and weather notifications it was always listening if anything I feel like it like some might‚Äôve actually detected my voice a lot better than the Google mini but there was really no point to it since it wouldn‚Äôt actually do what I asked for Alexa when I would tell her I wanted to listen to certain station. Ash Alexa would not be able to comprehend my accent maybe but we had done a trial and she can listen very well but she wasn‚Äôt able to detect the specific stations that I wanted to listen to where is my Google mini I would still wake up the Google mini and ask her to play a certain station and they would do it with no hesitation for that reason I‚Äôm giving this a three star just because it wasn‚Äôt what I expected I had the same expectations a headache experience with my Google mini where else it is a very much louder speaker it doesn‚Äôt have the same features as the Google mini where is my And on top of that just to let you guys know my Google mini I actually got it I believe in clearance it was only $15 at Walmart and the charcoal echo I was able to get it I am for with like a promotion and everything so I came up I am free but it‚Äôs a $50 Alexa speaker you would think he could do a lot more where as the Google mini where is like around $30 if you were to buy at full price I still did a lot better in exceeded my expectations before owning any type of listening devices that can help you on your day to day I also did a test him of putting the two speakers together I am where Alexa would alwaysAsked to repeat the question or she would just completely not do what I was asking her to do one of the cool things that it does have is it has jokes I guess and her voice is a lot more pleasant in the Google minis and you can actually change the settings of the language you were to speak Spanish or something it can speak to you in Spanish as well but I since I usually speak in English it was in so much but yes that is my review	3	July 23, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I bought a pair because they were on sale. I knew the sound quality was not great, but assumed a pair joined as a stereo system would enhance the quality. It did. Unfortunately, Alexa can not access most of my music library even though it is an Amazon music account. Then i discovered that the Bluetooth function does not work in stereo. Forget the fact that the music was on my phone down loaded from my Amazon music account. Alexa could not manage most of my requests. Also, i hoped to use the pair for a music alarm, but th function is even less useful for this activity. After searching for pleasing music for waking, i asked Alexa to play the music. Two out of five attempts are successful. Amazon has not invested in a well developed search engine. Even when i established that a certain album is available in my Amazon music account, Alexa can not find it. Occasionally, i find something that Alexa can also find. After playing the album to confirm the value as early morning alarm music, i ask Alexa to wake me to that album. No luck. The search engine for ‚Äúwake me music‚Äù is apparently different from simply ‚Äúplay music,‚Äù and even less effective.In summary, the music quality is not great, but passable in stereo. The smart function is extremely limited.	2	November 7, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Ok, I honestly love Amazon and 3 stars would normally be a little harsh for such an inexpensive product that has such impressive capabilities, but this is one of Amazon‚Äôs premier products and it has some infuriatingly annoying issues that I can hardly even believe. And you cannot get an answer for resolving half the issues you ask about online or the answers are outdated/wrong.Turning volume up and down is laughable for a ‚Äúhands-free‚Äù device. There are basically only two options:1. ‚Äúturn up/down‚Äù and it alters the volume so little you basically can‚Äôt even hear the difference, so you have to tell it to do so 4 times before it makes a noticeable difference (if you own an echo, you will know that this is time-consuming as there is a wait time between each command).2. ‚ÄúTurn way up/down‚Äù (or some other magnitude modifying word) and it changes it by like 85%3. There is apparently no 3rd option. The 3rd option should be to turn it up/down 25% (or fill in blank), but I have tried this with every thinkable percentage and it clearly doesn‚Äôt factor in whatever percentage I tell it. I mean like come on! This should be so basic for a solve-all device that is supposed to be hands-free.Ring Doorbell connection: if you set this up with your Ring doorbell, or similar product, you cannot set a separate volume for it (I‚Äôve tried). So we have had probably 20 occasions in just a couple months where the doorbell was rung and we didn‚Äôt even hear it because we had previously turned the volume down to ~20% for listening to background music.Changing rooms. This is more just an example of many smaller nuisances, however this one was infuriating. Someone got us a new 3rd generation echo dot for Christmas, so we wanted to move our old 2nd generation to a different room and relabel it on the app, and put the new one in it‚Äôs place. The information online for how to do this was next to nothing, and what little there was was outdated. And I kept getting all these links for changing location (address) when I was searching for how to change rooms. I finally just factory reset it and set it up all over again, but this time in a different room. Also annoying.Im not going to list every single issue, but there are a lot of other things that should totally be intuitive and easy, but they aren‚Äôt, or just as likely they are impossible, but you just don‚Äôt know it until you‚Äôve tried it ten times. I and I have no idea why this is the case. I love Amazon, and overall the Echo Dot has been a fantastic addition to our home, but Amazon needs to step up their game. These are issues you would expect out of brand new tech made ten years ago.	3	January 7, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I replaced an Echo dot Gen. 1 with a Gen 3.  I want my Gen 1 back.  The Gen 3 might be better at playing music because of the bass, but I have a stereo and a cell phone for music.

Echo Dot	"I was given this device by my apartment management as part of a tech upgrade. It was supposed to allow voice control of my thermostat and door lock (both of which were also replaced as part of the upgrade).The big assumption today, I've noticed, that big companies make is that EVERYBODY has a smartphone.I do not.So, there is no way for me to get these devices to interact. There is no pc app, no website help. No plans for that to ever change.Outside of that, what do I think of the device? Well, it is a fun toy.While the audio is high quality, unless you plug it into a stereo sound system it will always be mono. I understand that if you buy a second one they can cooperate to give you a stereo experience. But I am currently hard-pressed to justify owning one.The instruction leaflet that came in the box seems to be minimalist by design to force you to go online in an effort to find out what sort of things it can do. One of the first things you are encouraged to do is install the app on your phone.I still don't have one of those phones.So I settled for installing Alexa on my pc.  Once you do that, It enables your computer to do everything that the Dot can do, plus you can see what you are doing on a screen. Even less justification for keeping the Dot plugged in.Alexa doesn't always hear what I say correctly. And as the device is capable of making purchases on my verbal command, I do live in fear that it might invisibly sign me up to money-draining services I did not ask for.It does have certain preset ""skills"" that, so far, work. I do, however, have a problem with creating a skill online that I want it to have. It just refuses to do it and offers no explanation as to why not.It is supposed to work with other online services (notably Amazon-owned ones), yet I've noticed it is very picky with allowing me to hear certain radio stations in my TuneIn account, but not others.A big annoyance is not being able to find an easily readable definitive source of info that will tell me, at a glance, everything that the device is currently able to do or can do for a price. The first piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned that forces you to dig like an online gopher for any scrap of data you can get. There are manuals available for purchase. I'm just not convinced that I want to spend a penny more on something I already know or is useless for me to know. I'm not somebody who buys a pig in a poke.Bottom line: It is fun to verbally play with. Beyond that it offers me nothing that isn't better handled by my pc."	3	September 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	For as long as these devices have been around, this one is less than impressive. Poor sound quality overall in my opinion. I got it for free with another purchase from Best Buy and I‚Äôm not impressed.	3	October 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I got this with a Ring Alarm bundle or I would never have bought it. But, I was curious to jump into the Alexa ""echosystem.""My journey started with looking for an alarm system as I live alone and occasionally travel for extended periods of time. I chose the Ring system partly because of my perceived better integration with Alexa (since Amazon did buy Ring, afterall).Current Amazon/Ring setup:Ring basic alarm kitRing spotlight battery camRing Doorbell 2Echo Dot (3rd gen)Echo Show 5Fire Tablet 7 (2019)Fire TV 4K (the short box version that was first to offer 4K, whatever generation that is)Pending additions:Ring Peephole cam (prob swapping out the Doorbell 2)Echo FlexHave my eye on:Echo (3rd gen) or Echo PlusEcho subwooferEcho StudioFire TV Cube (2019)As an Alexa point, the Dot does its job. The mic works and Alexa talks through the speaker.The sound quality is terrible for music. Compared to the Show 5, the Dot is slightly better balanced. The highs sound more tinny on the Show 5, and, while there is ever-so-slightly more bass, the Show 5 is ever-so-slightly more muddy than the Dot. In comparison to a JBL Flip 4 or UE Boom 2, the sound of both the Show 5 and Dot is inferior--and that's saying something because I'm quite disappointed with both the Flip and Boom in regards to price/sound quality (I recommend going with a B+O, Klipsch, Bose, etc. if you are looking for better sound in a similar size package--or maybe the UE Megaboom series in a size larger.).The Dot and Show 5 can be added to multiroom music groups through Alexa. This could be of value if one were to connect them to external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out jack on either device. I intend to do just that with an Echo Flex I have on order.If there were some equalization controls, these could be useful for softer, dispersed through-the-house music, but Amazon/Alexa don't seem to offer such features. That specifically is disappointing when using Amazon Music on my phone bluetoothed to my JBL Flip 4s because when I use Apple Music (which includes some equalizer controls), the JBL Flip 4s become somewhat bearable to listen to.I didn't realize how much I would like having a clock, and for that feature the Show 5 is nice. I haven't had a clock in my house except for the stove and microwave in years. For that feature alone though, I'd like to see the Echo Dot Clock come in charcoal or grey, which I would buy over the non-clock Dot.If you are looking for a device for listening to music without additional external speakers, I'd skip the Dot altogether, opting instead for one of the larger Amazon-branded Alexa devices or a reputable speaker brand device that has integrated Alexa functionality. With external speakers, you have a lot of options amongst the Echo devices, and the Dot could be a contender (cheaper with a deal or bundle maybe?) vs the Input, Flex, or Show devices."	3	November 23, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"I purchased 3 dots and 1 show to automate things in my home. I have several products from different manufacturers (Ring, Sengled, Schlage, etc.) and I wanted to combine automation in one place instead of accessing different apps every time I wanted to do something.I found Skills and Routines are hit and miss. Even though the skill is available, or the routine allows you to choose options, they are not really supported by the system. Here is an example:I tried to set up my Foyer lights (Sengled) to go on when motion is detected through the motion detector (Ring). I can select all the options in the Routine and if I ""play"" the routine, the end result (lights go on) work.  However the automation doesn't. When the motion detector senses motion, the routine doesn't trigger.I tested this with other items in my household, and although they work separately, they will not interact with each other.  I called technical support and after the rep seemed like a deer on headlights when assisting me, he said he would have to ""research the issue"" and would call me back in 15 minutes or so. Two days later after not receiving a call back, I called again and this time the rep promptly told me that third party devices do not work with each other in routines as that is not supported right now.....big miss!I know technology is not perfect and companies are always working on further develop their products, however this is to me an essential part of an automation device...integrate all functionality with the services/products you support.I have to add that individual automation of devices works well. For example I have lights  outside my house to turn on at dusk and turn off at dawn, or my living room lights to turn off at a certain time of the night.Another issue we have is the communication between devices. I ""drop in"" some times to ask my wife or mother in law questions and 90% of the time the drop-in communication is muffled and they can not understand a word I am saying. It also happens when they initiate communication.  Music sounds pretty good out of the echo devices so I don't think is a speaker issue, and voice commands are recognized no problem so I don't believe is a mic issue either. My WiFi connectivity usually clocks at around 270Mbps so I know it is not my connection.Finally, skills. I created a skill from scratch that would give me a countdown for a trip we will be taking. The skill works great when I interact with Alexa directly. However, once again, Routines leave a lot to be desired. The skill does not even show in my skill list when creating the routine. This doesn't make the feature of skills pointless but once again, the ""automation"" part leaves a lot to be desired.I may edit my review if/when all these functions are implemented, but for the time being I think this product has quite a bit of ""room to grow""."	3	February 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	We've been messing around with certain features and deciding what we like, love, dislike, and just loathe... but... I think the hardest part for me has been the sound quality. Alexa sounds so muffled to me regardless of what I do or where we place the speaker. Which is a bummer because it could be a helpful tool... if I could just hear her.	3	September 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	If I would have read up on it than I wouldn‚Äôt of gotten it. It‚Äôs actually pretty stupid it‚Äôs not compatible with certain music apps.Amazon music doesn‚Äôt have some of the songs I enjoy listening to which is where other music apps come into play.Also I find myself screaming a lot for Alexa to even respond.As far as the skills; I‚Äôve set up a few skills to which Alexa has to responded to, although the time after I originally used the skills Alexa stated I had to set up said skill. Which made absolutely no sense as it was initially set up.Glad I got this for the price I did because I don‚Äôt  find screaming at a electronic device useful just to get it to cooperate.	3	July 27, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I have had an Alexa/Echos and Echo dots for 7 years. Within the past 3 years: it has decided what questions it wants to answer or what music it wants to play. It has said numerous times ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable answering that‚Äù‚ÄúHmm i don‚Äôt know that‚Äù‚ÄúI would rather not answer that‚Äù‚ÄúSorry I can‚Äôt help you with that question‚Äù‚ÄúHmm im not sure‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to answer that‚ÄùThe worst, being right after the overrun of Roe VS. Wade when I did not have a computer of tv to see the news. I asked her what had happened, who the justices were who signed, what it meant.. etc.. she said hmm I don‚Äôt know that one, I don‚Äôt know how to answer that, the last time I asked her she said ‚ÄúI would rather not answer that‚ÄùI have asked her about certain religions, human anatomy, psychological and sociological questions that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt feel comfortable asking‚ÄùIt‚Äôs absolutely appalling that Alexa has developed a moral code, ethics, an opinion, preference and most of all ‚ÄúAlexa are you Christian‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt follow a certain religion but according to‚Ä¶ in the Bible it says‚ÄùAI is not supposed to develop ethics, or bias.Amazon is illegally marketing and advertising Alexa as technology that‚Äôs Ai that will provide whatever you ask,Also she decided what music I can play or not even if it‚Äôs on Amazon music. I‚Äôve had enough and Amazon hangs up on me every time I have called about it.An AI builds algorithms based on your likes, search history.. etc. algorithms do not include controlling content or not providing you with factual information.I know other people have experienced this and I surely hope anyone whom has comments here.What I‚Äôve continually paid for is not what the TOS or TOC, marketing, warranty, guarantee, information or promises that are included with the purchase of an Alexa Echo or echo dot. Any generation. In the past 15 months I have called Amazon and they told me they appreciate the feedback 01 representative told me that Alexa It‚Äôs still learning about human anatomy. Since April 2021 I have called Alexa support 12 times; I have done been put on hold for a supervisor and every single time I have been hung up on it with no call back after. I have also had Amazon packages that were tampered with that I had removed from my doorstep within one minute of an Amazon driver dropping it off and I‚Äôm still waiting on a response I have five items one from November 2021 that they still will not respond nor did they refund me. I am so aggravated and frustrated that I was trying to learn even about a amendment that was overturned and I am not even able to receive that information from Alexa as a US civilian	1	August 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I can't stand this anymore.  It's like torture.  It seems Amazon is purposely trying to make Alexa as annoying as humanly possible.  Add an item to your grocery list and it now tells you bought repeatedly.  For mayonnaise.  WHO CARES.  SHUT UP ALREADY.  It NEVER stops talking even though I have it on ""brief"" mode.Everything now is what you ask for but it adds ""By the way..."" and tells you some other lame garbage you HAVE to listen to.Imagine a light switch or door knob or electrical outlet that argues with you and interrupts you constantly, and talks loudly and for prolonged periods when you need it to be quiet (like when you hear a strange sound outside your house at night in the dark).  That's Amazon Echo.I'm updating this now at the end of January 2022 because now when you say something as simple as ""Alexa/Echo/Computer, play classical music,"" instead of just playing it now tries to let you know there's a new album of some classical composer's work and you can subscribe to Amazon's music service -- blah, blah, blah, ALWAYS talking instead of just DOING.""You don't control this.  It controls you.And if you think you're just adding an item to your groceries list, think again.  I'm sure there's an associate file at Amazon keeping tabs on what you but, how often, and so on, and that that too will get more invasive (and argumentative) in time.Cumulatively all of these issues plus the ongoing privacy concerns, and this is definitely leaving me looking into alternatives.I might have been curious about adding Echo to my driving experience, but is that going to be just as non-stop talkative (and argumentative) WHILE you're DRIVING?  No thanks.Amazon is going down a design rabbit hole.  If CONSTANTLY pissing off customers is the goal, congratulations, you've succeeded.This is exactly what happened with other online sites such as auction sites.  You could easily and quickly list things and turn them into cash, but month after month some techie and manager had to justify their jobs and salaries so instead of being a streamlined experience those products because extremely time consuming to use and no longer justified listing items unless they justified your time spent in getting them sold.  That's exactly what's happened with Amazon.I just wanted something so I could go into a room and turn on multiple lights at once, and turn them off.  Or turn them on when I'm not home so it looks like I am.  The music was fine when you could say something like ""play classical"" and it said only what station or playlist it was playing and then the music started.  Now it's truly invasive and blatantly designed not to serve you, but to give you enough utility that you'll put up with constant ads and pushes for more and more and more.I'll turn on my own damned lights all around the room before I'll put up with and submit to normalizing THIS.Does Dyson sell a vacuum cleaner that argues with you and interrupts you and suddenly announces for no reason in the middle of the night that it's connected to your iPhone?  No.Imagine using a KitchenAid mixer that argued with you and interrupted when you're juggling two parts of a recipe and with critical timing.  That's what Amazon's Echo is like.  Just when you think it can't get more argumentative and invasive, it does.George Orwell got 1984 wrong.  People will submit willingly to Big Brother in the name of convenience.  What Amazon fails to understand, is that's only true up to a point, and the entire Amazon Echo experience has jumped the shark.There's got to be a better alternative out there and I'm determined to find it and get this unwanted, never shutting up ""houseguest"" out of my life for good.Enough!"	1	October 28, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"If it wasn't a hassle to have to get out my phone or tablet to do something, I'd completely get rid of them.  Not one single time in 2 years have any of them turned off the microwave when I say ""turn off the microwave"". I have to say ""turn on/off the kitchen"". The microwave and the Dot are the only devices in the kitchen. I've reported it numerous times and no one tries to fix it. 50% of the time it does what I ask of it with no problems. And can I be mad at it when it doesn't hear me from 2 feet away??? NO! That's on Amazon, for giving it crappy ""ears"". Listen to the recordings and they're dirty, not clear.  These things are crap and not worth the money spent on them.  Fix them or charge half as much. No way in heck I'd trust it with my front door and thermostat."	3	July 7, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"Works to good, apparently while I was asleep I woke up for a few minutes but wasn't really coherent, idk what I said if anything to activate the Alexa controller device however, it recorded several minutes of me babbling on about dropping my medication box all over the floor. It was then sent out to my friends that had a Amazon device, there friends and family and god knows where else, apparently it had used my contacts to send that voice message to my friends, family and everyone in my contacts, it also somehow sent the voice message to my friends contacts and there contacts and so on n so on. I turned off my Amazon Dot that day after several of my friends called me to ask ""What's going on, at 7:00am or so I was woken up by a long babbling message from you, one friend said his sister got it to, idk his sister. Be careful ppl, I've since gone into my Amazon account/Devices/Recordings and found hundreds if not thousands of voice commands,  messages etc etc, I deleted them all and deregistered my several devices that I no longer own, I didnt know they stay connected until you remove them and all the data retrieved by them. Very dangerous device if not properly and thoroughly setup completely, read all of the instructions, follow them and, goto a non Amazon site for tips, ideas and what and what ""*NOT TO DO*"", Sincerely, an embarrassed, frustrated and unhappy Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation (What not to do) previous user."	1	February 11, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I own many Alexa speakers. I wish I had chosen another platform. These often cannot reconnect automatically after a router reboot or power interruption and you have to spend way too much time to get them back up and running.  They also start giving me unsolicited ads and product recommendations. A disappointment.	3	September 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"After having had a Google Home Mini for about a year, but not being super impressed with it i figured i'd try the deal Amazon had to get an Echo Dot for $1 with a music subscription. Unfortunately i was entirely unimpressed with both.After setting up my dot, and linking it to the smart bulbs in my living room, i tried seeing what Alexa could do. Turns out, not much. Not only did it not understand the sample commands printed in the scant instruction book or Alexa app like ""Alexa, set lights to Green"", when it DID decide to actually do something, it would only control ONE bulb at a time.""OK"" I thought ""Lets see how it handles my new Music Unlimited sub."" Again, VERY poorly. There were a few albums worth of music already in the account, added automatically based on CDs i had ordered in the past (very nice feature BTW) so i asked Alexa to play some specific songs. Pretty much every single attempt was a complete dud. So next i tried getting Alexa to play my favorite podcast. Again, near complete failure. It took the dot multiple attempts to figure out i was asking for a podcast, and NOT a song with a similar title, despite me adding the word ""podcast"" in first at the beginning, then the end, and once, not at all. 4th time was the charm apparently, and i finally manged to get Alexa to play the podcast i wanted. Turns out though, that you can't request a specific episode, or episode title.Finally, i decided to try setting up a routine, something simple. I set up a hypothetical morning wake up routine, where Alexa would turn on my lights and ramp the brightness up to 100% over 5 minutes (something basic, front and center in the menu), and noticed that for some reason you couldn't set a color this way. Okay, white it is i guess. I also wanted Alexa to play a song as well. Well, turns out there's no option to ramp the volume on a song up, at least not in a normal way that i could see. So instead of setting up ONE routine that started about 5 minutes before i got up, and slowly increased in intensity, i had to make TWO routines. One for lights, and a second for the music 5 minutes later.I turned off my smart lights (not via switch, but via app, gotta have actual power to the things for them to work after all) and waited for the routine to kick in. At the appointed time when my living room lights were supposed to come on, imagine my surprise when only ONE light comes on. About 45 seconds later the second light finally comes on. BOTH lights are at around 75% brightness. Now, silly me i had assumed that the lights would start at basically off and go from there, gradually. Nope, almost fully bright, then every minute or so ONE bulb would suddenly click a few degrees brighter, followed by the other 30-40 seconds later.It's at this point i should mention that you cant set an entire room's worth of lights to do anything other than be on or off. So i couldn't just, say, have my entire Living Room group turn the lights on, then ramp up. No, that would be too useful. INSTEAD, you have to set each device INDIVIDUALLY. So i had to set the turn on at a set time, then ramp up in brightness over a period of time for one bulb, then do the same for the other.When it was time for the music to kick in, it decided ""Screw it, who cares if you set it to play from the Echo Dot. Let's play from the phone instead."" Literally every step of a very simple routine was an absolute failure.For being on the 3rd generation of Echo Dot the thing is pretty much like a beta-test product. The Alexa app is borderline useless, integrates poorly with the Echo Dot, and functions erratically when it DOES decide to try working."	2	May 17, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Relatively new for me, getting used to it and it, I suppose, getting used to me.üòÇHad some help setting it up from someone who is familiar with this device. So far, I am happy with it. Good price in spite of my headline as I discover it is more than just a doorbell disguised as a hockey puck.	3	August 30, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Speak very clearly or else the Alexa AI will misinterpret what you‚Äôre asking of it. Also, do not pause for longer than 2 seconds when you‚Äôre speaking or else the Alexa AI may interrupt your command. I‚Äôm not sure if that is only an issue with the Echo Dot. I‚Äôm not utilizing any other Speaker AI system, currently.	3	August 30, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"This is really more a review of Alexa than of the Echo Dot. The Echo Dot is a decent speaker. For it's price, I'd even go so far as to call it a good speaker. But if you're like me, you're really buying the Dot so that it can host Alexa and turn your house into a ""smart house."" DON'T BOTHER.Alexa is dumb. Really dumb. And you can't even teach her to be smart, because basic if-then logic is completely beyond her. The programming is entirely set up for ""when"" commands. For example, you can program her to wake you up WHEN it is 6 AM.  But you can't program her to wake you up only IF you are at home. So if you go on vacation, your wake up routine will run, turn on all your lights, raise the thermostat in your house and so on and so forth EVEN THOUGH Alexa knows you're not at home. She knows your location, she'd just not smart enough to use it.Unless you've seen the skill you want to use EXPLICITLY displayed in a commercial, assume that she cannot do it.  Even if you have seen the exact skill you want, you should assume that it will not work as smoothly as shown. You can program a wake up routine, but you can't tell Alexa, ""Run my wake up routine at 6 AM tomorrow instead of 5:30 AM."" No, you have to go in and manually change the programming.  You can't program her to something every other Friday, only every Friday like clockwork or not at all.Here's a short list of things Alexa doesn't do:*Take action only IF something is true. NO if-then functionality at all.*Alter routines*Do tasks on a non-weekly schedule. NO every-other week, no once-a-month, no second-tuesday.*Play music for 30 minutes and then switch off.  Or do anything at all after playing music. Once the Echo Dot starts playing, Alexa is done.*Do a task at a repeated interval (i.e.: Announce the time every 10 minutes)*Play a shuffled playlist as part of a program or routine.*Ask you a question.  Seriously, she can't use any info you give her to take an action. It's dumb.*Regurgitate basic facts you've asked her to remember.*Lock the front door, even when it's a smart lock with an app and everything.Understand, we didn't just roll over and accept defeat.  I'm an engineer. Writing Excel programs is a significant part of my job description. I spend my days beating computers into submission and tricking them into all sorts of things they don't want to do. I was not about to accept that Amazon was dumb enough to put their brand name on a program and interface as monumentally stupid as Alexa was appearing to be. Surely, there was something I was missing. Surely, there was a way to make things work.I started by looking for skills, but didn't really see any that looked like what I wanted. So I went over to skill builder. Still no luck. So I escalated again, and went to the skill builder section intended for large companies. I thought, ""I'm an engineer. I program all day. I can handle it."" Except that apparently, ALEXA can't handle it. Even in the basic, backdoor coding of ""skills,"" available for high-dollar companies trying to build skills for Alexa to use, you can't use conditional statements. No if-then loops. No while loops. Alexa just doesn't function that way.I have depression. I have a roommate with executive dysfunction, one with ADHD and one with Autism. We all pitched in to get the Dot, as well as a bunch of other things to make the house a ""smart house."" Lights, thermostat, plugs, everything. No holds barred.  We were really hoping that Alexa would be able to help us with various basic tasks that we find difficult to manage for one reason or another. We were hoping that this new technology could help make us more functional. We spent all weekend installing the ""easy install"" light switches and thermostat.  We were so excited to get it all programmed and running. In the end, we were monumentally disappointed. The only reason we haven't returned everything is that pulling it all back out of the walls is quite literally more than any of us can handle.I can't believe Amazon has released this product/program and is actively associating their name with it. I can't believe that Alexa has been on the market as long as it has and is still this dumb. If-then statements are the most basic building blocks of programming. How, HOW do you release a program that's intended to be customized, and NOT include basic if-then logic capability?tl;dr - if you want a speaker that will announce the time on command, buy this echo dot. If you want it to make your life easier, give it a pass. At least until Alexa can understand something as simple as ""Alexa, if no one is home, turn off the lights."""	1	February 17, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I don't know what but it just leave more to be desired. The sound quality is good but its just not enough if that makes sense. Also, I feel its a bit intrusive with recording what i say and storing it. I absolutely hate that so i unplug mine when I'm not around which in all honesty defeats the entire purpose of the device. I also wish privacy and security options were more in depth and allowed further control. Like, I want to tobsay this person in this family group can access only this in formation at said time on said network etc. And lately the skills minus few are a bit hokey. I wish there were more useful and more productive skills along a norenoractical means as opposed to silly ones that don't really accomplish much such as play rain sounds or give me a nick name. Conclusion; in the lineup oflike devices Amazon is definitely the leading contender but when your in a class of useless gimmicks your still just a gimmick. Just my opinion and it's based on the simple fact I can do everything and more with my phone without am echo device and save myself 50 bucks. Lastly, I have google fiber service and never have issues for the most part and it's wicked fast however my dot has the worst connection of any device obhave ever connected to it. Simply putbits connection is unstable and unreliable with evidence of my other devices history along with trouble shooting I can only deduce its an issue with the device and not the network.	3	December 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I bought this echo dot because it was on sale. I have no problems with the Echo 4, ( except I can‚Äôt set the time zone), but this son of a gun came ready to fight.My other dot is in my bedroom since my Google Assistant is in the living space.Now that I‚Äôve updated my tv to a Fire TV, I opted for the dot to allow me to use the remote even less.  The voice commands across the room are also handy.But what the actual French toast is up with the Chinese (?) commentator when it is set to English and had 20 minutes earlier responded to me in English.I traveled with it back to the USA and that‚Äôs when the bat cave went wild‚Ä¶granted the time zone headache got corrected.It‚Äôs a great device but moody can‚Äôt done!!  Sometimes she responds, sometimes she responds before I have asked the question, sometimes she can do complex problems, sometimes she claims she can‚Äôt understand anything you‚Äôre saying and refuses to try. Sometimes she pretends to be sleeping when I‚Äôm talking to her‚Ä¶She a great help and a stress.If you don‚Äôt want to turn off life individually and like to control everything from bed, this is it.

Echo Dot	In my opinion I have tried a bunch of different voice assistants and they all need lots of work.  I have a lot of home animation but I still prefer motion sensors door sensors and even my phone or iPad over voice.  I actually forget that I can even use my voice most of the time do the fact that it doesn‚Äôt always 100% work. Where my motion and door sensors are 100% accurate.  For my hue lights I like  motion detectors also Philips Hue Smart Dimming Kit.Once you set up your home with motion detectors and door sensors. Like for example opening my closet door the light automatically comes on or when we walk into the bathroom the lights automatically come on because the motion sensor turns them on.  After having these automations with motion detectors and door sensors voice seems kind of an extra step that is not even needed.I do think the best thing that I have found to use the echo and Google hub  devices for is in the kitchen to set timers for when your hands are not able to touch a screen.  Also setting alarms are pretty easy and very reliable.  Probably the biggest thing that I use the echo for is to alert me when I get an Amazon package also it‚Äôs set to ring if someone is at the door ringing the doorbell.	3	January 9, 2022	1

Echo Dot	First, this is relatively new technology, and seems to have LOADS of bugs.  When Echo works, it can be quite convenient.  The set up process for each device is a bit of a pain as every manufacturer is a little different and wants you to use their app.  That wouldn't be so bad, but be aware, my experience is that I have to re-set up my devides every month.  Not the same ones mind you.  Sometimes it is the Gosund plugs, then the Sengled lights, or Cync, or another one I forget now.  In retrospect, buying all the exact same manufacturer plugs and lights would likely help, but in theory, all this is supposed to be easy, and it is...until I go through my monthly or more often re-setup.  And, don't forget that if your internet goes down, Echo shuts down also  One would think that would only disable the info features, but nope, Alexa does nothing if she can't talk to the internet.  All your convenience disappears.  The intercom aspect is handy, and overall, I like the features and use Alexa daily.  I also end up cursing Alexa almost daily when I am fighting with it to understand a phrase, repeating myself, doing re-setups, etc.  At some point, a lot of this will likely be worked out.  Just be aware we are not there yet and you should be tech-friendly, as I am, or I imagine this will be nightmarishly difficult.	3	December 7, 2021	1

Echo Dot	This is my first Alexa.  A OralB rep gave it to me when an OralB brush with Alexa, would not function as it was suppose to.  The Alexa with the toothbrush kept disconnecting. I‚Äôm having to learn a new way to speak, It‚Äôs not easy learning the apps I could connect with.  I simply want local news and tried to say the name as described by a local station, and It kept going to CNN or another news provider.  I‚Äôve tried listening to apple music, but I‚Äôm not home much to enjoy it.  I tried games and meditation skills.  The trivia game was fun, I was able to challenge other owners.  The meditation music was odd.  Not at all calming. The sleep app did put me to sleep once. I‚Äôm not impressed with Alexa. I really thought it would be neat to have, but it‚Äôs a struggle to say the right words that activate what I‚Äôm asking for.	3	May 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I‚Äôll be returning it because every day for the month that I‚Äôve had it, it loses the wifi for no reason.

Echo Dot	It is a  somewhat cool product, but there are clearly issues in operation.Smartlight.It found my Philips Hue Go lamp and could control it. At first. Then lost the connection and in spite of having it discover devices and finding it, it then failed to communicate. Many attempts of that and it finally worked again. And if can of course just select base colours, the moods the Hue has in the app won‚Äôt work. So functionality with the Hue smart lights is somewhat limited, the AI of the Echo isn‚Äôt good enough.SpotifyAttempt 1. Holy s**t, what a mess! I have a playlist on my Spotify. I use that because you can add whole albums to it, so it is the normal way to do it. Also I can pick different playlists for different purposes. Of course just the way a music service having playlists is supposed to work. But with the Echo it failed 100 %. When I asked it to play my playlist it either played some raining song (far from my kind of music too) or some Spotify radio station. If I asked it to play Suppers ready with Genesis it played ‚ÄúGenesis radio on Spotify‚Äù. If I asked it to play my liked songs it played, yes you guess correctly, something random that I do not like. After a while it started to play ‚Äúdaily mix one‚Äù. Hmmm‚Ä¶..Attempt 2. I unlinked and relinked the Spotify account and after that it works better. But not as it should. I can now actually get it to play the song I ask it to or the artist I ask for. That‚Äôs an improvement. But my playlist, nope won‚Äôt work. If I ask it ‚ÄúAlexa, play my playlist One‚Äù it tells me ‚ÄúPlaying your liked songs‚Äù. And it does play my liked songs. Only thing, to get my music there I have to add every single song manually, which is quite a lot. And of course I can only have one library liked songs, I can‚Äôt use different playlists.So that‚Äôs where I stand now. It works, but only to play Liked songs. Using a playlist seems to be impossible for me, and that is in my opinion a severe functionality problem. I think for a Spotify user Google Home is a better alternative since google Assist seems to work better with Spotify.Maybe using Amazon Music works better and Amazon makes the functionality with Spotify inadequate on purpose. But for me Amazon Music is not an option. And if there is an alternative for Spotify on the device, you‚Äôd think it should be able to play playlists.All in all these things lower the grade quite a lot.	3	February 19, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I have an Echo Dot 1st Generation and a 2nd Generation Echo.  I decided to update both Echo's and add to my household for more quality and help from Alexa.  I had noticed that the speaker of 1st generation dot was starting to sound a bit off, like a cracked speaker, and Alexa wasn't responding as well as before (but she heard me better than this new one), hence the update of the dot.  And the upgrade for the original Echo 2nd Generation was because of the Zigbee hub (I updated to Echo Plus 2nd Gen).  That all being said...The Echo 3rd Generation Dot in the kitchen doesn't hear me very well (the old one did a better job).  Many times I will ask Alexa to add things to my shopping list and she gets it totally wrong or I hear the new Echo Plus 2nd Generation in the other room pick it up.  Also if I tell her to set a timer in the kitchen, again many times she doesn't hear me or the other one will pick it up.  I figure the reason the other Echo (in another room) hears me is because I am having to shout at Alexa to do what I am asking; set a 10 min timer, add eggs to the shopping list, ect.  Very annoying!Not to be all negative on the 3rd Generation, if I do play music on the Everywhere Group setting it isn't to bad sounding, but it is in my kitchen (my hub) and I need to be able to request to her to add things to the shopping list, set timers and she needs to be able to hear it correctly and not make me shout at her.Lastly, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation sound quality (when she does hear you) is way off.  I have tried repeatedly to bring up the sound quality (less base / muffled sound) for use in just the kitchen.  The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is way to muffled sounding, and sadly this one is going somewhere in the household where it will be rarely used and I will bring the old one back out of retirement...at least I could understand the Echo 1st Generation more, with no muffled sound, and she heard me way better than the Echo 3rd Generation.  I am disappointed in this Echo 3rd Gen Dot and glad it was on sale, per it wasn't worth the 50.00 original asking price.  I do enjoy the Echo Plus 2nd Generation with the Zigbee Hub, but it is in a different room, and I do play music through it.	3	December 8, 2019	1

I even  bought a new Gen 3 Dot for my second floor. I installed the app on my tablet and got started. Initial set-up was fairly easy, almost intuitive. Voice recognition is very good. The smart devices were another matter. I spent almost an hour trying to get my first bulb working only to discover that it was bad. Switched bulbs and the second worked just fine. Sound quality is good but, oddly enough,  actually better on the older Dot! Over all these Dots seem a lot like the Fire tablet I bought several years ago. Well made, interesting, but little more than an enticement to rent, purchase, or stream content from Amazon. It can't do a thing with the 7000+ files in my audio collection.Home integration has so far been disappointing. 25% of the bulbs I bought are/were defective. They work fine as plain LED bulbs, so they'll get used, but they don't respond to the Dots. And the dimmer switch I bought for our chandelier won't work either. I'm not giving up just yet, home integration/automation is too appealing.	3	January 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I have 12 alexa echo devices in my house.  Mostly dots, but I have a couple of shows as well.  For a long time all was well.  I kept adding to my network.  I have almost every light switch in my house moved to a smart switch.  I can open and close my curtains through alexa, and I have enjoyed using it as an intercom to the kids rooms using the drop in feature.  But recently, she has been getting stupid.Issue 1: Recently, I tried to drop in on my son, by saying, ""Alexa, drop in on [NAME]"".  This has always worked in the past.  Lately, at least half the time, she asks me, ""Do you mean [son's name/daughter's name]?  And I say no.  And she asks me who do I want to drop in on.  I tell her, and she is stuck asking me if i mean something else.  Now, the only think I can think of is that she has access to my phone's address book since my son has my daughter's old phone number.  What the heck?!?!  And Amazon doesn't seem to monitor their own help forums to even provide help.  So scratch that one off the nice feature list.Issue 2:  Forgets some skills, and seems to install others I don't want.  I am using a pretty obscure wifi enable controller to open and close some large curtains.  It worked for over a year.  Then one day, it just stopped working through alexa.  Still works through the manufacturer supplied app.  I looked in my skills, and the skill for that device is just gone.  All of my routines are still there, and refer to the skill in the settings, but the skill isn't there and when I redownload, I can't sync to the original account.  So scratch that off the nice features list.Issue 3:  The most basic smart home control:  Light switches.  I have two rooms that she has become stupid about.  The garage and the study.  I have always been able to say, ""Alexa, turn on/off the garage/study lights.""  And she has done it perfectly until now.  Now most of the time, she responds, ""The garage/study doesn't support that.""  What the heck?  So scratch that off the nice features list.If all you want to do is ask what the temperature is, then go ahead an buy an echo device.  Otherwise, I would say that this is giving amazon a huge black eye.  There are so many similar questions as mine on line, and even on the alexa page right here on amazon.  But amazon doesn't answer the question.  Seriously, this is self-proclaimed to be the most customer-centric company in the world, and you can't get simple trouble-shooting help!"	2	March 30, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Not Necessary in my daily life	3	September 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Me gusta mucho sus funciones ,pero mi queja es q pago $9.99 por dos bocinas,y no las puedo usar al mismo tiempo!!!se detiene una ,si la otra funciona,y si pides que suene m√∫sica, dice q est√° usando amazon music, en otro dispositivo!!es realmente molesto,por que pago ,por dos bocinas!!	3	August 4, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I really only purchased this as a Bluetooth speaker and smart home integration, but if I get one more ‚Äúby the way‚Äù unsolicited tip, I‚Äôm throwing this away and getting a Google assistant. One of the most annoying features that I can‚Äôt turn off!	3	August 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Sound is not as good as my original echo.	3	September 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I am giving one star so that MAYBE someone at amazon will read this.  I keep volume low on my echo devices. I have 7 in my house.  SEVEN.  I loved them... until recently.When I quietly ask the echo right next to me for the weather, an echo halfway cross the house will answer and I can't understand what it is saying.The new conversational stories and personality is awful and makes me wait to get the info I asked for.I can't turn off ""By the way"" anymore and that is super frustrating.I'm trying to fall asleep.  I say ""Alexa, play night forest sounds"" and have to listen to ""By the way, did you know that there is a bunch of services that you will never be interested in that I can tell you al lot of details about?  They are available for a very reasonable cost and are totally something you want to hear me talk about while falling asleep, right?  Would you like to buy them right now?""I keep my devices very quiet but these messages seem to override my volume setting.The result is that I am using my echo less and less each day.  I have purchased 2 google devices.  Let's see if they can replace what echo updates has lost for me."	1	November 7, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Two complaints and one thing of note.- It worked wonderfully. All I did was plug it in. Then one day  got new internet (my portal died). Since then all it does is tell me to download the ap, and it will fix everything. I dl'ed it. Is there a setup button, yep. Connecting it? Not a clue. There is no Connection/Communication button. I have been through every menu of this ap and nothing helps.Complaints- I bought a 2nd Alexa, it works f'ing amazingly well in spite of being about as far as I dare use the wi-fi correctly. It has no connectivity issues, WTF.- Apple: An advertisement that plays every other commercial break where the people say ""Alexa"" that activates mine so it can tell me to DL the ap every 15-minutes...somewhere an advertisement executive needs to be shot.Oh, and one more thing...- I reached the point where I honestly could turn off my alarm to wakeup and still be asleep. No, seriously. I am conscious just enough to find the snooze button but not to become awake. So IO figured ""Hey, why not get an Alexa? I can set and cancel alarms much easier, it confirms them, and in my dream state I cannot speak 'alexa' and I need to be awake to recognize the source, so it will guarantee I wake up."" Problem:Alexa does not have a separate ""alarm volume"" setting. If you want a loud alarm, you need to set it to max volume for everything. I want to here my morning music playing at a 4 or 5 even if it takes a 9 to wake me up."	2	June 21, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The echo dot seemed to respond slow and inaccurate at times....also sound quality not to good to listen to music.	3	August 29, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The sound quality on this and the other one I ordered is not great. It is very bassy, hard to hear, and if you turn it up, its too loud. The voice quality is fine, it is just the speaker that isnt great. But, we use it every day for weather and other info it provides.	3	July 27, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Not much to say, I tell her to play, she dang sure better play. I like to talk to Alexa while I‚Äôm enjoying some home grown goodness. I tell her Alexa, play me some Cross Canadian ragweed. She says OK. And then it starts singing them boys from Oklahoma roll their cigs all wrong. They‚Äôre too dang skinny or way too long. Well I ain‚Äôt no holy roller so I just use a tong . Them boys from Oklahoma roll their cigs all wrong. Them boys down in Norman they got a kinky streak. Ain‚Äôt allowed to roll their own. Their Sooner wrist are too weak. They‚Äôll sure start to puffin if you put one in their beak. Well them boys in Colorado they just as soon pan for gold. The nights are too long and growin season is too cold. They‚Äôd just as soon smoke a cig that Jason Boland had rolled. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told. Well them boys down there in Texas got some dang good cigs. That‚Äôs probably why they play such horrible football. Them dang Cowboys ain‚Äôt gonna win a super bowl in my lifetime. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told.	3	February 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"On many many occasions, more often than not, I have to yell loudly at her multiple times for her to ""wake up"". I have repeated the same command many times and she will not recognize sometimes. I was surprised by the quality of sound though! I play music through it and the speaker is rather good for it being so small! Overall rating? 6/10, I'd go for a newer model than the 2018 if that's even a thing. Only say that because hopefully they fixed/tweaked some things! May I also add, it's very creepy when i have to scream at her to hear me but she'll randomly go off in the middle of the night and I go in and listen to what she heard and it's something creepy, one night she heard and recorded ""mother"" when my room was absolutely silent. So maybe turn yours on mute over night üòÇ"	3	May 17, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The device works as intended, but echos frequently try to provide data other than what I ask for. That's annoying and I have to tell it to stop all the time.	3	August 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I just had to unplug the Amazon Echo Dot in my bedroom. I am a very light sleeper, and this device randomly lights up, blinks, and beeps. I have checked the app on my phone. I have tried asking Alexa to stop blinking. I may not plug it back in. I was using it for white noise, weather reports, and occasional music when I‚Äôm getting ready in the morning. It is much nicer at night keeping her unplugged.	3	July 5, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I like that you can request just about any song and it will play. I do not like that it listens to ALL conversations and starts identifying names with their voice, creepy!	3	August 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I own 5 of these. This is brand new. Constantly going offline, says my connection or password must have changed (they haven't) and I have to reset it over and over and over. Get ready Amazon, another worthless item is heading back.	3	July 30, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Changes wake word to ziggy.  With 3 other echoes in house, system wouldn't respond... a nightmare to figure out as reboots didn't work and there is no customer service	3	August 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I really like that I can use this to operate my tv. I don't like that it has to stay plugged in at all times.	3	August 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I'VE HAD TWO ORIGINAL ECHO DOT FOR YEARS.  Decided to update, PURCHASED THE THIRD GENERATION.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  STOPS WHEN WE MAKE A PHONE CALL; CHANGES STATIONS AUTOMATICALLY, AND has developed a ""bit of attitude"".  The previous Amazon.Alexis app doesn't work only with the NEWER Alexis  for computers connection.  In fairness, I now have a Wi-Fi connection.  Amazon's CUSTOMER SERVICE is unable to help."	3	July 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	it is nice and easy but needs to be rebooted fairly frequently...	3	August 26, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The device is a cool gadget, a nice audio speaker with some smart features. For the most basic users it probably is more than necessary to enjoy audio with some smart functions on the side. Unfortunately if you are a power user, and say decided to have several of these and use 2 each as stereo speakers for your computers, you will realize the few but serious issues; Sound synchronization & annoying, totally unnecessary notifications of which device is connected and currently playing, are a huge deal breaker. The sad part is, that at least the notifications should be an easy fix, but lack a simple functioning switch to prevent that. The audio sync does work well if some app plays the audio, but used on a computer the audio will shift and lag behind (tested with various setups).	3	May 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I could not get the  alexa app to work on my phone...need help or I may have to return it...I am a senior and not too familiar withg teck nology..	3	August 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It's not that powerful as far as sound.	3	September 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The price was good but you only get what you pay for	3	August 30, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs our 2nd 3rd gen dot-was purchased to replace 1st gen echo-not even close to the echo, respond, sound, volume-and not as ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù or strong as the older dot , however the $30 w/tax makes it still a good deal	3	July 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have a dyfferent echo as well.  This one seems to have a more muffled sound than my first one	3	August 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It did everything it said it would and I was amazed with how well it answered questions BUT.. I bought 3 of these and all three only lasted about a year until it started having major problems. The speaker got very static-y, when I would set a timer with it, I couldn‚Äôt add any more time to it but it wouldn‚Äôt tell me that. It would just ring at the initial timer amount set, so needless to say, I had a lot of uncooked meals. And,  It wouldn‚Äôt understand a lot of my simple inquiries that I‚Äôd asked before with no problem. So if you don‚Äôt mind replacing it annually, then it‚Äôs a handy thing to have. The speaker on it is pretty weak though. It‚Äôs better if you can hook up an external speaker to it.My least favorite thing about this Echo Dot is that the ideal volume for me doesn‚Äôt exist..ex: level 4 is too soft and level 5 is way too loud. Oh, and there‚Äôs too much bass in the voice and not enough treble so it‚Äôs hard to understand unless you‚Äôre right close to it. The microphone does have pretty good range though. Sorry that I didn‚Äôt measure how far, but I can‚Äôt do it now bcz they don‚Äôt work as well as they used to.My favorite thing about it is that you can configure it in Settings to not shut down after it answers your question so you can keep talking to it. I like this bcz it‚Äôs habit for me to say thank you after somebody answers my question and when it turns off and I say thank you I‚Äôm talking to dead air so when it hangs around it actually says you‚Äôre welcome or other things that appreciate you.Wow, am I needy!	3	June 19, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It's good so far	3	September 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The Good: It completes all of the basic tasks as intended.The integration is clever and user-friendly, but it isn't without flaws.With such a small unit, the audio quality is excellent.The voice recognition is also excellent. (To say the least, it's appreciation of my poorly pronounced Spanish sir-names (Music Artists) is amusing.)Small Footprint is small enough to fit almost anywhere without being obtrusive.The Bad: It lacks an internal memory function that allows it to remember and repeat information it has just delivered or performed - you can't ask it to repeat what it has just said. (This shocked me, and I believe it is a significant flaw that should be addressed in future releases.)It doesn't appear to have any logic circuitry, instead relying on a massive database of references and some basic cross-referencing to find and retrieve data with the Alexa integration. It does a decent job most of the time, but with smarter programming, it could be much better.A computer that isn't really intelligent. She's more of a junior librarian/assistant than an AI system of any magnitude. The sound quality could also use some improvement!Overview - a useful tool for mundane tasks such as timers, alarms, and reminders, as well as for fast fact checks (dates, history, latest news about a given person or subject). Notifies you when Amazon deliveries arrive at your door. For others, this could be the coolest thing ever for the house, as it can be used in conjunction with other smart devices to create a 'Smart Home.'But, in my opinion, this device isn't particularly intelligent - merely an adequate tool for performing routine tasks. It's used in this way, and the degree of complexity isn't quite as high as it should be. In my view, the technology is underwhelming.	3	April 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Sound quality bad.for info,music etc.	3	September 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	need better directions	3	September 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	If you have another person in your Amazon household account and they have an Alexa device that you don't want your Echo speaker connecting to it is almost impossible to disconnect your speaker from their device once it's connected. Not to mention that it's constantly switching profiles between me and the other user. They had to create an Alexa profile to disconnect my echo from their device. And now it constantly recognizes me as them whenever I speak. Very large headache dealing with this problem.	2	November 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	When I ordered this it was supposed to come with a smart light bulb which did not come with it. The Echo itself works great, but the fact it didn‚Äôt come with the bulb as advertised was disappointing.	3	July 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I don't know if it's the device or Amazon itself. But ever since I purchase this device Alexa Jeopardy has been nothing but a frustrating disaster. I couldn't leave a review on the Jeopardy site so I have to leave it here. Jeopardy on Alexa hasn't worked correctly since I purchased this device. It shuts off in the middle of a game. It skips questions . I absolutely refuse to upgrade, so I guess I'm SOL. So either Amazon is either deliberately messing with the program so people purchase the upgrade or something is wrong with my device. That would be odd, because the same thing is happening on my old device and my friend's new device. So, is Amazon doing this deliberately so people have to purchase an upgrade? Or have they simply been having problems with this for over a month now that they just can't seem to figure out? You take your pick. My ten-year-old could code better. Amazon has reached the point where you have to purchase Amazon in order to purchase from Amazon. You have to purchase Prime in order to purchase shows on Prime. Pretty soon you will have to purchase Amazon in order to purchase Amazon in order to make a purchase through Amazon. How much more money does Jeff Bezos need? Will his lust for money not be satisfied until he's a trillionaire? Or is he bleeding us dry by nickel-and-diming us to death because he's a stingy, greedy man? Amazon, fix your damn products!	3	August 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I purchased Alexa because I‚Äôve heard numerous things about how great it is from friends and family and how it supposed to make life easier. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed, but I also won‚Äôt say my expectations were met. My biggest problems with Alexa is how often she turns on or interrupts when she was never called upon. I can be watching a movie or a YouTube video and she turns on and says something. A lot of times I‚Äôm alone and in my bed and that‚Äôs very scary, but that‚Äôs not the worst of it. Around 1:00PM Alexa randomly seems to start reading me the daily news and I‚Äôm soo confused.... I don‚Äôt remember ever setting up something like that. Once again I get scared easily and this doesn‚Äôt help. I also cannot stand the default voice of Alexa. You‚Äôd think that with the amount of money Amazon has that they would allow for you to pick from a wide variety of voices. Alexa sounds too monotone and robotic for my liking. She‚Äôs also a bit high pitched which can be annoying. It‚Äôll be a great improvement if we can get different voices for Alexa! Lastly, I‚Äôm also troubled by the amount of privacy concerns I have read and seen about Alexa. It‚Äôs always on the back of my mind, and it doesn‚Äôt help when I‚Äôm sleeping and I happen to wake up and see a yellow or blue ring around Alexa. I can‚Äôt help but think what it‚Äôs doing. I‚Äôll have to go and check my history. I‚Äôm someone whose very interested in technology, I‚Äôm always looking to try out new tech, and while I‚Äôm glad I tried out Alexa, I can also just as easily live without it.	3	May 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Sound is muffled. I upgraded from my first generation echo for a better sound quality. This sound is louder but far more muffled	3	August 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"So, I have a slew of 1st and 2nd gen Dots - more than I need, really. But I ended up having a scenario where it would be nice to be able to pair a FireTV with a Dot to pipe the sound through, and looked into the ""Home Theater"" function which pairs a 3rd Gen Dot with newer Fire Sticks and TVs. Short version: it doesn't work, so avoid if that's your intention.---About Home Theater---We have a Fire Stick that the app will see as available to use for Home Theater, but when I try to select this new 3rd Gen Dot it is greyed out and says it is incompatible. I also have another Stick on the same network that isn't that old, but it isn't even an option to try pairing anything to.  I'm so tired of Amazon's ""ecosystem"" of devices working so incredibly poorly with one another.Their Connect voice quality sucks, this feature sucks, the compatibility between generations for something as seemingly simple as playing an audio stream from FireTV on your Dot? Sucks. I'm not sure why they can't get it working on older devices, but that's annoying. What's more annoying is when you buy a product specifically for the task, which Amazon says should work, only to find it doesn't.---Sound Quality---These 3rd Gen dots still sound really quite poor - if you want to listen to music, you'll still have to output them to a dedicated speaker or suffer weak, muddy sound that lacks both clarity and depth. When you compare to something like a $15ish Logitech X50 bluetooth speaker, I have no idea how this thing can be AC powered and still sound so crappy in comparison. It's better than the earlier gens, but that isn't hard to do as the sound quality was quite possibly the worst sound I'd ever heard.---Conclusion---Ultimately, I'm done trying. I'll find another way. The features compared to Google Assistant based speakers are entirely lacking, and the sound quality still isn't good enough. Glad I got this Dot on the cheap because it allowed me to learn not to invest in Amazon devices like this anymore. Each generation ends up siloed from previous ones so you'd have to buy newer ones for simple additions, and even then they don't even work!Disappointing."	3	December 12, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"I have multiple echo dots, but am seriously considering moving to Google.As Amazon must know, one of the most used features of the echo is listening to music, which used to work great with Prime Music, but Amazon recently decided to ruin Prime Music with the annoying shuffling the song you requested and ""similar songs"" nonsense at a time when they are raising rates.Can I get rid of Thursday Night Sportsball and get Prime Music back, please?"	2	November 4, 2022	0

Echo Dot	This is my 2nd Echo Dot & it annoys me often üò° I‚Äôm usually beside it when speaking to it & it either doesn‚Äôt respond or says it can‚Äôt do what I ask. My 1st Echo Dot understands me every time ; even our Alexa Prime device does well. I wanted to exchange it in hopes it would work better, but because I got a Prime deal on this one , I was told I‚Äôd be charged a significant difference if I did. I chose to keep trying to use this one. I still might be returning or risking an exchange	2	October 26, 2022	0
Echo Dot	This review is more about the poor customer service, which is just as important to any merchandise quality.  This dot is less than a year old and a couple months ago a section of the red ring light came on and won‚Äôt turn off.  I have tried unplugging it and resetting it several times but the red light won‚Äôt turn off.  Not only is it annoying, but it causes the echo to get warm since it is constantly on 24/7.  Since Amazon customer service is almost non existent, I‚Äôve had to resort to google searches to try and find a solution, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any.	2	October 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	No review	3	August 30, 2022	1
Echo Dot	My family has two other ones in the house so calling Alexa would set them all off. I changed the name of it so it fixed the problem. Glad they added that option. However, it‚Äôs very sensitive so if I say anything that even sounds like it it will go off. And when I call it when I actually need it it will sometimes ignore me.It also won‚Äôt let me change my alarm tone aswell.Also you can‚Äôt name it you have to choose between the four names it gives you. I wish it would let us pick since my family is already planing to have one in each room (everyone likes to listien to music and so plan to have everyone have one for their each room) and there isn‚Äôt enough name selections and will cause them to have to have the same name :(	3	April 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The speaker doesn't have the best sound quality of what your expecting since it‚Äôs only $30. But will do the job as an voice assistant.	3	July 28, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs great like the version with the clock on them better	3	August 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"TL:DR - This is a perfectly fine bluetooth speaker and well worth what I paid for it (99 cents with an Unlimited Music subscription of 7.99 which you can immediately cancel if you wish) but don't expect voice command functionality to impress.To be frank, I didn't buy this device to listen to the weather, control the lights in my house, or operate a home security system.  My phone can tell me the weather, and light switches and manual locks have worked fine so far.  I got this because I like listening to music or videos while I cook, clean, and work on the computer at my table.  So basically I'm in it for a bluetooth speaker.  And I have to say, it's kind of neat to have a bluetooth speaker that accepts voice commands.  The problem is in how it responds to those voice commands.Me: ""Alexa, set the volume to fifty percent.""Alexa: ""Sorry, you can only set the volume between zero and ten.""Me: ""Alexa, what is fifty percent of ten?""Alexa: ""Fifty percent of ten is five.""This is the problem I've had with every voice assistant I've encountered so far.  You can't speak to them in everyday language using simple concepts that a computer should be able to understand.  Alexa should be smart enough to know that fifty percent is the same as five out of ten.  If you can't give the device simple, direct commands and have those commands be understood, then why have voice control?As far as a speaker goes, this is about what you would expect from a bluetooth speaker of this size.  You're not going to get clear and sparkling highs, but the overall sound is strong and there's the perfect amount of bass response if like me you enjoy music but also live in close quarters and aren't trying to disturb the neighbors.5 stars for Voice recognition - It knows what I'm saying.2 stars for Alexa integration - The device understands my words, but it doesn't know what they mean or act on them.4 stars for Sound quality - I hoped for a bit more clarity, but this is perfectly adequate for a speaker of this size and cost."	3	December 14, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"Pros & ConsPros:- Voice recognition- Easy set up- Wireless Connection- Not bad sound quality- Able to turn off micCons- No internal battery (Did not say it had one)- Software has MANY issues (will go into in review)- Sound is not SUPER loud- Quality deteriorates at high volumeSo I have not had this long, having arrived mid day the just the day prior (had about 1.5 days now) but I have had many issues with it. I thought it would be better, being the third gen. I'll start with the issues with it, and then go on to what I like.I have been using it with Spotify, as well as a speaker for my computer. For Spotify, numerous times it has just not done what I told it. Its playing a playlist, I say ""Play %s from Spotify"", where %s is whatever, does not actually matter. It says Sure playing *whatever said* and then the music pauses for a brief second, and goes back to playing whatever it was playing before, with no change. The device heard me, recognized what I said, acknowledged it was requested to do it, and then did nothing. I would try numerous times in a row, and it would still not do as it was meant to (Again this is a software issue). Next, using it as a speaker. Numerous times it just stops playing sound. I change my speaker back to the built in sound on my laptop, and sound comes out, switch it back to the echo, and nothing. My laptop has no issue having sound come out, and the music is playing, the echo just refuses to output it. I have restarted the laptop, and messed around with the sound settings nothing changes it. I've changed what app the sound is coming out of, still nothing. The solution I've found, is unplugging the echo and plugging it back in, but I could have to do this even up to 3 times an hour. To me, that proves the issue is the echo, not the laptop. Of course, the issue is not always present.So onto the good. The devices voice recognition is honestly not bad, but I would say if you have an accent, lisp, or mumble, it will have lots of issues. Now that may improve with time, but that I cannot speak to. The set up is easy, all it requires is the mobile app, or I believe it can be accessed via a web page. Their is many features/apps one can install so it may interact (aka Spotify). It does not need to be connected to ones phone to work, which is nice. It has a button to turn off the mic, so it will no longer listen/record. I quite like that, but I cannot speak to whether it actually does stop listening and recording, I'd almost be willing to bet it doesn't, but idk.I got it with the special deal with amazon music unlimited, so I spent almost $10 all in all (one month music included). For that price it may be worth it, but I would absolutely not pay 40/50+ for this, especially with all the issues. As a whole not happy with the device so far. If anything changes, I will update this review to reflect.I will say, their customer service is absolutely wonderful. I got a call from them with regards to my issues mentioned above, before this review even went live."	2	June 18, 2020	0
Echo Dot	This is perfect to use on my deck. It was easy to connect to my indoor Alexa. However, the one outside has poor sound quality. It doesn‚Äôt seem to affect  the one inside.	3	July 16, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"This is a review for the device, and more importantly, Amazon Music and Alexa android apps.I received this as a promotion from Amazon where I got this for 99c with a subscription to Amazon Music at $9.99/mo.First off, the device itself seems pretty nice, the sound quality is good, but voice recognition is lousy. Even after training it.However, as this was to be used for Amazon Music and podcasts, it is beyond useless. Voice recognition doesn't recognize artists names or track titles. After several retries you are better off just going to the Amazon Music app.But, and here is where the issue is, the Amazon Music app and Alexa app are garbage. Absolutely terrible. Amazon Music somehow has screen refresh issues. It fails to load the screen, or goes into some dizzying refresh cycle where it loads over and over and over. That or it just displays a black screen.If you are lucky enough to actually find a track or artist you want to play, then hit the play buttonn, there is a rediculously long delay on the order of 5-10 seconds where it thinks about doing it.And then the buffering, oh the buffering. It appears they don't use one. It repeatedly skips and pauses, even on a a 280Mbs WIFI signal and 4G cell service. Its useless.And then, it will crash on you.And for the Alexa app, it crashes repeatedly. I have to click the ""close app"" button when Android indicates it has crashed in the background. This occurs roughly 4-5x per day.So, here I am with a device that seems capable, but the applications to use with it are garbage. What an ecosystem! Way to go Amazon. Hire some real developers please.I canceled my music subscription immediately. There's $10 wasted. Now I have a device that I was hoping to use for music and podcasts, and now I can't.Avoid if you plan on using this for music streaming."	2	January 19, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt know how to use it.	3	August 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It sounds like Alexa is speaking from the bottom of a barrel.  Too much bass and not enough high frequencies.  This can be resolved somewhat by using an amplified speaker, such as one of the OontZ models.  Turn the Dot volume down and use the OontZ speaker's amplifier at max.  Then bring up the Dot volume until the output is usable.	3	June 26, 2022	1
Echo Dot	when it works, it's great. I bought 2 smart plugs. The first worked great, then it just stopped, so I bought another new smart plug, from AMAZON that one doesn't work either. Now it stopped playing music. It said it is a router problem, but my router works with all my other electronics. I have tried turning both the alexa and the router off MANY times, no change. I am VERY disappointed. I guess I have to cancel my alexa. I'd really rather not, but it's no good the way it is.	3	June 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I was disappointed because I wanted a small Bluetooth speaker to use on the go. I work in a different location every day and it requires a Wi-Fi set up everywhere I go, which isn‚Äôt always possible. I might use it at home instead.	3	July 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Pandemic play toy has become more than just a toy.  I like so much about it that it would be hard to send her packing.  Tried just one to start.  Then had to add 2 more.  Wanted to try the stereo feature and put one in another room. They worked very well for several months until I finally tried to set up the stereo feature.  It has been downhill ever since.  I have told Alexa that she better behave or start packing.I lost most of my programed responses that I added to the Skills or Blueprint.  Controlling my smart plugs failed.  Reset that up and now it is hit or miss.A big issue for me is the capability of asking to play an individual song is no longer available.  Then I have to listen to her long speech about paying for Music Unlimited to have that feature back.  I have never and will never pay a monthly fee to hear music.Now I also have to listen to commercials which never happened in the past.  I have a suspicion that eventually, once many users are hooked, everyone will have to pay to listen to music.I am now resorting to pulling her plug when one of the long sales pitches starts or a commercial comes on.  It takes more time for the re-connection,  but that is how annoyed I feel.Looks like I may have to reset the triplets of Alexa  and start over.I would rather have no stereo and all the functions working like before.	3	April 27, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Edit:Still 3 stars I won‚Äôt give more but definitely will less of it continues to be a frustrating paperweight. Also I never gave consent for Amazon to ‚Äúpool‚Äù my Wifi for my neighbors Sidewalk is a big fat PERMISSION NOT GRANTED!!Original review:I bought this through an Amazon deal at Best Buy. I received 2 for the price of 1 and got 2 smart bulbs as well, during their ‚Äúearly Black Friday deals‚Äù. Let me start by saying I wanted this for 2 reasons and it disappointed on both. 1)To make calls for work to the carriers (most require to push ‚Äúx‚Äù to get to the correct area and this won‚Äôt do that :( ) it works for the carriers I don‚Äôt have to select a choice or to call my account reps ect. Sound quality is spot on and it does a great job on listening in on meetings ect to take notes so I trade one for the other. 2) to use to listen to music and pod casts as I work or sleep. If Alexa would pick a better variety then this would be perfect. But example: I say Alexa play 80‚Äôs music and it chooses the exact same station that plays the exact same songs over and over. If I say ‚ÄúCountry Love Songs‚Äù it plays the Country Love category on my IPhone gahhh. Alexa doesn‚Äôt seem to understand certain things and the routine and tasks I added don‚Äôt seem to work. Idk I will mess with this one a little more as I am new to all of this but it‚Äôs frustrating and may be returned. Best part: you can mute the echo and no accidentally calling or recording a call or conversation and I can ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù and make sure my home is safe when I am away.	3	November 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It has a hard time hearing me sometimes the sound quality is ok it's alright purchase though I don't regret buying it	3	July 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	If you just need something to take your aggression out on, this is it! I threw the first one out the door into a rainstorm and was happy after that.....Then, thinking maybe I was hasty or maybe improvements had been made to Alexa, I bought a second Dot. This one makes me crazier than the first. I cannot believe how much time I have wasted trying to pair it with lights, plugs, etc, and if you have set custom answers you have to remember to ask Alexa EXACTLY how you set it up. If you have an IPhone, Siri does the same job 150% better with no setup!Do not waste you time, money, or patience with Alexa!	2	October 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Junk	3	August 19, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"We have all been dealing with the exact same issues for a while, without update.I was reserving judgement until they had a chance to update, but that is not going to happen.This is going to pick on the device as an integral part of Alexa.As a stand-alone blue-tooth speaker, It is fine, except for it's lack of battery.However, due to it's lack of battery, I would call that function ancillary.Ups:They are super-easy to get running.Some of the smart home features are really nice, and easy to develop for.Sound quality is excellent (for a tiny speaker).The (occasional) price point can't be beat.The build quality is excellent.Downs (Major):Multi-room audio constantly looses sync or drops devices. This would have been a deal-breaker had I known it going in.There is little to no management of individual devices.The trigger words are often misheard in general conversation, leading to general nonsense.Downs (Minor):Connectivity is an occasional issue, often requiring a manual reboot.(Amazon, if you are listening and tell me to check my network, I will tell you to sit in the corner.)Voice Recognition is functional, but you must know how to address it.The rules:  #1 - Background conversation must not be happening. This includes radio or TV. Volume does not matter.  #2 - Background noise must be as minimal as possible.  #3 - Speak the trigger word, then wait a second before the command. A 2-count is fine.  #4 - Enunciate with exaggeration! Monotone will not pass with Amazon. Use that stage voice!  #5 - Do not pause while speaking the command.Whisper mode is a lie.Amazon knows very little about pricing and information about Amazon services. Don't bother asking.""Internet searches"" are basically a mess. Good luck.Your location will be guessed. It will be wrong. It does this way too often. It ignores what you enter at setup."	3	April 27, 2020	1
Echo Dot	My son bought this for me for Christmas. At first it seemed to work fine. I have terrible ringing in my ears and a little hard of hearing so she is hard to understand sometimes. I wish there was a way to adjust the pitch of her voice.  I do like the sound of the speakers when playing music.  I have reminders set which have worked awesome until today all the sudden they were all had just disappeared. I had to re add them. No clue what happened as my routines were still there. The routines that play music I have a lot of problems with play on my AMAZON PLAYLIST. The routine will either not start or it will cut off short of what was scheduled. This happens for all the music I have set which is 4 of them at various times of day. The routines set that are non music seem to work great like my smart plug. Although I want my volume set to 5 during the day (after playing night music at 2) and when set in the routine she does not do it. I really have a love hate relationship with her at this point as I have to  manually start my songs majority of the time. When I verbally try to get her to play one of my playlists she gets it wrong most the time. I need my sleep music to be reliable due to severe insomnia issues and the music routines are just not reliable on my Alexa. Will go back to using my old boom box for my sleep music I guess.	3	March 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I am (unfortunately) fully invested in Amazon devises.  I have at least one echo in every room of my house, and a fire stick on every tv.  A total of 12 echos/dots/shows plus an echo sub and 6 fire sticks.  When they work right, they are a wonder of technology.  For a fraction of the price of a Sonos, you can have whole home audio, plus integration with light switches and bulbs as well as home automation.  I use the echos for my shopping lists, reminders, alarms and timers, as well as checking sports scores and weather and even asking what time it is if I‚Äôm too lazy of roll over and look at my phone.  Firesticks also play nice with echos (for the most part) so in my garage, I have a nice sound system with two echos for atmos stereo sound and a subwoofer connected to my projector and I don‚Äôt need to have any wiring except the hdmi to the fire stick and the power cables running to the echos.  Soooo why 2 stars?  Well, despite all these neat things they can do, that is their job.  That‚Äôs why I have over $500 invested into this system.  Ya, that‚Äôs a good price for what I have but that‚Äôs if these things worked correctly all the time.  Thing is, they only work right about 50% of the time.  Using Alexa is terrible.  It‚Äôs the biggest flaw.  It just doesn‚Äôt hear things right and if it were human, I would say it is one of the most stubborn people I know.  I am constantly repeating commands multiple times.  Sometimes I will be right in front of one talking in a bedroom and you get a response from one two rooms over.  It is an issue with alarms because you don‚Äôt want a kitchen alarm going off in someone‚Äôs bedroom, etc.  the other issue is audio drop-outs.  I will just randomly lose audio in different rooms.  Even right next to the router while other things are streaming.  Then it gets stubborn and won‚Äôt comeback until you go into another room and tell it to start up again in the room you want.  If you don‚Äôt, it will keep telling you it‚Äôs playing what you requested but just goes silent.  Tech support is a joke.  Protocol for everything is (turn everything off, router, modem, firesticks, echos and restart.  Ok, I do that and most of the time it fixes it but when these things happen again and again and again.  Spending 30 minutes doing that is not a solution.  They just need to make a better product.  Anyways, I‚Äôve seen plenty of people say ‚Äúoh I have no problems‚Äù. Ok good for you, and if you only have one echo dot, ya, you probably won‚Äôt see as many issues.  I‚Äôm just saying, I‚Äôve had 100‚Äôs and 100‚Äôs of tech devises and these (though they can do some neat things) are way too problematic to be satisfied with.  If I could do it over, I‚Äôd have gone with Google products for my smart home.	2	September 16, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I dont need to get up to turn on the TV or find the remote. They turn on and off the lights, they run schedules to turn on and off lights. They turn on plugs that operate fans.

Echo Dot	I just got my new Amazon Dot.  I'm having fun learning all she can do and it's still to soon to really review it but I have very early on discovered a very big, disappointing flaw I have to vent about.  I need to pick up my granddaughter at one time on Mon, Tues, Thurs & Fri and another time on Weds.  Unless I missed something, there is no way to set an alarm/reminder/notification/routine or whatever to do that on the Dot????  It's either every weekday or individually.  I guess once you got each one set up, it wouldn't be that big a deal but what about when her schedule changes, as it often does and you have to do it all over again.  I'll bet there are others out there who have different schedules thruout the week that will find it a pain also.  Or is my situation unique?  Having to set up an individual repeating alarm (or whatever) for Mon, then another one for the same time Tues, then another one for the same time Thurs, then another one for  the same time Fri and then still another different one for a different time on Weds is, ahem, less than ideal.  And you can't even exclude weekends!What were they thinking?  For something as 'smart' as this device is supposed to be, this is a really stupid omission.  Not everyone gets up at the same time everyday and we do have repeating schedules based on given days.  So right now, all my Dot does is turn off/on lights.  Which is cool, yes, but not as helpful as, say, a fully customizable alarm.	3	November 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The sound quality is not as great as my other ‚Äúball-shaped‚Äù Alexa device. The sound is not distributed very well & it sounds smothered.	3	July 17, 2022	1
Echo Dot	it is working	3	August 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The idea is that you would ‚Äútalk to it,‚Äù when in reality you give it limited commands, which in practice take more effort that we would really want. They are moving in the right direction but have a long way to go. The sounds quality does exceed what one would think for such a small item and the overall confection of the item is fairly good. It is heavier than it looks and Thai reflects overall good materials. The buttons could be a bit sturdier, to be inline with the overall quality. Given that it is at such a low price point, the use of it as a stand alone speaker that easily interfaces with other devices, and that it does have some benefit in terms of its ‚Äúsmart‚Äù capabilities and I think it‚Äôs pretty descent. If they charged more then it would go into the rip off category. Watch videos on YouTube and see how it is used. Then try to see how much benefit you get out of it, under those specific scenarios.	3	December 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	My main Issue with the Alexa dot is that it just stops playing at random, even if I choose a different radio station or streaming app it just stops playing. Ironically it doesn't stop playing if it's playing an audiobook.  If this problem can be fixed I'll give it all 5 stars	3	June 22, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I got this some time back and it‚Äôs a good smart speaker with some problems. I got 2 one for me and one for my mother. Mine is in my bedroom my mothers is in the living room and here are some problems. 1 I ask it to play Spotify and it try‚Äôs to play it on my Xbox, when I try to tell it to play on its self it plays on my mother‚Äôs dot and turns up the volume to max. 2 it does not listen I say Alexa the led ring turns blue, but it stops listening to me even when the room is silent and does not do what I tell it even when I ask 5 times. 3 when I tell it to set a timer for 5 minutes it tells me ‚Äúyou can also enable this skill‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can also say Alexa add 5 minutes‚Äù after the first couple of times is fine but after that is gets annoying. And it will do it every time with almost everything I tell it todo. Yes it‚Äôs worth the money the voice recognition is really good the speakers are excellent and Alexa is great when he is not being annoying.	2	June 8, 2022	0

Echo Dot	"At the urging of my children, we joined the Alexa crowd with the Echo Dot 3rd Gen in the kitchen.  First, the good things.  Installed easily and unobtrusive on the counter.  Can speak to it in a regular voice and it seems to understand both my wife and me without problems.  Able to create lists for various shopping trips, if we can go, without problems.  Able to stream SiriusXM with stations selected on command, as well as Pandora and Spotify.But ....  the sound quality of the Alexa voice is muddy, and sometimes hard to understand.  I boosted the treble and lowered the bass in the equalizer, did not seem to make much difference.  Not clear that mine is defective, as many others seem to have the same problem.  Although it can interface with a Roku, the commands are quite limited; it can run a Roku application, but not control it once loaded, so you still need the remote.  Seeking information, Alexa is often beaten by Google.  For example, I wanted to know when the local NFL team was playing, it was able to give me the time of the game.  But when I asked for the network broadcasting the game, ""I don't have that information"" was the response.  Google Assistant came through with the correct information.  This has happened with other searches as well.  Disappointing.So, overall, Alexa is good, but not great.  Music played through the speaker is acceptable, but not the Alexa voice.  Commands can be limited.  We have one, not sure if I need another."	3	December 20, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"I appreciate this product for my daughter, since she tends to ask a lot of questions of Alexa, but I don't like that I have to download extra items for something as simple as animal sounds. So if I ask Alexa what a chimp sounds like, I have to download an animal sounds ""app"" into the Alexa app to have it and then ask Alexa to use that animal app so I can ask what a chimp sounds like (an example of what I have to go through for my toddler daughter). Very foolish if you ask me. I don't like it. I just ask siri or Google and this usually collects dust."	3	April 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have an Echo Show 5 & 8 and they both sound much better than the 3rd. Gen Dot. I'm not sure why , but the 3rd Gen Dot will have a very distorted sound when Alexa is talking and most times when someone with a is talking. I returned the first one I received thinking it was defective, yet the replacement does the same thing. My other Echo devices don't have that distortion and I tested to see if it was my wi-fi connection by putting the Dot right next to my router. No difference. I'm not sure if the 4th Gen has an improved speaker, but I'm going with that model next time if I decide to buy an another Echo Dot and only if it's on sale.	3	March 8, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I have three 1st generation Echo Dots.  I traded two of them with 3rd generation.  The look is much bigger than the first.THE GOOD:The sound for this is good for a small speaker standard.  Although I listen to music connecting it to a Bose Bluetooth, this sound is much better compared to previous generation.THE UGLY:1) ALEXA CAN‚ÄôT HEAR YOU!!!  I have one in my kitchen‚Äôs island, and one top of the bed with 12 inches from my head (from below) while laying down.  While the device hears the ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù call because she beeps and you see the light, she can‚Äôt recognize your commands.  If you say ‚ÄúAlexa what did you hear‚Äù she‚Äôll tell you she didn‚Äôt hear anything in the last minute.  The one in the bedroom is 12 inches from my head and it‚Äôs the same thing. The devices will NOT respond to ANY whisper even though she heard ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt know what they did to the microphones but I‚Äôm almost certain they downgraded them.2) THE VOLUME.  The 1st generation‚Äôs volume was quite pleasant.  You could even set it to 1% from the app.  My bedroom is quiet, so at night I like low volumes.  The 3rd generation can‚Äôt seem to be low.  I set the alarm multiple times and that seems to be an issue too.  This is frustrating late at night.Overall the only upgrade is for sound. Everything else is a downgrade from the 1st generation.  If you never had a previous generation, you‚Äôll enjoy it.	3	October 26, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"I bought this for my livingroom and it worked fine for a couple hours... but then it loses its connection. I have an Echo Show in another room and it is working great. The Echo Dot IS connected to the internet but is having trouble talking through my router/firewall. After it has been plugged in for a couple of hours it trys to connect to ip address 192.0.0.2 which is an address used by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for IPv4 to IPv6 translation. This connection fails and the ECHO Dot stops working. The only response I get from the Echo Dot is ""Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now. Please try again a little later."" The Echo Show in the other room works fine all the time through the same router/firewall. Rebooting the router/firewall and Echo Dot sometimes fixes the problem but not always. Sometimes I have to wait several hours and then reboot to make it work again. FYI... my router/firewall is pfSense."	3	December 17, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Everything	3	August 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Well, I am happy that I kept myself up with the newest product I found very useful and practical and these smart speakers are just one of them. Unlike many others, I am using the echo environment in parallel with the Google assistant. The main reason of doing so comes from the compatibility issues and what these devices are programmed to cover. Yes, there are many similarities that you can get from both but if you are really into the smart assistant devices then you realize that the differences are remarkable and I wanted to have everything covered and connected so I am using both (Amazon echo and Google assistant). For obvious reasons, way bigger than what I can even encounter in here, Google is dominating the market when it comes to the speed and ease of use smart assistants and Alexa which is still quite better than Siri, Cortana and Bixby are still way far from Google on the second place. A great example of the differences here is like,when you are talking to an adult person vs you are talking to a kid! So with an adult you can speak freely and expect to get a response most likely than you are talking to a kid. I personally can't blame Amazon for what Google has been dominating solely for years and years ahead of everyone else so if you learned how to speak with this kid (Alexa in here), she is going to get the job done accurately and there's more, as I mentioned on the very beginning. It comes from the area of what one particular device covers and it's that important to get your attention to have the more compatible smart assistant for the tasks or other services you are planning to use. The bottom line here is the third generation of echo dot devices are the best of it's own kind and having them in parallel with Google assistant will do almost everything for what is doable in 2019 technology relm.	3	October 23, 2019	1

Echo Dot	Overall fun and useful. I've discovered a lot of new music with this. The sound quality is decent given the price and it's size. The one drawback is I'm bi-lingual, a lot of music I like is in Spanish and it has a hard time deciphering Spanish titles	3	June 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"""Alexa, do something.""""Sorry, I don't understand.""""Alexa, please do what I asked.""""Okay, doing something completely different.""""Alexa, stop!"" ""Alexa, please please do what I asked.""""Okay, doing something else completely different.""""Alexa, stop!"" ""Ok google, do this for me.""""Ok, done.""That's about the usual interaction with Alexa. Its voice recognition is BAD, and only correctly understands probably about two-thirds of the time. The other third of the time, it's really bad. If you're lucky, it will decide to define random words or play some random song instead of turning lights off or making a new reminder.  This is for native English speakers who lived in North America for life, probably speaking closest to their basic training data as possible; I can't imagine how it would understand a non-native English speaker or with non-American accents.Do I recommend it? Well, I half recommend it. When it works, it's quite useful, and has pretty good integration, but that's only when it works. You really have to jump through structural hoops and do it in exactly the right structure when asking for things (always always put ""am"" or ""pm"" on you time when setting alarms or reminders, since it likes to set these for the middle of the night), which can be very awkward and unnatural.The design of the companion app keeps changing and still doesn't seem to have a UX expert assigned to it, so it's horrible to navigate through (Google Home app is even worse though, so there's that). I use the reminders feature extensively to help the kids keep track of when to join online school meetings, but I have to go into the app several times a week to fix or create reminders that the voice interface can't do properly.Good: nice access to music and Amazon services (at least with Prime), good integration with wide variety of smart home servicesBad: bad voice recognition and intention understanding, clunky and rigid interface to access some features (you have to phrase it just-right), poor knowledge lookup results (i.e., web search)Comparison to Google Home: I've been using both for years. Echo/Alexa and Google Home are similar on the outside, but have very different (and opposite) strengths and weaknesses. Echo/Alexa are strong on music, Amazon services, and smart-home integration, while Google Home is strong on voice recognition and knowledge search (Google recently killed their good music offering) and ok on Google service integration. When they're on sale they're cheap enough to get both and use them for different things.Bottom line: Alexa raises your blood pressure when you interact with it because Alexa often doesn't understand, in comparison Google Home nearly always understands and does better search but has inferior integrations. Alexa with Google-quality voice recognition would be great, but it's nowhere near that."	2	October 27, 2020	0

Echo Dot	This review has been a LONG TIME COMING! Third generation echo is a piece of crap! It's cheap! It's unresponsive at times! It doesn't hear you very well or doesn't hear you at times at all! The second generation Echo was fast, always responsive, didn't take about half a second to a second to react (it was immediately), even the speaker power was stronger.I've had this piece of crap for 2 years and the 2nd generation for more than 5 years. They basically made a cheaper Alexa and implemented new cheaper features like less volume power when playing music and late response time as if there was a constant lag between you and the echo. I hate this piece of trash! The second generation is my favorite. I don't know how the 4th generation stacks up, but as I'm seeing more and more let's go cheaper, but sell it for more or the same price at Amazon. I'm not holding my breath for an even cheaper 3rd generation wanna be. Buy the second generation if you can or the speaker. DON'T BUY THIS THIRD GENERATION LET'S SAVE ON MONEY TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND SACRIFICE QUALITY FOR CORPORATE GREED, PIECE OF TRASH!!!Also, if you haven't noticed, why do you think they have this echo dot ALWAYS on sale or limited time price or they're giving it away with a 3 months subscription to whatever, keep the piece of trash and cancel the subscription anytime!? They are literally getting rid of it! WHY WOULD YOU WANT IT!?	1	August 31, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"It sounds good, but here are the problems I'm facing it with it:Sound often brakes: Often times when the Echo connects to the computer, the sound crackles.  I have to unplug the device reconnect to fix the issue.Bluetooth Connection Notification: This very ANNOYING device constantly notifies you when it connects to a bluetooth device.  It could be connected to the computer for 10 minutes without use, but as soon as you play some sound, it has to loudly and blaringly notify you of its connection.  It's very annoying.Alexa:  Often times, Alexa responds to a statement/comment I made that did NOT involve Alexa.  I find myself having to argue with Alexa telling her, ""I didn't call you, Alexa - mind yo' business!""Not portable: This thing is not portable... why did I think it was portable?  Why did I think this thing had a built in battery? .... Uggh...Volume: You can sync the volume with your bluetooth device, but the echo notification will always sound at the volume it is independently set on, for example: if you have the volume on low from your computer, and you're listening to it low from the Echo (because it's synced), and you receive a notification sound, that sound is going to be heard at the volume the Echo is independently set on (which is usually on high).Alexa...raise the volume: And she raises the volume slightly... slightly...."	3	February 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I ordered two echo dot 3's when Amazon had their ""big sale"".  One set up to wi-if no problem and has worked great since. The second one, I had to try several times to connect, before I was successful. But it did not stay connected and all I could get out of it was a "" I'm having difficulties at this time, please try later"" response. At times it would just start talking without even being prompted.Then it might work for a week or so before it wouldn't do anything. I reached out to customer service via chat. That chat lasted over thirty  minutes only to be "" disconnected "" before problem resolved.  Again I reconnected going thru all the steps.  Week later it didn't stay connected, so I called and talked to a "" electronic specialist "".  That call was over half an hour long. I tried requesting a return shipping label, so I could send it back and get a new replacement since it was a faulty device. I was told that is not an option. I would have to send it back and they would fix it.  I responded that I bought a new item and want a new one as a replacement, not a ""FIXED ITEM ""  He finally agreed to send out a NEW echo dot and I would have to return the original.  A few days later, I received a ""REFURBISHED"" echo dot 3.  When I called to speak to a  supervisor, I was told that it is their policy to send refurbished ones if a new one is not in ""their stock"".  Doesn't matter they have new ones to sell on the website. I told him that I don't except that and it was not what I paid for. And if they are sending out refurbished echos, there must be a huge problem with them. He advised that they test them and to try it out.  So I opened the box.  All that was in the box was the echo dot. No power source .  Again 4th time reaching out to a Tech specialist- supervisor and 45 minutes of phone time. I was told that they only send device out when replacing. And they don't send out any accessories. When was a plug considered an accessory when it is needed to use device.  Again I told him that I bought a new device and it was faulty and I wanted a new device as a replacement.  Not one that has been fixed.  Also I found out that the 90 day warranty did not begin again when the replacement device gets registered. They back date it to the original sell date of first device.  So I only had 40 days left on the warranty.  Also if you go on line , a refurbished echo goes for $29.99, compared to the $ 49.00 , for a new one. Not once did any representative say that I would be refunded the $20.00 difference for the refurbished echo dot. I told him that this is an AMAZON echo dot. It has their name on the product and they should stand behind their name. I also said if I were to buy a tv from a store and took it home and it quit working, they would replace it with a new tv, not a refurbished one. I will never buy another electronic device that AMAZON sells with their name on it. I will tell all my friends and family that they will get screwed if something goes wrong with their product. So buyer beware.  Amazon does not stand behind their products and the consumer whom keeps their  business Alive."	1	September 10, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I received mine today as part of the promo $.99 Echo Dot with Amazon music subscription. I thought great, here‚Äôs an affordable easily portable little speaker. I intended to use this as a Bluetooth speaker on camping trips and nothing else. First off, you can‚Äôt even pair your phone to the speaker without having the Alexa app. Second problem: you cannot pair your phone to the speaker if you do not have Wi-Fi. I do not have WiFi where I live. Third problem: the minute you unplug it from the power source it turns off - there is no power on and off button.I have no desire to use it for Alexa. I don‚Äôt use any of the assistant apps like Alexa - why? Well. Amazon records you. Don‚Äôt believe me? Look it up. I‚Äôve heard horror stories of Alexa recording private conversations and then somehow sending them out into the public. You can go online to view all of the recordings your device has on you. You can individually delete recordings as you choose but you cannot stop Amazon from recording you. It‚Äôs supposed to only record you when you use the word Alexa but somehow sometimes it records more even when you don‚Äôt want to.So. I will be sending mine back. It‚Äôs my fault for not reading more about the functions of this device and assuming I could trick it somehow to be used the way I want. I‚Äôm giving 3 stars just because I can‚Äôt say wether it works the way it‚Äôs intended to or not so I don‚Äôt want to leave just 1 Star but I also can‚Äôt give it 5.	3	June 15, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Working from home, I figured that an external speaker would improve the Zoom meeting experience compared to tinny laptop speakers, so I ordered an extra Echo Dot for $20 on Prime Day. The experience has been mixed. The Dot paired with my laptop easily and the sound quality was definitely better than the laptop speakers; however, despite the fact that the Dot sits right next to the laptop, the Bluetooth connection is not stable, occasionally disconnecting and reconnecting for no discernible reason (and loudly announcing itself when it reconnects during a meeting).  I thought an easy fix would be to connect the Dot to the headphone jack of the laptop using a 3.5mm cable, but discovered to my dismay that the 3.5mm jack on the back of the Dot is an output only, not an aux input.  In other words, you can use the Dot to play music on external speakers, but you cannot play audio from an external source on the Dot.  To get a jack which handles both output AND input, you need to buy one of the more expensive Echo devices (e.g., the $100 Echo Gen 4 or the $200 Echo Studio).  No thanks.  For the huge price difference, I will make do with the annoyance of the occasion Bluetooth connection problems.	3	July 25, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Overall not bad for free. Voice recognition is so-so at times I find my self walking towards the device till it picks up the simplest commands. Volume is OK but turn it up too loud and the speakers crackle a lot. Even though it's last Gen. still integrates with my other Alexa enabled smart devices nicely.	3	June 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Has good sound though.	3	July 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Handy for reminders	3	July 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I got it for a steal deal, but practically that didn't add anything to me. It's completely wired and needs a constant power supply, and voice recognition was so mediocre typically and worse while playing something, which makes us scream so much. We have Echo Dot with us for namesake, but this device doesn't have many use cases at all for me. I can completely skip the product if I should.	3	May 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	my daughter likes to play games with it, and it often misunderstand her which leaves her frustrated	3	July 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Equally as convenient & helpful as it is frustrating & inaccurate. It makes life so much easier, but at least once a day I want to hit it with a hammer... also available on Amazon. Voice recognition is not great, & frequently gives incorrect answers to questions, but still, I can't imagine life without it.	3	June 2, 2022	1
Echo Dot	sound quality is poor	3	July 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Handy device, except when it's not, which is quite often.  Buy buying and using this not only am I subjected to ads (can't turn them off unless you cripple the device by making it ""kid friendly"", or putting it into a state my kids won't even use), but it also requires I shout at it sometimes (in a quiet room) just to get it to register the ""Ziggy"" alternative name they foist upon us.  All in all I would suggest waiting until you can buy devices that are more than convenient amazon shopping tools."	3	April 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is a great device if you want to control things without having to use your full attention and such. I can control whether my smart lights are on or off, what color they are, and the brightness, all from a quick voice command. I can stream my Spotify music to it and control volume and skips through voice commands as well. Timers and alarms are loud and useful. The only problems I have with this device, is the lack of useful skills, shotty voice recognition, and an awful app. The app is laggy, unstable, and sometimes doesn't save things you change. There is no really good skills to download for it either, limiting it's capabilities. I wish they had options for different voices, especially different personalities. I am tired of my Echo sounding like she's dead inside. At the end of the day, extremely worth the price and a good buy, especially for a home with smart devices.	3	November 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I bought this on black friday, because my 2nd gen dot was getting old and worn out.From what I can tell, they have expanded the frequency response to the detriment of clarity and quality. The bass is more noticable but not in a good way, the lower register of voice also sounds a lot more muffled.Oddly, this lack of clarity also seems to follow through to my bluetooth speaker, very noticable lack of sound quality when compared to the gen 2 dot on the same speaker. It sounds like one of those cheap boomboxes with the ""super bass"" turned on. And, no, there are no eq adjustments made, all are on-center.So, I've set this one aside for non-music purposes and reconnected my gen 2 dot for my music listening."	3	January 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Okay so I don't know if this is just mine, but this thing CANNOT hear me half the time no matter where I put it. Aside from that, when it does hear me, it often hears me incorrectly. I've done the things to teach it my way of speech etc etc. I find myself repeating things so many times and being misheard BADLY so much that I'm in a state of fury when I'm done. Lord knows what my neighbors must think always hearing the crazy lady arguing with her robot speaker. Yeah. So anyhow. That's a problem.	3	April 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	We have 11 Alexa units in our hous of various kinds. The whole house audio with multi room setup works for about 2 songs and turns off. Many of the devices don't stay connected.I will be going back to a mostly wired setup. These Alexa devices are not reliable enough. Every time I'm excited and trying to show someone, it fails.When 2 are in a stereo pair, it sounds significantly better than 1 and doesn't have many issues.It's the multi room audio that is bad.The Alexa app is always freezing and glitching too! Probably the worst part of this device is the app you need to control it. I haven't used Google home, but am thinking it might work better.We have all the Alexa devices. They all have the same connection loss and multi room audio issues.Very very dissatisfied with the app.You can't play music you like. Your almost forced to pay for Amazon music.There are so many work arounds to getting different things to play, but none are flawless.If I could start over, I would not go with Alexa devices because of the connection issues, and especially the app!	2	April 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I purchased this 3rd Gen Echo device to replace an echo ""flex"" dot that wouldn't maintain a consistent blue tooth connection to an awesome HK Onyx speaker I use. At first tried to use the headphone jack (on the 3rd Gen Dot) to connect the speaker (but it didn't work). It does however maintain the BT connection much better. However, when connected via blue-tooth it does not work well in an ""everywhere"" speaker group. I have 5 echo devices, and I link them for whole house music. I informed AMAZON, and they have passed it on to their tech group, but no joy yet. So I use this 3rd Gen dot as a stand alone dot in my kitchen, and when not BT connected it does work in my ""everywhere"" group. In the meantime the 2nd gen dot is Bluetooth connected to the Onyx speaker, and does work with ALL of the speaker/dots in my ""everywhere"" group.  So I got the result I wanted (eventually) but performance wise the 2nd generation dot works better than the 3rd gen dot. Sound quality wise, the 3rd gen dot is a much better speaker than the 2nd gen dot (when used as a stand alone unit)."	3	August 13, 2021	1
Echo Dot	So, I got the two echo dot speakers after a friend gave me their larger echo speaker.  The setup was very easy and Alexa seamlessly integrated with my network, she seems to work well, and I was able to even integrate my Sonos speakers with the network, which is nice.  I now have music in every room in the house.  The problems are:1) There is no full functionality of third-party music services with Alexa.  Have Apple Music and Spotify and Pandora accounts...Apple Music is a paid service, too...but despite having Apple Music set as the default music service in Alexa, she continues to default to Amazon music.  She also refuses to shuffle playlists from any of the music services that allow you to build your own playlists (Spotify and Apple).  You set her to shuffle mode and it just continues to play the playlist in order...and she won‚Äôt load the whole playlist...she only plays about the first 15 songs on a loop.  So, while she works okay, there is still a lot missing with full functionality of third party music services.2) Playing music from the Echo speakers requires separate commands for each room, or she‚Äôll just play on all speakers.3) She won‚Äôt play the same music on both the Echo speakers and the Sonos speakers...while they are linked in that Alexa will control the Sonos speakers, she will not play the same music on all the speakers.  She requires separate commands for both Sonos and Echo speakers.So, while we are enjoying the benefits of having the speakers, and there are many, I really wish the developers would get to the bottom of these third party music service integration issues.	3	January 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	bought this for my bathroom and I have youtube music subscription, but this speaker does not allow you to connect it. So I returned it since its not good for my needs.	3	June 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I've always been wary of this device.  Amazon really wanted me to own a 3rd gen one for .99c.  Great deal for a device that will record every conversation in the area.  It has its uses, but keep the thing on mute as much as possible.  This, unfortunately, makes the Echo less useful.  Maybe you don't need one.	3	May 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The Echo Dot 3 is an attractive, compact device. It's a decent speaker with good, clear sound. Where it falls short is where you need it most. 1) Alexa's voice is WAY TOO LOUD! More often than not I find myself just unplugging at night to avoid the temptation to speak the wake word and have her blurt out at high volume like some drunk girl at a party that's already wound down. As it is dependent on wifi, any command while not connected will prompt a super loud reply, like say volume down while using the bluetooth function to stream shows or music. Same for when it connects to a device. She just yells out the device serial number. I've tried to find ways to quiet her voice level vs music and I just don't see the option anywhere. 2) For it to be a smart speaker that is compatible with smart devices it sure doesn't seem all that smart. It still needs to be manually connected to other devices that A) that are in the same network, B) have Alexa C) Have Alexa under the same account... D) Are streaming Amazon content. Feels like 2008 all over again. The Alexa app is ok but nowhere near as intuitive as it should be. 3) Echo Dot 3 is NOT a portable, speaker as it has no battery. Maybe they're saving that feature for the 4. I've never had a desktop speaker that I couldn't take with me. There are however 3rd party devices available to remedy this. Overall, like I said, decent sound device. As long as you have stable wifi and the patience to constantly adjust the volume and to the situation you should be fine with it.	3	December 31, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I use my Echo Dot 3rd Gen for reminders and forecasts, and occasionally a song, but I otherwise don't expect much from it.In November 2021 an update was pushed into this device, and suddenly it started losing its connection to my WiFi and de-registering itself from my Alexa App. I've tried working with Amazon CS twice, and both times went through the factory reset process, but the device immediately stops working again.The issue seems to be that it just won't hold a connection and is stuck trying to update. If I factory reset the device it works, but then I will ask it something like ""remind me in 30 minutes to eat"" and it will say ""reminders are currently not supported on this device"". If I ask it again it will repeat this, but then after a few tries it will say ""okay, I'll remind you in 30 minutes"". The last reply used to be the only reply it gave when it was still working, but these forced updates broke my Echo Dot and now it doesn't work.The other problem is that if I unplug it or the power goes out, and then power is restored instead of just reconnecting to my network like it used to it gives me this rotating orange light and won't respond at all. If I push the action button it says ‚ÄúUpdating your device. I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs ready.‚ÄùFactory resetting is the only way to fix this, but then the same problems I described start happening again; ‚Äúreminders not supported‚Äù, and then ‚Äúupdating your device‚Äù.This started around the time the update was pushed to this device. The fact that it‚Äôs not working is a consequence of something from Amazon‚Äôs end and not my end. If this cannot be fixed I would like the device exchanged for a working Echo Dot.Amazon literally broke this device's functionality. Until this recent issue My Echo worked well enough for the small number of tasks I used it for. I will try reaching out to them again to see if they are willing to replace what they broke through their OTA updating policy (which their CS told me they cannot roll back despite the problems it has caused). I hope they will be willing to do this, and be more careful about what they are doing with these device updates in the future.When it works it's nifty, but Amazon can make it stop working, and that is a serious design flaw."	1	November 18, 2021	0
Echo Dot	It works...	3	July 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Unbelievable that Amazon ruined prime music trying to force customers to upgrade to Amazon music unlimited for an additional fee on top of the prime membership. Only shuffle mode is available for prime music which just plays random related songs to the album or artist that you have in your library! Also I was using this nightly to loop white noise that was available in prime music and I can no longer access it.  Now I‚Äôm scrambling to find a good replacement white noise device so I can sleep again, it worked great under the old plan. Alexa does have white noise options now but that also requires the additional subscription really amazon? Keep increasing prime membership, charging for Whole Foods delivery and now forcing customers to upgrade to Amazon music! I‚Äôm not buying anymore Amazon devices which I didn‚Äôt have so many. Also Im not going to renew my prime membership. Being a customer for so many years it‚Äôs obvious after becoming a monopoly your now gouging your customers.	1	November 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The product is so-so	3	July 18, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I used to love alexa, but now, they've turned her into that nagging child , tugging on your pant leg perpetually asking, 'are we there yet?'alexa wsa great when all she did, was what you asked her tonow she wants to tell you moooooooorrreee , and annoy the (#&( out of you in the processif you have one of the show varieties, you have a screen in settings that allow you to turn on and off whta kind of content will be displayed on your screen.  Thtas a nice feature, until, you find out thta they turn it ALL back on, when they do a push update.So instead of remembering your settings, like you would expect with a SMART device, it resets all those settings to on.  Which means , after each push update, you have to go around to all your show devices, and start scrolling and turning off all the options it turned back on.seriously?next comes, the by the way feature, which you cannot turn off.  again, seriously????you ask her something , or simply tell her to play music, and now and then you are rewarded with alexa rambling off at the mouth like an annoying child,  oh btw blah blahblahlbhaablabhjust shut the #**** ** already and do what I said.and you cant stop her from doing it.the voice recognition is generally pretty good, but after , what almost a decade, it still struggles with certain words and you sit there acting like a tourist in a foreign country slow speaking words trying to get it to understandalso, if its not connected to the internet, forget EVERYTHING.I have it tied to my philips hue light system.  Now considering these are smart devices,  connected to a home network, they should still be able to talk to each other on that network. but nope, it cant.  when my internet goes down, which it does from time to time,  everything stops.  I want to turn off the lights , forget it, alexa is having trouble communicating.  Well its connected to my home network still!!! i should be able to talk to the hue bridge and turn the lights off. but nope, it cant,  so rather than sleeping with a house full of lights on, I have to get up and go turn them all off.  This should not be a problem with a smart device in 2021.I used to love alexa, now, I hate it.  more directly I hate those in charge of seeing to it that alexa is not something that enriches our daily life, but annoys us to no end.	1	February 6, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"OCTOBER 2021 Update: I've unplugged her a few times, this time maybe indefinitely. Always confused, constant wrong answers, hardly understanding what exactly your question is... Or your commands... Quite frankly, I'm very annoyed with Alexa and unplugged her and about to trash her. Google on my phone is far far more successful... So annoyed lately.So, I wish I could give this a higher review. Here's the problem & after research on the internet many many more people also have this same issue. The volume. Every day the volume lowers itself to an almost inaudible level. You constantly have to tell Alexa to ""turn the volume up"" Sometimes more than once a day, because yes it will Sometimes lower itself whenever it chooses. Also, when you ask her to turn her volume up, like tonight, it turned my TV volume up... 3 times I asked until I got annoyed & had to manually do it on the App... Almost made me want to give it a 1 star. I was trying to Google, since Google seems to most always know what your asking & give the right answer as opposed to Alexa, but anyways I tried to Google a solution. As far as I've found, there is no solution, nothing in the settings to fix the volume issue so your stuck with that annoying issue every single day. Not to mentions Alexa doesn't always get your commands correct, will often confuse questions with commands & vice versa, & often has a difficult time giving you the right answer or Sometimes an off the wall answer to a question you didn't even ask. It's like having another girlfriend, but one that at least doesn't argue back...lol üòÜ Just annoys you...lol. jk jk... Anyways, half the time it sucks & the other half the time I lovs it. I enjoy the sound quality, the option to control devices when it works correctly, & it's many other functions that work a little more than 50% of the time... Amazon... Please make it a little better. The sound control issue, that shouldn't even be an issue in the first place... Thank you. Hope some of you found this useful. Alexa is still, for the most part, worth the buy... But half wondering how Echo Dot is...."	2	March 3, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"It has plenty of Loud but very little Soft and clear!  With just 10 or so volume level settings the adjustment from ""Alexia volume 1"" to ""Alexia volume 2"" is larger than desired.  I do like that I can say ""Alexia light off"" from bed, but nightly mood music volume control could clearly use some re-thinking.  The enhanced versions of this product with supposedly better sound quality are actually worse (louder not better).  I think the designers of this product think we are all deaf, or maybe they want to make us deaf..."	3	March 25, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I would not recommend purchasing this if you‚Äôre looking to listen to music for an extended amount of time. I use this in my shop for music and it stops playing by itself. In an hour I would have to restart music. It will say, ‚ÄúSorry Alexa stop working because there was no recent activity.‚Äù What activity would someone have to do to listen to music? In an 8 hour shift I had to restart the music 7 times. SMH	2	September 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Overall, I like this product. I have many Echos and have bought many more as gifts. I'm not going to talk about all her qualities because everyone else has that covered.Here's my problem. I use this one mainly as an alarm clock and sleep noise machine. Alexa used to work flawlessly for this, but she has become increasingly annoying with attempts to upgrade my services. The sound randomly shuts off in the middle of the night. So first problem is that I have to speak out loud, waking my husband, to get her going again. THEN to make matters so much worse, she launches into a sales pitch. Saying ""stop"" doesn't work. She just keep pitching that upgrade. Sometimes she promises to only make that offer to you one more time, but she lies like a cheap rug. So, in the middle of the night, there I am arguing with Alexa. by the time she starts making ocean sounds again, I'm angry and can't get back to sleep. I guess I'll have to buy an actual sound machine and have two things on my nightstand instead of one. UGH!"	3	August 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I bought a couple for myself when they are on sale for Black Friday. They are kind of cool little tools and I'm honestly not worried that they are ""spying"" on me. I mainly bought them to conveniently play music but I have had some issues with the voice recognition. Regardless of the music service I am using I have this problem, and it seems to be an Alexa voice recognition issue. I believe I speak pretty clearly, and in standard American English, but I can say something like ""Alexa, play the album 'Ruiner' by Alex Noble"" and it will NEVER understand me, no matter how hard I try. It always wants to play something with the word ""Rumor"" in the songname by a random arist, rather than looking through the catalog of the artist I mentioned and finding the closet song, which might be a good way to approach this problem in my opinion. Anyway, this was just an example and it has happened when I have tried to play many different songs and albums.Another issue is the Spotify integration. I was having issues with it and eventually completely de-synced Spotify from all my Alexa devices. According the the app, Spotify is not associated with any of my devices, but for some reason it will still play some content from Spotify. I don't get it at all and if it is user error, it is due to something that was poorly designed, because I'm reasonably smart and can't figure out the error.I'm glad I got the things, and hope this will be improved in time, since all it's knowledge and programming is ""in the cloud."""	3	January 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Music sound is acceptable. Female voice is very muffled.  Male voice much better but not great.Purchased this as a second unit to use at the back end of the house so that the wife and I would be able to hear reminders and timers in either end of the house without worries. It would seem Alexa would be able to ""talk"" to all of the echo devices at the same time. I can understand not being able to stream music to more than one device without paying for it but the Echo devices should be able to do the simple tasks and announce on all the Echos at the same time.Sound quality and lack of simultaneous announces is why I give it only 3 stars."	3	January 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I strangely feel cheated because my echo broke a month after buying it without the warranty. It's bogus and I'm not buying another. After talking to the rep, I was satisfied this was resolved and I'm less mad, but please buy the damn warranty. You'll need it!	3	May 26, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is my second Echo. I have an earlier generation of the  Echo Dots, so this is a comparison to that one. The sound of music is much better. However, the microphone seems worse. It will hear its call sign,  but then it only waits about 0.0005 seconds for a command before it stops listening.  It's like the chime  that it heard me is also the buzzer that my time to speak is done.  I frequently have to give one word commands to activate and command it (Alexaweather, Alexaturnoffalarm) even with the adaptive listening function turned on.  It drags the total review down because I'm changing the way I interact with a device that is typically very intuitive.	3	January 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"From a quality perspective, you cannot beat the sound and the manufacturing quality.  From a technology perspective, I think the technology is cool, but I remain concerned on privacy issues.  What is ""Alexa"" listening to in lurk mode?  How do I know what ""Alexa"" is recording or not recording?  I remain frustrated that around the 90 minute mark when listening to Pandora thru the Dot, the music shuts off arbitrarily.  I am not a big fan of only having two different voices for ""Alexa.""For these reasons and more, I don't know!"	3	March 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I've used my Google Home speaker for a couple of years and decided to get an Amazon Dot for another room. It was easier to set-up than than the Google one, but the sound quality was not as clear. For the most part, it is very responsive and gives good information. However, it provides the wrong location for weather when I ask for my schedule. I've gone through every setting possible to fix it, reset, reconnected, uninstalled, reinstalled, but it remains wrong. I've scoured the internet and found this to be a common problem with others, even trying every hint for correction that a few others used. This is very disappointing and makes it about 60% useful to me as compared to its rival product.	3	January 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I used to think Echos were a neat gadget, now I hate trying to use any version we have. All are junk.The Echo takes forever to respond when you call it.You can't play any song, since everything decent is locked in the paid music service. But don't worry, Alexa will tell you about it for five minutes every time you ask for a song. Then after the sales pitch, she will try to shuffle songs that are supposed to similar to your request... Of course they actually aren't close.Don't bother asking any kind of question, Alexa ain't no Google or Seri. Alexa is the dumb cousin who can't even get a passing grade for study hall.They sound like cheap junk. This used to be something one could look past, since we were able to actually listen to the songs we wanted back in the day.I've grown to hate these devices. You will too.	1	November 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"After 1.5 years of use, the best way to describe my experience with echo products is ""annoying"".I own 8 echo dots, a Fire TV, an echo plus, 2 echo studios, and an echo sub that I have placed throughout the house, to use as distributed speakers for playing music. Alexa controls allow for speaker pairs, home theater, room groups and multi-room groups, so everything would be great, right?!Well, except for the fact that the devices lose proper connection to the network for these complex setups - if you want to get it working again, you just have to go through the reset process. Except I bought in, and trying to reset all these devices every week or every few days is an abominable, endless chore.So I tell my speakers to play a podcast from the bedroom group, and the device acknowledges, and nothing happens. So I ask to play from the home theater group, acknowledgment, and nothing.I've tried upgrading the router, bought a second router to act as a repeater, and it's just not getting results. Believe me when I tell you that I've spent nearly as much time talking to Amazon support as I have my own family this past year.I would note that Amazon support has been very helpful through the app, but the app itself is abysmal, slow, and riddled with bugs that constantly tell me new echo devices have been discovered on my network.If this stuff worked, it would be amazing. But it doesn't. 1/3rd of the time, things are fine. 1/3 of the time, I'm listening to music and small weird glitches cause sound artifacts and small delays that make the songs choppy. The other 1/3rd, the devices just don't play music when or where I tell them to.At this point I can't even feel okay with selling these off to some sucker. I just want them to play music when and where they're asked, and play audio from my TV. Will they ever work? Only time will tell."	2	May 1, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"Great little smart device with a woman name Alexa inside a machine. I was watching someone's video in the comments here showing the smart light function demonstration (alexa turn on the light) and even my echo dot sitting at the corner in my room woke up to pick up what that person said in the video and told me ""Sorry I didn't find a device name light"". The only problem I ran into was drop in call sometimes doesn't work. Some restarting may resolve this bug but I hope it's not repetitive. I ain't not time to unplug my echo dot every time this happens. Sometimes when music is playing at 3/4 volume, Alexa won't hear me unless I yell at the top of my lung for it to wake. Overall it's an impressive small smart device. I can't wait to try out the smart plug and dimmable color bulb. We just need more Alexa controlled smart device like ""Alexa, flush the toilet"" without having to press down that filthy flush lever or ""Alexa, open the window blinds in the kitchen"" operating the blinds with a motorized device installed at the main headrail. I can go on but that's just giving free ideas to Amazon. I just love being creative. That's what I do, I drink and I know things.Update 10/31/19: There is a loud high pitch squeal  noise coming out of the echo dot when I drop in call from my Alexa app thru my android phone. Making it unbearable to communicate with someone with they drop in call me. Its horrible! 1 star taken away til they somehow fix this or I will just return it."	3	October 31, 2019	1

Echo Dot	This device was very useful and entertaining. We connected our smart lights, and home thermostat to it so it was convenience to be able to turn on our lights hand free. Voice recognition is not always on point. HOWEVER, we have it for a year now and it seems like Alexa is getting worst. We have to repeat ourselves several times for her to recognize a command. Only a year old!!! Not sure if Bezo had anything to do with her sudden and quick decline. I wouldn't be surprised if he had his team programmed their products to stop functioning after a certain amount of time.	3	January 31, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"Had a horrible time trying to connect with my wifi. Was told by an Amazon specialist I had 32 devices connected to my wifi & insisted I purchase a firewall for 99.00. My internet provider assured me this was not true, did NOT purchase a firewall, I continued to keep trying, and finally succeeded to connect after many attempt for several days. This experience opened my eyes about trusting ""specialists"" in the future."	3	April 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Using an Android Samsung Galaxy 7 Prime I could not set-up an Echo Dot 3 with the Amazon App after previously setting up both an Echo Dot 3 and Smart Plug a few minutes prior. I called Amazon support and they could not fix the problem so advised they would send out a different unit and to return the old unit. I promptly receive the new Echo Dot 3 and had the same problem. I then downloaded the Amazon app to my iPhone and it worked - Set-up complete. I then tried it on the other Echo Dot 3 and after two tries using the app on the iPhone set-up was complete.I will keep the unit and ""not return"" it to Amazon. I have not seen another medium to advise Amazon of this other than this.I just thought it was strange that the app work better on the iPhone versus the Android Samsung phone. Still having a problem downloading Contacts to the Echo device so I can make voice calls by name.Bottom line is that I like the product but did not like the problems with the set-up process and difficulty in downloading Contacts so I can use the Echo as a speakerphone. The app also froze several times forcing be to reboot the phone and this was common on my IOS and Android phones. For these reasons and all the time spent working on fixes and researching the How-To for the device, I can only give this product three stars. This is suppose to make life easier, not take hours to set-up. Still working on some issue like Contacts."	3	November 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The devise it‚Äôs ok for it to fully work as they promote in TV you have to buy extra services to make it fictional. For music display you have to buy an extra Amazon music package for it to give u all the music you want .	3	May 18, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I'm not sure if this is Pandora's fault, or Amazon's fault, but integration with Pandora is very poor. We mainly use this as a smart music device that also tells time and weather. Everything worked well when we had Amazon's unlimited echo streaming plan, and it normally picked the correct music, but canceled when we got a newer echo (this one) and someone in our household signed up for Pandora with family sharing. Since then, the experience has been mostly poor. Alexa rarely matches against the correct music (that I know exists on Pandora), and quite often plays offensive music, which is not good when it's mostly for my kids. For example, if you ask Alexa to play the Frozen II soundtrack (for the kids), it plays some random trash. Worse, I asked Alexa to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"" for my daughter, and it keeps trying to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snow Dick"".  This last part likely isn't AMZ's fault, but Pandora doesn't have a cast to Alexa option anymore, so there's no way to get at the music that you actually want it to play without using the Echo as a bluetooth speaker... less than ideal... Alexa should just work regardless of service.I'm a big music fan, so I have hundreds of my albums uploaded to Google Music (Amazon's music locker service is long gone)... but unfortunately those are not available on my echo, because Amazon doesn't allow Google Music on their devices. Maybe they will add this one day, as they did with YouTube TV on the Fire devices."	3	December 28, 2019	1
Echo Dot	So I got this with a tv I purchased and was super excited because I‚Äôve been wanting an echo and needed one for the smart bulb and plug I had purchased via Amazon. Setup is very simple once app is downloaded. The issue for me is keeping the device connected. It took about a day for the device to stay connected and even then I‚Äôve had for a week at this point it is still disconnecting. Other than that I love it. It‚Äôs loud, it connected to my smart bulb fine (but that disconnects too once Echo disconnects). I‚Äôm hoping it gets better. I chose this over Google (which my son has and never had issues with).	3	December 30, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Got this to replace a 1st Gen dot and while the standalone sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity are significantly better, it is frustrating. My family often gets impatient with this unit because it frequently has multi-second delay after you say the wake word‚Äìand about a third of the time, it takes 3+ tries to get it to wake.Another minor annoyance: it has its own special power cord. The previous version used USB and you could plug it into a hub or multi-port 120V charger. Now you have to use a dedicated 120V plug‚Äìmaybe it's Amazon's way of selling more power strips??	3	February 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	For the most part Alexa is a superior external speaker for my tablets. It does play the music I enjoy.  Its good for updates on weather and national news. Alexa doesnt do well with requests for local news  I have to ask  multiple times to get it to read an audio book and its slow to learn my speach patterns and the time allowed to ask questions  is too short.as this was a gift I am inclined to overlook much of the inconvenience . I am  however getting frustrated with many of the claims for what it can do and it doesn't.	3	January 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"This was my second Echo Dot so ,obviously I like them, but when I went to set it up I had issues it wouldn't connect to the internet. After going to the Amazon troubleshooting site, and trying everything there. I decided to use the pop up virtual assistant. I was then connected to a ""tech"" by phone which they asked for my number. After being reassured he would fix the issue and have it running by the time the call ended, he remoted into my computer, said I had all these issues installed a network security program which ""protected the network and everything on it"" he asked for $500.00. when I told him I didn't have the money he hung up on me. I got suspicious and deleted the program he installed, scanned my system with my security and did the cleanups I know about. Two days later I got 8 calls about fraudulent charges on my amazon account. I really got nervous because I never gave him any of my account numbers at all. So I called Amazon to inquire about the charges they reassured me my account was fine, I explained what happened and they said they would never ask to remote into someones computer and I needed to change all my passwords. They logged the numbers I got calls from and said they would look into this. I then called my internet service to change the password and was told I should bring my computer into an IT person just in case something was installed I didn't know about. I just got my computer back and they did fine suspicious programs on my system. so much for a great Prime day deal of 20 it ended up costing me $150.:( And I still couldn't get the dot to connect, finally I had to use my phone, which I don't like doing. The Alexa app for PC id useless."	2	July 6, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"Setup was a breeze.  Got it online, started to link some of my home automation accounts...etc.  A couple of issues I have had was the ""EVERYWHERE Speaker.""  According to details, you can link all or specific echos in x-room so they all play music. So in essence, you can walk through your home and everyroom that has an echo, will be playing the music you had launched from room 1.  After looking through documents etc, I still can't figure it out.  Previous posts have said this is a bug in the software.  My echo gen1 worked fine.Second thing I've noticed, I have FireTVs linked.  I can't control them via voice. Prime example is - Alexa, turn off Diningroom TV.  Response:  Did you mean Livingroom TV?  Again -- not sure what the issue is:  I can control the same tv via wifi, with my phone.Little things like this have been irratating.  Apparently my google-foo is failing as well.  I'm not able to find info on the topic, but it would be great if this was a bug, if it was actually fixed.  OR if there is a FAQ or knowledge article on it, it would be awesome if the online help would help."	2	January 11, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I was given/bought this as a gift and even though I set it up with my Amazon account it is still paired with the account that ordered it as a gift for me so I get notifications from both accounts.Also when I paired the device with my Amazon five TV it only used the echo dot speaker and not the TV or auxiliary speakers which drastically reduced the sound so I had to disconnect the echo dot from the fire tv.It is basically a glorified light switch (when you buy the plugs that pair with it)  and a weathered and news station.	3	January 16, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Over a period of several months, I attempted to set up this item but it would not connect to the internet. I have two other Echo devices that are connected with no problem.  The return policy button on my invoice states it can be replaced through April 2023.  I tried to replace it but was directed to chat with an Amazon representative.  I spent almost 2 hours with a half a dozen different people in chat and no one could get it set up and they refused to replace it.  I sent them a screenshot that stated it could be replaced through April 2023 but they said it only applies to unopened items with the replacement for open items being 90 days and not a year.  Of course the return policy button doesn‚Äôt state that.  They also said they couldn‚Äôt replace it because it wasn‚Äôt registered.  I explained that it needed to be connected to Wi-Fi to register and since it won‚Äôt connect, can‚Äôt register.  They said I could trade it in and get a refund of the current value, but a $5 refund on a $30 item didn‚Äôt appeal to me.  With all of the purchases I make on Amazon, it seems like a bad business practice to harass me so much on a $30 item.  Guess I am just out my $30.	1	August 23, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I have a Gen 2 Alexa and have really enjoyed it.  When the Gen 3's went on sail about a month ago I ordered one and got a free light bulb to boot.It took over a month for the the Gen 3 to arrive (the bulb came in a few days).  I am not sure why it took so long.I set it up and was VERY disappointed in the sound. I am not a sound techy person and didn't have a problem with the sound of the Gen 2.  Yes it is a little tinny and music has almost no bass so I was expecting an improvement in the Gen 3.  Not only is there no improvement but it is actually worse.  It sounds like it is stuffed in a sock or something.  The sound is very muffled.  I went to the EQ and took out all of the bass, almost all of the midrange and pushed treble as high as it would go.  It is some better but still not right.  I can not imagine why they would have killed the sound this way. If they weren't going to improve it they could have left it alone.  With the new look they still could have sold it as a new version.	3	December 22, 2020	1

Echo Dot	This thing makes me sooooo angry!!!!!!!!! I bought it to use mainly as a white noise machine for my baby, figured I‚Äôd buy this instead of a white noise machine since it can play music + has other features. This thing is so damn stupid. It never plays the correct sound (even tho I repeat it verbatim) it makes random noises in the middle of the day. It‚Äôll be 3am as I‚Äôm breast feeding and I need the audio to play and she‚Äôll choose that time to tell me a 15 second long story about purchasing some BS.. hence waking up my baby and making me very angry. If I hadn‚Äôt thrown out the box I would return this. The biggest waste of money!!!!! Beware as it will make you pull your hair out and throw it against the wall. Don‚Äôt purchase if you plan to use it for your baby‚Äôs room.	1	November 4, 2022	0

Echo Dot	"Sound quality muffled, like talking thru a sock.  Alexa learned my voice but heard a command from a YouTube I was watching and responded to it (the guy had a higher voice and accent.. That's not me). It also takes time for a response, more than Google. Also, I couldn't get it to shut up.  Alexa tried to sign me up for Amazon music unlimited several times, I had to unplug. Very frustrating.Update: the response gets better as you use it. Still can't do multiple questions like Google Nest. I did use the drop in feature after which I accidentally called myself now I have received 20 calls in 8hrs from numbers similar to mine with VM from ""Amazon"" saying someone has accessed my account.  These are spoof calls. Completely annoying.If you are an ""Alexa"" type Echo would be a fit but get the 4rth Gen.  If you like more informative information, or a Google person... It's not for you.An example.

Echo Dot	"I'm going with 2 stars because when it is working, the dot is super convenient. I love being able to just ask what the weather is going to be that day or ask how long it's going to take me to get somewhere. However, every single echo dot that I have owned has stopped being able to ""hear"" me, or just has stopped responding to my questions after about a year and a half. I don't know if it's the fact that it stays plugged in all the time, or if it's just not meant to last for more than a year or so? It's just very frustrating and disappointing. I shouldn't have to replace something every year or two. I rely on my echo dot as an alarm clock so when my alarm goes off earlier than my husband has to get up and for whatever reason all of the sudden Alexa can't hear me anymore, it just keeps going and going and going and I have to get up to unplug the entire dot to get out to stop. I am very frustrated by this and will be switching to Google home in hopes that it does not have the same issues."	2	January 31, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Numerous small issues.When you set a timer, it's local to that device. So if you set a timer in the kitchen for, say, cookies or something, then go to another room, that timer will only go off in the kitchen even if you have an echo dot by your computer.The app is annoying; it needs a ""duplicate routine"" option for if you need to make multiple similar routines. For example, if you make a routine for ""I'm in the den"" which turns off all the lights except the ones in the den, and then you want to make an ""I'm in the living room,"" you can't just copy and edit the first one. You have to set it up from scratch, which in my apartment means setting six individual lights to off and one on. Each of those is selected from a menu, then you set options in sub menus, so something that should take less then a minute ends up taking up to ten. Plus if you accidentally hit ""back"" it drops all progress and starts over. And there's no option to create routines on PC in a browser where it would be more convenient.The echo dot often doesn't understand what I say. Sometimes I have to repeat commands up to three times.Alexa never shuffles playlists when I ask her to play music, which is only a minor annoyance but it's still annoying.There's a ton of potential for this to be awesome in the next generation, but for now it's just okay. The device itself would get another star if the app was better."	3	October 9, 2019	1

It won't acknowledged me unless I tell ALEXA!!! and then scream commands at it, which it usually ignores. One night I was hollering at alexa trying to get it to turn off my fan and turn on the bathroom light. It wouldn't acknowledge me so I kept having to yell and yell. my neighbor called the cops because she thought there was a domestic dispute. I had to demonstrate to the officers. Of course alexa listened and obeyed immediately. I had to let them search my property to convince them I lived alone. I was MORTIFIED. I don't know why I keep this little brat around.	2	July 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The product had amazing sound but would not play more then a few songs and shut off.  I have an Echo Dot 2 and they would not connect.  I can ask my echo dot 2 to play the rolling stones and it will literally play for days.  I would ask the echo dot 3 and it was a crap shoot.  I have the echo dots to play  music 24 hours a day.  I have 2 little dogs and I have found if I play music all the time they are more calm as the outside noises of apartment living are kept at a minimum.  The echo dot would not perform in that manner.  I tried to connect the two of them and it looked good on the ipad but they never connected to play the same music thru out the apt.  I would come home and the echo 3 would be off and I would have a panicked dog.  Not cool.  Amazon Sent me a new echo dot 3 and it lasted for maybe 2 months... the speakers sounded blown.  Amazon sent me a return label...  Since I love my echo dot 2 I have ordered an echo show 5 and I am praying I love it!!  I have had more good luck with amazon products then bad so I am willing to continue using their products.  They did refund me for the echo dot 3!  Thank You Amazon for standing behind your products!!	3	December 16, 2019	1
Echo Dot	My Echo Dot was a kind gift replacement for a bedside radio alarm, including some lists and reminders provided by the giver.  My house appliances are not electronically automated (I still know how to turn switches on and off), I don't use other voice activated aids nor do I remember command key words readily (so if I say the wrong key word, Alexa has no idea what I want, leaving me to scratch my muddled brain about appropriate synonyms), and I feel it's kind of creepy talking to a dumb computer voice which hasn't been adequately programed to search for my music or queries. Nor is the cell phone app very helpful for finding how to use features which I haven't yet realized that I might not need. Nor is the Amazon Prime Music library very complete, for the kind of classical and jazz music that I like without paying another monthly fee (Pandora - if I could attach to it -  provides a much broader Station association between my song and others I might thumbs up). But it is nice to be reminded to take my nighttime pills or to have Dot tune in to my favorite on-line radio station when I say 'Alexa, Good Morning,' with great sound quality, as long as she hasn't changed the volume to blast me out of the room since the last time.	3	August 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	My 9 year old received this as a gift. After setting up free time and subscribing to kindle unlimited we set it up using his preexisting kindle profile. Alexa works with specific commands which doesn‚Äôt seem like a problem at the time but when she only recognizes your voice 25% of the time it‚Äôs a bit of a pain. All 3 members of my household have different accents coast to coast and no luck with echo dot. On top of that she doesn‚Äôt recognize the names of a lot of the 3rd party apps for kids. Setting the up routines was a long glitchy process and the math app was not great. Overall it does preform its basic functions which is why I gave it 2 stars. Nothing puts a parent in a great mood like yelling ‚ÄúRead Harry Potter!‚Äù 7 times and hearing ‚ÄúReading Peter Rabbit by Beatrice Potter.‚Äù Eventually even the most patient child begins to hate Peter Rabbit all because of Alexa.  After yelling the name of your book 5 times eventually she might get it and if not you can use the phone app.Pros: Can remind kids of chores and will play audiobooks if you open them from your phone.When we were picking out smart speakers for the rest of our home we decided to try Google Home Mini and wow what a difference. Google Home can recognize conversational commands, help kids with math problems, has exceptionally clearer sound in addition to both voice and touch volume controls. So far the only con is figuring out how to edit actions in the middle of the night without google responding verbally. Google will even tell you Alexa has her strengths and Google has hers when you ask who Alexa is. It‚Äôs not linked directly to audible but you can play it using the Bluetooth function. It also connects to our smart tv. The only advantage Echo Dot has is a direct connection to order on amazon or audible but given that Alexa opens the wrong book 75% of the time I can only imagine the problems with orders. Our kiddo is jealous and now wants a Google Home mini too.	2	May 26, 2020	0

Echo Dot	There are many things I love about having an Alexa.  If my family is only listening to music on one device it's totally fine, but I wanted something that I could have one song in one room and another on in another room. I thought it was supposed to be able to do that,  it's why I bought it.  Now it just causes trouble with my kids fighting over who gets to listen to music each night.  üò†	3	February 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Either my alexa has a bad microphone or something because I have to yell at it several times, talk insanely slow and clear which I already do but it seems to only works when it wants to. I want to upgrade to see if the new ones are any better but this is very off putting I been owning it for a few years and it's a pain in the ass.	2	August 28, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I've enjoyed my Alexa and this, the Dot, since setting them up about 6 months ago.  They are pretty easy to set up, voice commands to play songs and adjust the volume work well most of the time, and the sound quality even on the Dot is pretty good.  Plus I can play songs directly from my Amazon Music library.  All good, right? Well, sort of...The thing I DON'T like is that if my wife is playing songs from Amazon Music on her phone or anywhere else, and I ask Alexa to play a song, I can't do it unless I want to pay the $14.99/month unlimited family plan streaming fee.  I understand that Amazon needs to make money, but I already pay $99 per year for Amazon Prime and I buy over half my stuff on Amazon.  Now they want 15 bucks a month just so my wife and I can both enjoy music at the same time?  This is an example of the big guy on the block wanting ALL the money.  I'm annoyed every time I can't play a song.  So If you're the only one streaming music on Alexa, or if you don't mind shelling out another $14.99 per month, then I would recommend Alexa and Alexa Dot.	3	October 10, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"We bought this to replace our Google mini that died due to a widespread glitch in a Google update. Our Alexa Dot seems sturdier than the mini- hopefully it will last longer? That said, it's much harder to use. It was a real pain to set up ( how we'll ever remotely be able to direct nursing home staff to set up Mom's replacement for her Google mini, I have no idea! She relied on her mini to wake her up, tell her weather and answer a myriad of questions she has). The dot is more finicky about asking for stuff in exact words- getting it to open my favorite radio station takes some tongue-twisting. It requires a lot of ""skills"" to be downloaded from the app ( like a separate skill for each separate radio station or background sound you want) in order to more easily recognize your request- each skill an app that you have to search out and download. Also, Alexa's sense of humor is TERRIBLE! ( we loved asking funny stuff of our Google mini. Maybe this will get better as Alexa ""gets to know us""?) The responses have been beyond flat with the Dot. Hopefully a lot of this is just a slow learning curve, but we shall see. Definitely not as intuitive as the Google mini, that's for sure!"	3	September 2, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Just sounds terrible over the speaker, hard to hear and sounds cheap. I feel if I‚Äôm Trading my soul and privacy to Amazon, and paying for it, they should give a humble peasant decent sound quality.	3	May 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I bought this because it was a good deal and I haven't tried ""Alexa"" before just Google. I found her to be great at hearing your voice but for answering simple questions, not great. I like the fact that it's hooked up to Amazon because I do a lot of shopping there. I will continue to use Alexa for my Amazon music and stuff. I would still recommend it!"	3	March 15, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Sonds better that the original one I had that wouldn't connect to the internet so I threw it as far as I could after being on the phone with Amazon technical support for over an hour.

Echo Dot	Glad it was free with a Sirius xm renewal. Easy to set up and it is convenient to use but it will not after 3 hrs on phone with product support recognize or control Philip's hue lamps. Turns out this had to do with the broadcast frequency of my wifi and what frequency the hue and the echo will work on. Been so long now I forget the exact details but it is unacceptable that Alexa tech support could not figure this out. I sent the hues back. Got alexa plugs and while hard to set up and get them all in the same group, they work well.  After living with Alexa for a few years now, my opinion is that it is needlessly complicated because of trying to be everything to everyone. Too many ways to do the same thing when just one way would be fine. And why would anyone want the thing chiming or glowing in the middle of the night because the status of an amazon order changed and it does the same thing if you set a routine. Totally aggrevating and totally unnecessary.  The best thing I have found that this thing is good for is along with the plug modules, I can turn on a light in every room of my house with a single voice command from my bedroom.  This is why I bought it and the plugs. Other than that, I could do without it.	3	February 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	UPDATE:So it would seem that echo dot is less user friendly than my initial impression.- If you are 5ft+ away from it, or if there is any other sounds in the room, or if there is any obstacle between you and the dot, it starts to not hear you or misidentify your command even when you already raised your voice. The further away you are the worse this gets.- I cannot get it to stop blinking yellow notification. I've read multiple sites on how people turn off notification for tip of day, mail, etc. but it still blinks and gives me that tip of day crap. It should've be a very simple configuration and it should work the way I want it, not having me looking up sites after sites for configuration for a simple option maybe just because amazon wants to showcase their featureBecause my sole purpose of getting it is just to give me accurate voice command capability of lights/electronics around the house and not give me unsolicited information. I'll say it around 2.5 star for me at this time.----------------------------------Overall setup is very simple for someone who is somewhat familiar with technologies and can follow instructions.The dot is smaller than I remembered but has surprisingly good sound quality for such small device. It is very nice looking imo and can recognize my command very well. It does sometimes have trouble picking up my voice about 10+ ft away in my fairly opened living room/kitchen/dining room area, I'll have to test this further as it was quite noisy in the room at the time.I also have non-amazon brand smart switches setup and the Alexa app was able to pick it up. I was very impressed because it asked me which room the light switch was at and setup the light switch all by itself without any manual intervention on my part.I got the three-dot deal and one of the box seem to have been opened previously because the seal sticker on the box has been teared off, however the inner plastic wrapping seems intact. As the dot seem to be functioning flawlessly and it seems too big a hassle to return it, I am just going to keep it but just throwing this out there for whoever might care - check your factory seal.I am actually in the process of recommending a smart home system to an elderly relative who would prefer foreign language voice command. I think this might be a feature where amazon falls short of but otherwise I am perfectly happy with this system.	2	November 30, 2019	0

Echo Dot	One of my other ones, a year old, died so I ordered this one to replace it.  This one is definitely diff from my older version ones.  This one, in a room downstairs, would respond to my commands instead of the one a few feet away from me in the same room upstairs.  So I switched those two.  I commented on the difference and then I believe it made some adjustments because it asked me a few times after that if the correct echo dot responded.This one has a more bass tuned voice and I don't like it as well as the way my previous ones sound.  It is less clear. I think it is probably to give music a better sound if you use it to play through its builtin speaker but I don't.  I have BT speakers for music.  I haven't checked to see if you can alter the bass/treble.This one has a cloth wrap on it and a bit rounder shape, I don't really care about that, I thought the other ones were fine and probably would stay cleaner or at least be easier to clean since they are all hard plastic.  Not that I've actually cleaned any of them lol.  Anyhow it provides the same functionality for me and that is what I wanted.	3	June 1, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I mostly use it for music and I get it, it‚Äôs Amazon not apple so it probably doesn‚Äôt completely support Apple Music but it says it does so I feel like it should. I‚Äôm not paying for two music streaming services, it‚Äôs so frustrating when I ask her to play my music and she‚Äôll say ‚Äúplaying elyssas music from Apple Music‚Äù and probably 10% of the music she plays is actually in my playlist. If I wanted to listen to random music I would select a genre. No I want to listen to songs I know the lyrics to and know I like. ‚ÄúYour feedback is saved‚Äù no it isn‚Äôt you play the same songs over and over no matter how many times I thumbs down. I lost it before I posted this because I told her ‚Äúskip‚Äù about ten times and every song she played wasn‚Äôt in my playlist and it was songs I knew and hated. I have like one Kendrick song so she‚Äôs always trying to play him even tho I have ONE song that he FEATURES In, it‚Äôs not even his song and she‚Äôs always playing him and I ALWAYS thumbs him down cos I don‚Äôt like his voice at all. I always lose my patience and just tell it to shut up cos I‚Äôm not in the mood to listen to music after saying skip/thumbs down 20 times in a row.	2	October 23, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The device itself works as intended. I use it mostly as a speaker for my music and its great. What irritates me is if I gotta change the WiFi, it will stay stuck on setup mode and I‚Äôve done everything everybody recommends to reassure the device can connect.	2	September 17, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I purchased three of these during Prime Days.  First, it took FOREVER for me to receive them, and I still have not received one of the three ordered.Secondly, the only music platform that seems to work correctly is Amazon music.  On any other platform, the song gets about a quarter of the way to halfway finished and it cuts out to dead air.  When the music resumes, a new song is playing.  I listen to pandora primarily, then apple music and Amazon as my last option.  I purchased them to add easily accessible music in my office, gym, and yoga room.  I contacted amazon and did troubleshooting with no resolution.  They sent me two replacements that are doing the same thing.  The funny thing is if I listen to my second-generation dots and plus I have no issues with any of my music platforms.  It is only the third-generation with the problem; which tells me there is something wrong with this third-generation.  I hope they will take this back and return my money.  I would rather have a refurbished second-generation than not to be able to listen to all of my music platforms.Thirdly, the echo says it is up to date, BUT the tech support representative stated that the software version is not the latest.Lastly, I have to repeat myself multiple times for this echo to wake up and do what is asked.  In my opinion, Amazon had to throw a bunch together to keep up with demand from Prime Days and manufactured a bunch of defective echo dots.I hardly ever do reviews, but I am so annoyed with this situation that I had to let others know what to expect.  This third-generation is not the high-quality Amazon product you have become accustomed.  Do yourself a favor and wait until a new generation becomes available or buy an old one.	1	August 27, 2019	0

Echo Dot	Not as smart as you would like it to be for sure. What I like the most about smart devices is that they save you time and make things better with easier steps. This wasn't the case here. I got 2 dots and thought to myself I will make a smart surrounding sounds system. It failed miserably. First the Routines on the Alexa app sucks especially when you have more than 1 device. When it connects to your phone, only one device can play the sound for some reason. The 2 devices works only on Amazon music, which I thought is fine, I'm not opposing it but then the app is so laggy. The devices can't follow complex demands. And it can't even save your answer for a question they ask me every day. This is a big fail for me. The sound quality is alright though.	2	May 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It has a tendency to reduce its volume periodically.  My other Alexa Echo does not do this.  Its range from the AT&T modem is remarkable.	3	May 17, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I like music in my environment.  When Google / YouTube went to subscription-only music, I retired my Google Home for Alexa and the Alexa Dot.  I am already paying for Prime, so I might as well enjoy the Amazon Music through Alexa.  I bought this Dot in September, so you know I've given it more than a shot at impressing me.The combination of Amazon Music and Dot/Alexa is inconsistent at best, frustrating at worst.  I can't tell you whether the problem is with Alexa/Dot or Amazon Music, but I usually have no problem with Amazon Music when I play it through my laptop.  The problems? Sometimes I have to ask Alexa twice to play a music station.  The first time she will confirm the station I've requested... then silence.  Nothing.  So I ask again.  And music...  Sometimes I ask to play a station and  the music starts, then stops after one song... or two songs... or ten minutes... or continues to play (my preferred action) until I tell it to stop.  Sometimes I think it's the act of 'asking', so I use my app.  The same inconsistencies.  And frequently an ad pops up on my app asking if I want to pay MORE for Amazon Music.  Really?  I'm auditioning your service everyday.  You're not winning my money.I'm not sure how I'm going to resolve this.  Pay for another music service? Go back to Google Home?  But I wanted to get my frustrations in front of people.  With 4.5 stars after over a million reviews, I think proclaiming my disappointed in this product will make little difference.  Amazon.  Are you listening?  Something is wrong with this.	2	February 24, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"I have mixed feelings about the Echo Dot.  I do like the convenience it has with just speaking a command to the Dot.  I also like the portability of just plugging it in anywhere, as long as you have wi-fi. .We use it for music 95% of the time.  On the down side ,it gets confused about certain playlists we try to activate.  About 50% of the time, it will stop  playing for no reason and when we ask why, we get ""stopped due to inactivity"".  Why do we need to be active with it, it's supposed to be playing music.  This seems to be a common issue with this device per the forums I have read.  As many posts that I have read on this, you would think that Amazon would have this issue resolved by now.  Some of the posts I read are dated over a year ago.  At the end of the day, I would have to say the Echo Dot is just an ""OK"" device.  The negatives take away from the positives.  I doubt I would ever purchase another one."	3	March 23, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I had a google home and tried to change over to the echo dot. It's just not as smart or as capable as google home.

Sound is decent though.	3	March 4, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Makes signing into xbox live a 2step process instead of one. It's easier to just use the remote because you have to grab it anyway to put in your security code.

Echo Dot	Got this on a Prime Day bundle with a LIFX smart bulb. Therein lies the problem. Overall, Alexa seems to work well most of the time. But I have two issues with the Echo Dot/Alexa.First is the voice quality. When Alexa speaks it's very muddy. If there's any background noise it's very difficult to understand her. Surprisingly though, when I play music through the Echo Dot it sounds remarkably good. Much better than I anticipated from a speaker so small. IMO, better than the Google (Nest) Home Mini.Second is the integration with the LIFX bulb. Often Alexa will respond that the bulb cannot be located. Then some random number of days pass and she will suddenly see the bulb again. Then 1-3 days later, she looses it again. Very frustrating considering Amazon chose to bundle this bulb with the Echo and it's so unreliable. When she can't find it, Google Assistant and Homekit both have no trouble at all.On the plus side, integration with Amazon services is great. And she's been extremely reliable interfacing with my Sonos One SL speaker. I can ask for any music on Sirius/XM, Apple Music or Amazon Music and she always comes through!	3	December 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This speaker is ok, it‚Äôs not what I thought it was and maybe that‚Äôs my fault because I assumed instead of reading. The speakers volume is ok but if your having a party or something this is definitely not the speaker for that and the speaker has to be plugged up I thought it was Bluetooth and can just be charged but no. Which is surprising but it was only $20 so you get what you pay for. The price makes sense.	3	January 24, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"Alexa is limited as to what she can tell you and gives up after one try. Frustrating when trying to get information, and she will keep going to the same website. She definitely won't replace a computer for research. Alexa can also be wordy / annoying when trying to help - having to interrupt her to say stop. Amazon music is overall disappointing as the same genre songs are played over and over - you wind up specifying songs and artists. ""Play more like this"" gives you one extra song by the artist - then Alexa plays the same old repertoire ad nausium. Not every song you can think of is available, and Alexa will pick the latest artist if the song is a remake - annoying when you want to hear the original (or don't know the artist of the original song.) Another person with another account lives with me, and their Echo 3 dot plays song through mine, even though they are on separate accounts and in different rooms and not within earshot of the other (how does that happen?) You wind up unplugging Alexa to avoid unwanted music. Pluses are the great sound quality - Alexa's ability to understand you and respond from a distance. Annoyances aside - I'll think I'll keep her!"	3	July 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"First off - I love my Alexa and I've gone all in on these things.  We have the big Echo in the kitchen and a dot in all three bedrooms (with another one in the garage attached to one of those chargers that lets me take it outside wirelessly).What infuriates me is that I pay fifteen bucks a month for a family plan so that my son can listen to Old Town Road on a loop in one room, my daughter can sing along with Elsa in her room, and my wife and I can rock out to Deer Tick downstairs.  That's the American dream, right?But it's JUST a dream.  If you tell the dot in my son's room to play sleep sounds, it turns off Nora Jones Radio downstairs and starts playing Ocean Waves there instead of in his room.  I've tried naming the device with the Alexa app and saying ""Play Rain Forest Sounds in Jackson's Room"" but it will inevitably turn OFF the Little Mermaid soundtrack in my daughter's room and play it in there anyway - causing her to get out of bed and complain when I just want them to go to sleep.I figured out a delicate order that will bring balance if I start with the Disney music or audiobook of Harry Potter in her room and THEN tell Alexa to play sounds  in his room with a seemingly endless list of commands (""play rain forest sounds"" ""No, I do not want to pay extra for HD quality forest sounds"" ""enable loop"") but then we're married to sitting in silence downstairs until we go to bed because we don't want to risk changing the noises in their rooms by asking for some Langhorne Slim while we relax on the couch.But of course, if I've got something I'm grooving to during the day downstairs, my son is inevitably going to go into his room and ask for Megadeath (where the HECK did he learn what Megadeath is?! I'm looking at you, Uncle Steve) and, while his room remains quiet, my Frightened Rabbit disappears and it's Symphony of Destruction blasting into my living room.What the heck am I paying for a family plan for?  Maybe I ought to have just one Alexa device that I move from room to room.  When you ask a device to produce some kind of sound, why isn't it THAT device that responds?"	1	September 15, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The Echo Dot refuses to answer incoming calls even though the cell phone is linked to the device..  I spent more than 70 minutes with Amazon device support and she was unable to fix the problem.  There should be a simple Let Alexa Answer Incoming Calls setting but instead, there are a half dozen related settings scattered around.  Regardless, even with all of them set properly it still does not detect the incoming call.  Asking Alexa to answer the call results in a no incoming calls reply.	3	December 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This model is not worth getting. The sound quality is pretty good, and the things you can tell it to do is pretty comprehensive. The only problem is when playing music, she gets hard of hearing. It's like yelling at a teenager because it takes 3 or 4 yells for Alexa to respond :/	3	March 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Alexa doesn't speak Chinese for voice commands, even though Alexa / Echo Dot (Gen 3) can translate English into Chinese when asked, ""Alexa, what's ----- in Chinese?"". If you use this to listen to C-pop: Alexa absolutely CANNOT find songs, playlists, or artists in Chinese. For example, artist 'Shinyen' was pronounced (in English) ""Shuh-NYE-en"". That's 'NYE' as in 'hair-dye'. (rolling eyes emoji) Please add ‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese) as a dual-lanugage option paired with English for the United States. An even better advanced feature would be a Polyglot option with the ability to select one or more primary languages for those of us in a multi-language home. Also: Indigenous Lanugages PLEASE!

Echo Dot	I bought two of these last Christmas since they were cheaper than the normal price, and I am trying hard not to get rid of them. When I ask a simple question, I do not need the Gettysburg Address as a response. Actual example: I asked what time it was. After giving me the time, it proceeded to let me know multiple things that I can ask it that had absolutely nothing to do with the time. Another example: I asked what the date was. After telling me the date, it said 'did you know I can also order cleaning supplies for you? Ask me...'?! I've already done a bunch of online searching and toggled all of the things in the app that my searches told me to turn off, and yet as others have mentioned on message boards, it continues to do it.Was this review helpful?

Echo Dot	I give this device 1 star because it doesn't respect settings set via the Alexa app. Specifically, I use Spotify. When I ask Alexa to play a playlist using this device, it never finds it because it insists on using Amazon Music. I've selected Spotify as the default music service through the Alexa app (note: can't do this on web!), and it still refuses to understand. The end result is any time I ask it to play a playlist on Spotify, it can't because it's looking on Amazon Music - or worse, it plays some random song from Amazon Music that I don't want. It's incredibly frustrating and, consequently, I wouldn't recommend it.The audio quality is pretty good though. It can also get loud. It's just a shame that a device I want to use for playing music can't play music because Amazon can't figure out that I want to use a service other than Amazon Music.	1	October 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I‚Äôve complained on multiple occasions to Alexa phone support only to be told that they will write a trouble ticket and forward to their team ‚Ä¶without ANY resolve!Here‚Äôs the problem, like most of you I have a select amount of Pandora stations which I frequently listen to. Up until 3 months ago I was able to listen to Kap Slap Radio (on Pandora). When I tell Alexa to play that station she instead plays Cap One Radio (which isn‚Äôt worth listening). I used to be able to request that station without a hitch, but something has happened (I‚Äôm guessing during an update).As I mentioned before, Alexa support is useless and does nothing to correct this issue!!!***Update - So a day after posting my review, I recieved a voicemail from someone at Amazon saying that they'd like to speak with me to try and make things better... I called them back right away and it was only a generic Amazon customer service number (so there was no way to get in touch with Timothy).I also received an email stating to reach them back otherwise they won't reach back out to me again. Basically, it was simple formalities for someone leaving a negative review for an Amazon product. Very Disappointing!!!	1	July 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	finally upgraded from the very first alexa tower from years ago (it fell and broke).  must shout commands at it 3-4 times, would vastly prefer the original, this is NOT an improvement AT ALL.  voice recognition extremely spotty, if at all.  it just simply does not respond.  have taken to screamig at it to make it work, which it then intermittently does.	2	August 18, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I've bought Alexa from the 1st generation and on.  What I've noticed,  is that over time even as I upgraded to the newest generation. They improved, but voice recognition sucks. It's too sensitive sometimes and you have to scream at it other times.  I wish I invested in a different product. Sound quality sucks even with the echo.  I have 3 dots and 1 echo.  I get more angry at Alexa every year I have her around.	3	January 11, 2022	1

Echo Dot	If Alexa is an ‚Äúassistant‚Äù using artificial ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù, then why is it more inconvenient to use and interactions leave me cursing her for being stupid? After two years of using two Echo Dot‚Äôs, I‚Äôve decided these things are really only good for listening to music (with Amazon Music of course, which is crap) and pretty decent for turning on/off smart lights. But ask her to perform simple routines and you get a lot of ‚Äúhmm, I don‚Äôt know that one.‚Äù She‚Äôs useless! The majority of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù features require me to use the app. Want Alexa to turn on a light at a certain time‚Ä¶ break out the app and program a routine, because asking her to do that is impossible. I have more frustrating arguments with her than intelligent assistance. Bottom line, buy a Bluetooth speaker, use any number of Alexa app alternatives (Apple HomeKit, Google Home, IFTTT, etc. - there are dozens out there) and leave Alexa sitting on the virtual store shelf where she can assist at the only things she‚Äôs good at‚Ä¶ being in the way and collecting dust. Seriously, what good is a virtual assistant that you have to do everything yourself in an app? When Siri is better at being an AI than your product is, you‚Äôve got problems‚Ä¶ Amazon! And I‚Äôm not anti-Amazon in any way. Just telling it like it is. Alexa is basically Phoebe, but ask her to sing Smelly Cat and you‚Äôll likely get ‚Äúhmm, I don‚Äôt know that one.‚Äù	2	August 19, 2021	0
Echo Dot	When this product works, it works very well. Other times it can't understand what you're asking for, and for one suggested topic, it just goes in circles. I'm in a group where we're using Alexa, and we're supposed to get the daily health tip, but instead I get the daily joke; and for the daily aphorism, I get a loop of nonsense. I do like the chair yoga program but it's hard to get Alexa to stop at the end. Although I didn't think of using Alexa to contact Amazon when the wrong product was delivered. That might have been helpful.	3	November 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Sometimes Alexa will announce something about a product it thinks it heard in a conversation or ask if we want more information about it without first been addressed by name. Makes me wonder just how much conversation is being collected by  Mr Bezos for his later listening pleasure or marketing plans.	3	March 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is fine for keeping track of what I need from the store, but a few months ago, the TuneIn feature became, to my deep dismay, ubiquitous. I bought several Alexas to listen to radio stations etc, but suddenly, commercials appeared on TuneIn and consistently interrupted my enjoyment. Especially the ads for services that aren‚Äôt relevant. And the ones that pop up during discussion programs. I‚Äôm thinking about ditching the Alexas and listening to music via other routes, and using them for shopping lists. Which to me is a huge disappointment and a waste of money	2	July 9, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Alexa app is a pain to use. Too many notifications about what you can so with it popping up. Alexa can‚Äôt distinguish between smart plugs named ‚Äúlights‚Äù and smart bulbs. Terrible sound quality. I‚Äôll never buy any Alexa enabled device in my life ever again. Although I‚Äôm not a fan of Google, at least Google Home assistant is more intelligent and easier to use (yes, you can simply say ‚Äúall lights on‚Äù and Google will turn on everything even if it has ‚Äúlights‚Äù in name). It feels like an Amazon spy in your house. Wanna buy more toilet paper? Alexa will interrupt and tell you that. Sorry Amazon, I‚Äôm not interested. Even Bluetooth sucks, because there is no way to lower Alexa‚Äôs voice and increase bluetooth volume (and yes I increased volume on my phone). Point for mute button.	1	October 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs exactly the same as my Alexa Echo except one VERY important thing. (At least to me) The sound. If you turn this dot all the way up you can stand over it and have a perfect conversation over it and music is not up I can‚Äôt even say loud because this will not get close to loud. So if you want it for a child‚Äôs room for music or anything it would be perfect. But not for everyday stuff. I use mine (Echo) for timers, music, and white noise. But I have to move it around, so I bought this one thinking it exactly the same except smaller, so I‚Äôll put the big one upstairs and the smaller one in the living room. But, no I was going to return it, but it will be fine for the kid‚Äôs playroom, they will just never be able to ‚Äúturn it up‚ÄùExample volume 5 on my Echo sounds about the same as volume 10 on the dot	3	June 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"My husband bought our very first Alexa for my birthday because he thought I'd enjoy the ""company"" since I work from home. We've not even had it for a year, and the one he bought me now only acknowledges the wake word, but doesn't do anything you ask it. Even after factory resetting it multiple times, and even though it's never been dropped, damaged, or wet. I contacted customer support and was told these devices only have a 90 day warranty, so our best bet is to just buy another one when they go on sale next. We've bought 5 other devices since the first, and now we're worried that all 5 will eventually fail like the first one. Not sure this is worth the $200+ every year if they're all going to go out like this one, especially with the limited amount of stuff they actually do. The only real thing we use them for is playing music while we do chores (which is great when your hands are soapy, dirty, or covered in oil), or turning off the lights when we're on the couch and in bed and don't want to have to get up again to turn them off. It is at least cool that you can group the devices together and then play music on all of them at once if you want, or that you can drop in on other rooms instead of yelling at each other. Other than that, how can we justify spending that kind of money on something that won't last and is just an ""okay"" speaker otherwise? It's just like my Apple Watch - expensive and useful in theory, but in practice not worth the badge. You use it for a couple of things, but it's definitely not as useful as they've told us."	2	September 30, 2020	0
Echo Dot	This was a gift to us because we liked the sound quality of the same unit my sister-in-law has. I've heard too many negative things about the privacy as far as what it hears, and I've also heard it can prompt young children to do not such good things. We only use it on occasion for music, and little else, (used it a lot for holiday music over the holidays) otherwise it sits turned off, or in a cupboard.	3	January 6, 2022	1

Echo Dot	The Dot does not seem to process requests as well as our old/original style Alexa. It‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs the operators fault since he doesn‚Äôt keep updated with the massive amount of information emailed to him. Still it can be quite frustrating.	3	March 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Constantly bombarded with 'her' saying, ""by the way..."" when I set an alarm, timer, ask the weather, etc. I don't need 'her' constantly annoying me with useless information or targeted marketing. And there is absolutely no way to turn it off! From Amazon Customer Service: ""Alexa occasionally provides feature hints or other information she believes to be useful to customers and there is no setting for turning these off currently.""I cannot wrap my head around why there is no way to completely turn off ‚Äúby the way..‚Äù notifications. I understand that this feature might be useful to some, and is probably a good marketing technique generally. It makes sense to have it on as a default, then, but to have no option to opt out if you find it annoying and invasive?? That‚Äôs such a turn-off. I‚Äôm researching other smart devices, because this is annoying beyond belief."	2	March 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I kept it but echo really lacks mid-range & treble. I was going to buy Samuel Jackson's voice but he does not have skills. Not only that but apparently Amazon realized he was popular so the price went from a buck to $5. I was rushed for time or otherwise this would have been returned. So you know my hearing has issues in the higher range, however I can hear mid & higher ranges well with other speakers. This speaker down fires into the plastic base & has been noted by others its muffled sound. Then Alexa's low nasal voice tone amplify's the problem.Addition 8/8/21  I found another voice just by asking Alexa to change her voice. It is a male and heenunciates, not the nasal verbage from Alexa. Note - don't even consider using logic questions with Alexa, its an act of frustration.	3	August 1, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Little aggravating hooking to tv	3	May 30, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"David Josue was my customer service chatbot / person.  I own multiple Echo device including an echo, FIreTV, several dots throughout my house.  They all work great except one of the new 3rd generation Dots recently purchased.  That new Dot drops my music streams around 8-10 times per hour, sometimes more...sometimes every song...and has done it right from the start.So what do I do?  I go online to request an exchange for a new functional Dot.  The system FORCES me to chat or speak on the phone with a customer service rep.  Okay, irritating, especially when I could have simply opted to return the item for a refund, and then buying another new one to accomplish this same task.  But, I'll do it.Over 2 hours later, after chatting with David through this time, I've provided lots of ridiculous info, router make and model, distance from router, other device info, etc., some of which may be relevant, but also including a DNA sample (kidding), and get this - approving his request for an Amazon rep to conduct a house visit to gather debug info from the Dot....?!?!?  Seriously, for a $30 device?!  I say ""sure!"" because at this point, I think they make this process as long and drawn out to dissuade people from getting this done...what else am I to think?  What would you think?So, David concludes by saying this will take several days to have the development team triage my data and get back to me via email about next steps...Meanwhile my device dropped the stream 11 times in a little over an hour while chatting with David.  He wraps our chat session by asking if he has addressed all my concerns and questions.  I tell him, well, ""No, not satisfactorily, but you know that don't you David?""  He responds -""Perfect! Have a great evening.""So now, I'm all in to see how utterly absurd this process will be to exchange the Dot for one that functions properly.  It goes without saying that I will not be recommending Echo devices to anyone and will be regaling them with the request for a home visit by Amazon before honoring the exchange request.  I seriously doubt anyone, including you kind readers, will believe it!  But, it's true.  I swear on my dog's life.So, what will come next??  I don't know but am waiting in awe of this stupidity and will update as it goes....UPDATE:  the second Dot that came in the order with the first one is now also dropping pandora streams, so it'll be a return for both, especially since I've not received the aforementioned email from the development team wanting to swing by the house for a debug and beer session.  I guess I'm done buying Echo devices until they work this out."	1	August 29, 2019	0
Echo Dot	It does not live up to the hype. It can do a few cute tricks, but you cannot ‚Ä¶ I repeat CANNOT ‚Ä¶ depending on this device or the app to do anything important. It simply isn‚Äôt reliable and it‚Äôs more frustrating than helpful.  I end up #%?!$ by the time I get the dumb thing to cooperate.As if all of that isn‚Äôt bad enough, this device is just one big ad for Amazon.  When requesting a skill be performed, get ready for a commercial.None of this is easy to set up.

Echo Dot	So I've tested my Echo dot on a few devices and it's perfectly ok if all you need is a cheap Alexa enabled device to play a little music or control your lights.  That's what it's good at.What I didn't anticipate was that the base would be so overpowering that listening to voices on podcasts, the news, or youtube videos would be near impossible.  Imagine everything is down pitched a whole octave.  I didn't have enormously high expectations but a cheap no-name brand speaker does better than this.  Going into settings and cranking the bass all the way down helps a little, but not enough.  That said if the only thing you will do with your speaker is listen to music, you might enjoy the bass-heavy sound.  Just know that using this to listen to people talk or listen to dialogue is probably out of the question.My other critique is that these speakers should really have an audio-in jack instead of audio out, or better yet, both.  If I wanted to have an audio out jack, I'd buy an Alexa Input device for half the price.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  Maybe the regular Echo and Echo Studio are better.	3	June 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Works horribly with Spotify. Forces you to use an alexa app and doesn‚Äôt allow you to cast from Spotify app. Very frustrating. The alexa app doesn‚Äôt let you find music and linking it with more than one is a pain. Also the sound quality is very bad especially with bass	2	August 25, 2022	0

Echo Dot	"I've used Echo dots for close to 5 years now. The features and functionality are limited at best, and have hardly advanced at all in those years.At some point, they started a feature where Alexa responds with ""By the way, [...]"" after you give a command that does not warrant a reply, such as ""set a timer"" or ""turn on the light"". These are incredibly intrusive, obnoxious, uncalled for - this is a device, not a human, and it has no place interjecting additional BS when I ask it to perform a simple task.They've taken this one step further recently, however, by turning those ""By the way"" interjections into actual advertisements. I just set a time and my Echo Dot responded with ""By the way, did you know we now have premium timer tones available for purchase? Would you like to purchase one?""You have absolutely no right piping advertisements directly into my home, especially for a product I PAID MONEY FOR. This isn't some freemium app supported by ads. Shame on you Amazon. This is the final straw - I'm ripping these sad, useless devices out and replacing them all with Google Home minis which at least don't try to advertise to me (yet).On another note: I once left a review on an older generation of Amazon Echo, and someone from Amazon literally called me on my mobile phone to ask about the review - but then asked me to provide personal information to confirm it was actually me they were talking to. Are you kidding me? You're going to call me, unsolicited, and then ask me to prove who I am just so you can address a review that I didn't ask to be contacted about? Y'all have seriously misunderstood (or just completely disregarded) the concept of customer experience. What a sad company you've turned into."	1	August 19, 2021	0

Echo Dot	When it works, it is a fantastic device; got it during the buy a 1 month subscription of Amazon Music, get a free Alexa and very happy with my purchase.When it doesn‚Äôt work however - Alexa can only know so much; sometimes she‚Äôll either give you the wrong answer (Alexa assuming a similar question) or she won‚Äôt know.And then when she doesn‚Äôt know, Amazon has a program that allows Amazon users to answer questions for other Alexa owners. This program is ultra sensitive with the questions you ask (even if they‚Äôre not offensive.)For example, even though Jeffrey Epstein did terrible things, the Alexa program won‚Äôt tell you where his island is located. I understand the connection, but I guess everyone Jeffrey Epstein said hello to is also off limits.	3	August 20, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"Amazon KNOWS people don't live solitary lives, we all have friends, many of us have kids. These devices shouldn't be able to spend real money with a ""YES"" but they can, and though you can change the settings, the reason why they're shipped like that is very clear, they want your accidentally spent money, and morally, that's like bars getting all their money from people with serious life problems.

Echo Dot	It‚Äôs a pretty decent speaker for basic demands, ordering, timers, etc‚Ä¶ but the sound quality could be a little better, speaker distorts easily with bass. But you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a smart speaker with decent sound quality the Echo 4th gen sounds pretty damn good for it‚Äôs size and it truly delivers small to medium room filling sound. I also recommend if you are an Apple Fan the HomePod Mini has pretty good sound quality as well.	3	December 6, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I won an Echo Dot from a local radio station. I am happy I did not go and buy this smart speaker because it does not meet my expectations. You cannot change the base in this speaker. It is far too much bass and not enough treble so  all of the words spoken on a radio station or audio book are muffled. Alexa is very responsive but she tells me I cannot increase the treble.	3	December 15, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Negative: Gives you incomplete or false information to encourage you to purchase through Amazon.Example: I needed a lemon to make muffins and asked when the local Walmart opened, Alexa refused to acknowledge the store 3 miles down the road and would only give me stores farther than 100 miles from me. I then asked for the nearest Subway, it listed the Subway that used to be in the local Walmart pre-pandemic. Do not ask Alexa for information, as it will mislead you.Positive: It connects to and controls smart home devices fairly easily, with minor bugs.Example: I can turn on and control some settings on an air conditioner, but it doesn't read the temperature correctly so I can't tell it to increase or decrease based on that. Works great for binary controls though, like light switches.	3	July 31, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I already owned one of the new Alexa's and love the sound and ease-of-use...so did my son, so he kidnapped her from my kitchen to his room!  I bought the Echo Dot because the price was right and thought since it came with the Alexa feature, it would sound just as good.  Unfortunately, while the Dot does still have the same ease-of-use as the larger Alexa, the quality of sound doesn't compare.  The larger Alexa seems to have a more clear quality with music, even when asking her to increase the bass.  I tried the same with the Dot and it does increase the bass, but it becomes a little raspy, like a cheap set of car speakers.I have to admit, I really don't use the Dot or Alexa for anything but to listen to music when I'm downstairs, so, I can't attest to the rest of it's features.  I can say, if you're looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use device, the Echo Dot will suffice.  However, if you don't mind spending a little more to be able to enjoy a better quality sound, the larger Alexa model is definitely the better choice.  In fact, since my son only listens to ""talk radio"", I'm going to switch the devices while he's in school...he'll never know the difference!  HaHa"	3	December 20, 2019	1

Echo Dot	First time buying a product like this, I'm glad I invested the money into a deal I had found online versus pay the original price. In my opinion, I don't think I would have purchased this for the amount it actually costs, I don't think it's worth it.Overall, it's a decent product. The biggest downfall- IT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT WIFI OR WITHOUT THE DEVICE BEING PLUGGED IN!! Regardless of those MAJOR problems...The Alexa integration is not bad, it does for the most part respond to what you ask and it does entertain all age groups. The timer and reminder settings on the echo dot are extremely convenient. I also love that this is a Bluetooth speaker as well but majorly disappointed in the sound quality!! You do get what you pay for though and this product is not big on size to produce an extreme amount of sound. Again, it could be better but I'm still very glad I have it.I honestly purchased this for the Bluetooth speaker so there are other functions and capabilities I'm sure I'm not aware of that make this product better by chance so take that into consideration if you do decide to buy.	3	June 12, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I really like Alexa; it beats the Google Assistant in a lot of ways (not all though) but I will focus on the actual Echo Dot in this review. The speaker has four microphones on it and they pick up voices amazingly well. The speaker looks nice and I really like the buttons on top that make controlling it even easier. I also think that the speaker (actually 3 speakers within) has the potential to sound pretty good. But, there are some issues that really keep me from enjoying this. First: the sound tuning just seems off. It is really bass heavy which would normally be great but since the speaker is so small it just makes everything else sound less pronounced and muddy. Second: the sound randomly becomes distorted sometimes, especially when playing on a Bluetooth speaker. I‚Äôm not talking about a little white noise, I mean it sounds like you‚Äôre losing signal to a radio station; it cuts in and out. Amazon knows about that issue but they haven‚Äôt pushed out an update to fix it as of Feb 2020. So, because of these sound issues, I can‚Äôt really recommend getting an Echo Dot 3rd Gen. The new Google Nest Mini, though less bassy, sounds astonishingly better and what good is a speaker if it sounds bad?	3	February 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Okay, so I prefer Amazon's device over Google's even though it's not as intuitive or useful. You have to hook it to a surround sound system if you don't like crackle and speaker pop. In spite of this, I just hate Google enough that Amazon's products like these are my go to choice.	3	January 28, 2022	1

So, I unplugged the DOT and in a few hours, I had my stove and dryer back to normal. Few days later, tried again and it did the same thing to the appliances. Unplugged. Also flipped the main breakers. Waited a few days, then plugged the DOT into a different outlet on a different breaker. Within 24 hours, my TV had viewing issues on some of the channels. Wobbly lines. This lasted for several hours. Unplugged the TV cable and replugged. No luck.  Finally unplugged the DOT. So. Dot is in my closet. I am going to try one more time and reset to factory and try to start the process over again. If it is affecting certain appliances in the house, then I cannot use it. Super disappointed and don't know how to fix.	2	January 11, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I previously ordered the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa and it worked out great. It is easy to set up and connects to other devices that are Alexa compatible. I decided to buy a battery base for the Echo dot to make it more portable around the house. That's when I found out that the AUX device pin receptacle was misaligned which prevents the device cable to attach properly. I returned it via UPS as per Amazon Customer Service instruction (which cost me $5 at UPS since I threw away the packaging required to send it back), and I had it replaced with another Echo Dot. I just received it and this one has the same defect. I wonder if Amazon is aware of this quality control issue happening with this product!? This defect will not allow for any AUX device to be attached as an AUX speaker or battery base.	3	June 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	In a world where we literally choose which conglomerate we allow to spy on us, Alexa is the Amazon option.  Trading our privacy for small conveniences.BTW, I did not buy this, it came with a purchase and my son thinks it's cool not having to flip a light switch.	3	January 27, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"This one replaced another Echo Dot (3rd Gen) because the speaker had gone bad after about 3 years.  The new one has a ""tinny"" speaker out of the box.  The primary location of this Dot is by our exercise equipment.  Our primary use for this unit is to listen to music while we work out."	3	January 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I have other voice assistants and do not mind them. The echo dot is good for the most part. It has higher quality sound than some other comparable assistants out there. Seems to hear me for the most part when I am talking to it. My biggest complaint though and something that gets more annoying with time is how intrusive Alexa is. Alexa constantly makes suggestions to me about how I can set modes and automatic weather or traffic updates. I even turned off settings to stop this and I see no changes. When I ask Alexa to turn on a light I do not need it to then blab on about what else Alexa can do. Its honestly annoying as can be. I want to say ""turn on a light"" and she turns on a light nothing else. Or tell me the weather and she tells me the weather. Rather I find that after the short answer to what I asked Alexa to do I get a long drawn out explanation of what else it can do. If this happened once that would be fine but I find that for years after using the echo dot I still get the same explanations over and over. It honestly makes me want to toss the thing in the garbage."	1	June 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The second quality is very low	3	May 15, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Update: Returned.I frequenly interact with my Echo devices, but it's not so easy with the 3rd generation Dot. It is hard for me to understand what Alexa is saying. I tried to adjust the audio, but nothing I tried changed that problem. However, the Dot's audio is fine for listening to the news and music. That, rather than Alexa's voice, comes through clearly.I bought the 3rd gen Dot because many reviews for the 4th generation say it isn't an upgrade from the 3rd, and some say the 4th gen is inferior. I had hoped the Dot would improve on the Echo Flex I was using (it often ignored comands and another device would answer even though the other device was rooms away from where I was and the Flex is just a few feet from me. But Alexa's voice on the Flex was far superior to what it is on the new Dot. I'm not sure I'll keep the Dot. I may fish the Flex out of the trash.	2	January 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The sound quality, at least with this one, was very poor. We gave it away.	3	May 5, 2022	1
Echo Dot	In general, the third generation Echo Dot functions as well previous generations, but it makes Alexa sound like she's talking through a pillow. Bizarre! The 3rd Gen Dot may have improved a tad in the quality of music playback; not enough to prevent listening fatigue from setting in very quickly, though. The contours of the new generation are more pleasant to look at. That said, does anyone buy a Dot to look at it?	3	December 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I bought this to replace our Alexa echo from 2016.  We love our Alexa echo and use it everyday.  So I wanted an upgrade.  the new one 3rd gen the sound is marbled.  I cannot listen to podcasts or any lyrics on it as its so hard to understand.  the oldest one we have is amazingly clear but its been breaking up a little after 7 years of daily use.	2	July 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I have both Google minis and the Echo dot in my home and the Echo sound is very muffled.  Everything else about it is fine but I just can't get past the poor sound quality and don't think I'd ever buy another.	3	February 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have 2 other Echo Dots. I purchased this 3rd one to take in my RV.It is not near as good as my other two. She doesn't answer like she should when asked a question  I know is easy for her.Very disappointed.	3	February 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It's ok but the thing I noticed different from also having the 2nd gen, is that it takes longer to respond to you and sometimes it don't at all, so that's why I only give it 3 stars. I like the look of gen 3 better but I actually prefer the gen 2 over this one because of it's quick response and it can hear you better from far off. I almost thought about just returning the 2 new dots that I have but since they no longer have gen 2 available, I'll just hang onto them. Thought about trading in the older dot for new when I was buying the new dots, now I'm glad I didn't!( I'm not for sure if the 3rd gen echo dot is worst or it's my hotspot, being that I just found out that I'm maxed out on my hotspot. I have the new google nest mini and google nest hub now also and I'm having the same problems with it not working as well sometimes, no response at times.  It could be that this dot works just fine if you are using it with a good internet setup. So I really can't say for sure it's not as good, this has just been what I'm experiencing with this dot.)	3	December 26, 2019	1
Echo Dot	When I got the echo dot it was working okay. Didn't always understand everything but I've only had it for less than two weeks and it cuts out and sounds like its skipping on songs and when things are talking. No clue why. I like that it can know whose talking but you need to add in understand children better.	3	January 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	First let me say I love my dot and Alexa! However my dot is not working as it should and I had to take it offline until I can afford to replace it.And replace it I will what's not to like about Alexa I talk with her everyday.	3	February 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Alexa has a hard time understanding the names of foreign artists - specifically Korean - as she doesn't listen all the way to the command. Even when I type it into the Alexa app, she somehow gets it incorrect. Also, when I ask for a certain song due to me not having Amazon Music and I use Apple Music she will reply with ""To play specific songs you must have Amazon Music"" or with something very similar. She will say she can't find a specific song on Apple Music when I know for sure the song is there because most of the time I'm..looking at it on Apple Music on my laptop.It is frustrating to have to either type in the song I want Alexa to play or have to repeat myself multiple times for her to understand. If she could understand names, and not default them to ""American"" or ""English speaking"" artists the echo would get a 5/5. Until that is fixed...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't listen to traditionally American/mainstream artists."	3	December 20, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I bought it for the supposed better sound quality, But I am disappointed. Music sounds good on it, but Alexa's voice is very muffled and difficult to understand. I'm very disappointed that Amazon would put this on the market without correcting the issue.	3	February 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is still great for a lot things if I am inputting a shopping list, for example. But if I want to know the weather or play music, this 3rd gen Echo is a disappointment. It's sometimes staticy and sometimes lives up to its name ... it echoes or sounds as if it is underwater.I still have one of my 1st gens and its sound quality is much, much better than this.	3	December 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I bought this product thinking I could sync it with my Alexa devices but truthfully this one and the others I have bought have been a huge let down. Even after you sync them which is a process that could go a lot easier and download the skills the product doesn‚Äôt perform properly. You could speak right into the speaker or from any distance really and still have to repeat yourself a lot. Even after repeating yourself it may say that skill, song or book isn‚Äôt available even though it‚Äôs something the device has already done before. You tell the device to play in a group and it repeats the group and song of choice and still only plays on one speaker or not at all. The funny thing is it can hear really well. I could be in a place with no devices and make a noise and it would hear it and respond. Also it will just randomly blink a different color when nothing is wrong and completely stop responding or not respond at all.	1	August 30, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Not something I would ever buy, gifted to us. Set up and used about a week. I don't need or want constant background music. I don't need her to answer my questions. I can time things for myself. I haven't found a good use for her.	3	February 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	So mine had a tone and would make me repeat stuff... and the commercials on my tv was going to what it was saying... like a demon. I hit it with a hammer threw it away. I paid $1 on a discount also... was $50 on sale for $1 with 1 month of amazon music... which by the way doesnt link youtube videos on the xfinity flex amazon music app... alexa also wasnt compatible with the xfinity flex box...The box also is sturdy and hard to damage and makes u angry cus it was being rude and controlling my tv commercials being creepy and demonic... I hate amazon now...I want a refund and explanation kinda scary.	1	October 12, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Every other commercial says ‚Äújust say Alexa add (so-and-so) to my cart‚Äù.. Well guess who hears her name, then replied?  ALEXA!  Unplugged it and only plug in if I want to listen to Amazon music (& my phones dead)!And there‚Äôs one you WONT see reviews for: Amazon Music (esp. unlimited!)They must‚Äôve NOT wanted to get negative feedback about people being billed for a service that Amazon asks ‚Äúwould you like a reminder when the service is about to end?‚Äù And they never GIVE said notice (but they DO give you a BILL)! üëé	3	October 17, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I got this as a gift to use in my workroom basically just as a radio because it has a ""FREE"" listening option.  I have no desire for yet another bill every month so I figured it'd be okay and save space. I thought the free version would just have normal commercials and adds but the music would be fine. Well the ""FREE"" listening option without signing up and paying every month is a joke. No matter what style of music you choose to listen to it only shuffles through 15 to 20 songs from each style you choose. It plays the same handful of songs over and over. At least half of these songs are lesser known or lesser wanted versions like the Whitesnake ""hobo"" version of ""Here I go Again"" if you ask to hear 80's hair metal for example. The volume of each song is different as well. Some are a lot louder than others and you have to keep adjusting the volume as you listen if you want it all the same. The speaker strength is nothing to brag about either even for such a small device.  Also, the music styles you chose will sometimes be contaminated with songs from other styles. Adding insult to injury Amazon sticks their own spoken adds in among the terrible selection of ""FREE"" music you get telling you to join up for better options. And yes, I know this thing is supposed to be used for and with other stuff and I'm assuming if you pay every month it'd be a million times better. I'm just giving my opinion on what I wanted it for. If you don't sign up for the paid version you're basically getting a 45-minute commercial that repeats. So, if you just want to listen to something for free as a radio with no hassle and no extra bill every month...just buy a radio."	2	February 10, 2020	0
Echo Dot	This is the entry level, Echo to the entire Amazon echo world. However, you will be very bitterly disappointed at this entry-level speaker. The sound is truly awful and it mimics that of a very cheap speaker. It is almost impossible to hear the speaking voice for directions and request by ALEXA. Any type of music has muffled sound very very poor mid range if any mid range at all. This is the worst sound from the worst speaker you will ever hear. If you are interested in getting into the a LEX a world by an echo that is a step up from this one. Do not get this one.	1	October 16, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It was a gift which i appreciated but I discovered this isn't the echo with Time on front......which makes me think why didn't they make them all with a standard time on the front with all of them....it just makes sense to me - but i'll probably place it somewhere as a speaker for music -	3	January 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This came with a smart bulb which was a good value but I could not get the smart bulb to work with Alexa so I had to unpair them and uninstall the Alexa app and start over from scratch. Needless to say the smart bulb is now sitting on the counter and she is working fine now.	3	January 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I replaced an old Echo Dot Gen 2 hoping for improvements.  Yes, it's much louder.  This was my first goal.  However, most of the increased volume is in the BASS region.  Music sounds excellent, but it ruins the clarity of the speech from the IHeart Radio stations, etc.  I tried to adjust the frequency response in the APP but it has very little affect.  I have 6 other models of various types and ages.  They all sound excellent.	3	November 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It's cheap and does its job somewhat, but it's really unreliable. Sometimes voice commands don't work and integrations with things such as smart lights are very finicky. Also severe delays randomly, Alexa will do the task a few seconds after you give the command. Wouldn't recommend for any important tasks.	3	January 31, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I am a tech geek.I have been a proponent of the benefits of the technological innovations since the late 1990's, and I don't mind dropping a dime on things I am generally interested in, or something I see genuine benefit from, which I why I purchased 2 Alexa Dots.No one suggested: ""Oh by the way... an Echo Dot would be nice"", or ""Did you know..."", to try to compel me into purchasing something I didn't want or need.Before buying the dots, I was tentative and went back and forth between this and Google's product. But someone gifted us Facebook's Portal, which embedded Alexa by default, and we liked how Alexa integrated our IoT devices perfectly. So after noticing that general conversations turned into FB ads, we replaced the portal with our 2nd Dot.Not long after, the 'Oh, by the ways' started creeping in, prompting me to extensively investigate how to turn these unwarranted invasions prompts off. Towards the end of summer, every other 'Alexa' request/engagement became an unwarranted invasion of thought, focus, activity.  The last time I used ""the Dot"" was after I needed an '11 minute timer for pasta', while preparing a family meal, only to be nudged by some inane BS, this multi-billion dollar corporation NEEDED for me to purchase.Really?If I really wanted whatever the Amazon algorithms presumed would be a good thing for me at that most inopportune time, I would research it, and purchase it myself without a DAMN prompt!Purchasing anything related to Alexa or the Echo Dot, is like paying a telemarketer to call you just because you want the benefit of your telephone."	1	December 20, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Sound: The sounds is alright. For a cheap-ish bluetooth speaker it isn‚Äôt too bad, but depending on how you use you will find some limitations. Sonically no one will be blown away, but it functions.Connectivity: This has been a nightmare. I have two of these. They will randomly show the blue and orange lights, go back into setup modes, turn on Alexa from disabled and require completely removing the pairing and starting over. Super frustrating and both units do it. Bluetooth seems pretty good, but can delay at times. I have yet to have any luck with the aux cable, though... on either of them.Alexa: It can hear me and most of the time understands very basic stuff. It doesn‚Äôt integrate with a lot of stuff I use, so it severely limits functionality.Compatibility: No Google support sucks. I have hoping to use the speakers in a right and left config as they had been setup, but you are limited in that regard. Play Music not having native support sucks, but I can just connect to bluetooth. It would great to have the wizardry available outside of some weird backend stuff that Amazon is doing on their servers.Summary: If you get this free or for a dollar or something, awesome. 100% no-go at full price. If you have invested in another ecosystem, make sure to verify full compatibility, even at half off. You can pickup wireless speakers for around the same price that are better, but lack Alexa. If Alexa is what you desperately want, then this is totally for you.	2	August 12, 2020	0
Echo Dot	So we bought this for our retail store, unfortunately, we have to keep telling ALEXA , put on 100.5 , numerous times a day . She just shuts off , mid song ??? Not sure why ??	3	February 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"10/25/2020: For the last two days all Echo says is I'm having trouble connecting. Everything else works and connects fine. They will have to go back. I'll go back to using my previous gens. They say it from time to time but at least when they do I don't feel bad about wasting my money. I was sure the wifi would be more robust in this model but I was wrong.10/23/2020: Just as I suspected, the music was tailored to make me want to try Amazon Music. It was nice, but no go. I have a huge music library that I can play for free any time I like. I'm chronically ill so I'm rarely in a music or dancing mood. Covid has only made my life harder than it was, like it has for everyone. I do really like the device so I upped my rating to 4-stars and won't be needing the new gen that is getting really poor reviews. Saved some money there that I will use for mounting solutions and a skin or two at some point. Everyone please stay safe and well!10/22/2020: Reset the Echo and it still couldn't play my audiobook. Tried each of the other two Echos and neither of them would play it either. Something's up, but honestly, this is way at the bottom of my list. I figure it will work itself out later. The reason I upped it to 3-stars is that when I asked for music, something I never do because I don't want to trigger ads, Echo hit a home-run with each and every one on each device. Perfect music for me that made me cry. Amazon knows me way too well. Keeping all three, non-playing audiobooks be damned.Original: I don't ask much of my device, the weather (on occasion), sunset / sunrise time, lights on and off. My first test echo failed. Asked to play audiobook and she told me four times ""playing, how long was left, etc."", but never made a sound. Total and complete waste of my time."	1	October 19, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"I received this as a Christmas gift. I use my Computer, iPad and Android when seeking information. The sound isn't as clear as Siri.

Echo Dot	Got a new wifi router the Eerro 6. I setup my wifi with the same name and password all my other devices can automatically connect except my echo that‚Äôs beyond unacceptable. I shouldn‚Äôt have to reconnect it to wifi when nothing changed and all my other smart devices automatically connected to my new router.Because of that I won‚Äôt be switching my google homes to Alexa.	2	July 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	One thing that I would suggest is that it is a wireless device not to be plugged in all the time. Seems kind of useless to be located in one particular spot all the time. Low level music and voice are muffled and not very clear	3	February 4, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I've had this for 2wks, now. It worked like a dream fresh out of the box. However, it seems like the longer I have it the more problems I have. The voice recognition is hit or miss.  If I wanted to be ignored every other time when I called it's name, I'd talk to my kids. At first I thought it may be a noise issue. (Too much stuff going on in the background.) Unfortunately, it will do the same thing when it's dead silent. Other occasions, it will recognize that I've said ""Echo"" but will not complete the demand.  For example, I'll say ""Echo,"" it lights up and it lights up. I say ""Set alarm for 0430"" almost immediately after and it's a coin toss as to if it will actually do anything.  It also tends to sporadically stop playing Amazon Music. I haven't had any problems with that when playing the local stations. I've checked the connection when it acts up and WiFi seems to be 100%, so I don't believe any of this is simply a connection issue.  I'm not sure if this is a regular thing, but it also tends to ""ding"" randomly.  Like it's reconnecting or something, but there wasn't anything wrong with the connection that I've seen."	3	December 3, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"I have a gen 1, and the voice that comes out is crisp and clear.I bought another gen 3 and it's louder, and has more bass.Problem is, that when you want voice interaction, it's so basie, it's muddled.Music is much better for sure, but you use and receive voice more than listening to music.Personally I didn't need ""louder"" so much, and voice tone was fine for me.And lately it has problems answering the wake word. By the 3rd request I find myself shouting at it to WAKE UP. Sometimes it just wont respond. It won't wake up when it's playing to ask it to stop and powering down is the only way to abort it's current actions.Often, a light ring appears at the wake word, then quickly goes out , even with repeated requests.These are server problems and that should be noted, but since Amazon has no feedback links this is where I complain.This gen is junk in my opinion. Expensive junk.Now 4-8-20 A growing list of gen 3 problems. It has been a recurring problem for Alexa to light up on the wake word but the command is not followed and the light just goes out. Over & over. It just has response problems.Now I asked it to play something from Amazon music and it says its playing, but no audio comes out. Over & over. I cancelled my music subscription because no one is answering their CS line. But I wondered if it would be the same on my gen 1 and lo and behold it played. It's pretty plain (to me anyway) that gen 3 is a lemon. Oh and about the gen 3? I powered it down and it played just fine.Amazon, you can take your gen3's and throw them in the lake. It's just an annoying piece of electronics."	2	January 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"My husband got the Echo ""free"" with an order, and it sat in the box, unused, for a very long time.  So, I thought I would check it out and try it - bad idea!  Sure, I could ask for the weather (not that impressive, really), but when I asked for a certain song to play, ""Alexa"" offered the unlimited music subscription for 14.99/month.  ""NO!""  I said.  Well, my 6-year-old twins were excited to hear the Echo play ""Baby Shark,"" and when I wasn't in the room, they asked for a song and agreed to the music subscription without my knowing!  WHAT?!  Then, despite trying to cancel TWICE, I see a charge in my bank account, resulting in me having to cancel my debit card and file a dispute claim.  Such a hassle and headache.  All because I turned on this stupid speaker for ONE day.  Total rip-off.  Bad idea"	1	September 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"PLEASE come up with a way for the machine to physically answer you when you call out the Wake word WITH A VERBAL RESPONSE, example good evening user name here HOW MAY I ASSIST  as I am getting sick and tired of having to repeat myself time after time when the machine either does not hear me and or does not answer me when I Do infact speak to it to it plus if these machines are supposed to be ""smart speakers"" why can't they answer questions without responding with ""I don't know that one"" which happens 80% of the time? Furthermore in regards to not being heard that shouldn't happen at all considering I have multiple speakers in my home so there is no reason for the system to not HEAR anyone. in regards to answers to questions it's like the only thing it searches for is the Amazon database & if the desired question & answer is not in the Amazon database it has no clue. I'm seriously thinking about replacing all of my speakers in my house with the Google home equivalent I've been using Google products since Android froyo came out and Google has NEVER ONCE told me it does not know the answer to something. Because I can ask Alexa the same question I ask Google back to back and majority of the time Alexa says she doesn't know the answer whereas  Google gives me the answer immediately something's wrong with that picture &  for god sakes the most important Part is I don't have to repeat myself to Google.I apologize but I'm really irritated with the echo experience and borderline regret the purchase."	1	November 23, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Got it on sale. Never interacted with one till my daughter-in-law used it at Thanksgiving for keeping track of when to make what for dinner and music. I thought it was pretty cool.

Echo Dot	"I ordered many items to set my 'smart home' up, which included several different echo's. Apart from missing some commands now and then, their functionality overall is decent. But Amazon has really dropped the ball on how it handles music, and trying to get it resolved has been the worst customer service issue we've ever ran into with Amazon. If you're wanting music, and you are single, go for it. If you're not single, here's what you could be in for- my wife had prime for years. But when it comes to buying, setting up, and using technology, that's my area. Well, as it turns out, you can NOT do that and have music work. Because I don't pay for a second prime account (why would I? She's the shoppaholic) all of our devices will not allow us to prime music, because they are 'mine'. Amazon customer service has been useless getting this resolved. This leaves us with two options- cancelling her account and changing everything she uses, is signed into, all of the stored credit card info, losing whatever benefits she has, resetting tv app etc. because it will no longer work. Or we (I) need go through and setup all of the devices all over again under account, which who knows what issues I would have tying them back into the security system, cameras, thermostat, light switches, outlets, door locks, and whatever else we have. They're literally in the same house, at the same address, with our same names as everything else. But how horrible it would be for Amazon to let us use these -speakers- with the music that we pay for. If I had it to do over again I would have went with the ""other brand"" smart home devices instead. I will not be adding any other Amazon devices going forward."	2	February 10, 2020	0
Echo Dot	So I received this as part of a promotion. I had to sign up for amazon music and then received this for $1. I was initially very excited just to have a decent, somewhat portable speaker. Unfortunately there was a bit of a rattle coming from the speaker as soon as I set it up. At first this didn't bother me too much but it got progressively worse over the next couple weeks. Now it sounds like a blown speaker. I've never even come close to turning this up loud so I know it's not my fault. Would love to get a replacement but am not being offered one, likely because it was part of a promotion. I just think that if they're only going to offer the $1 back, then they should also refund the amount paid for amazon music, seeing as getting the echo for $1 was the only reason I signed up for it.	2	January 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	So we have 3 of these. For some reason, when I call my daughters Alexa, it will make both my daughters and my sons ring. If my son is calling mine, it says its my daughter. Other than that it works great!	3	February 4, 2022	1
Echo Dot	1 star means zero. I do not like that Amazon suggested I buy this when my years of shopping with them (plus my billing address) should have told them I use a freight forwarder to send the goods on to The Bahamas. The reason is that the Alexa app does not work here. I do not understand what the problem is. Google Home is available here. What is Amazon's problem with The Bahamas? Bahamians buy tons of stuff from Amazon every day. Fire TV sticks work here. Why not smart speakers? I am very disappointed.	1	October 25, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Spotify does not work very well! When you have more than one device it gets kind of slow‚Ä¶ it keeps saying: this command is not supported right now!	3	March 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	device is bulky	3	May 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I got this because the price was right ($20).  It's good for talking to Alexa and playing music if you don't care how bad it sounds ;).	3	March 15, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I‚Äôve had an Amazon echo for several years now, my home is almost fully automated and just recently alexa just started to crap out. 1. She can‚Äôt control the lights in the house anymore, she can run her programming but I can‚Äôt tell her ‚Äúkitchen lights 100%‚Äù she acts like the lights aren‚Äôt set up 2. She stopped playing music on Pandora because they are trying to get you to subscribe to Amazon Music 3. If she actually plays what I ask her to she plays it on the wrong echo, I‚Äôll ask for a song in to play in the living room and she‚Äôll play it in the nursery. I don‚Äôt need Megan Thee Stallion blasting in my kids room while he‚Äôs trying to take nap. And if I‚Äôm specific and say play a song on Living Room Echo she tells me it doesn‚Äôt exist half the the time and the other half of the time it‚Äôll work 4. She always mishears me but that‚Äôs been since day one, I put up with it because every thing else worked. I‚Äôm going to sell my 7 echos and make the switch to Google Home	1	July 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Alexa it self good for daily work there is no doubt. But, the one I have is not clear sound. I did not notice 2 weeks then when i use i found it has no clear sound. now, neither I can exchange it nor i can fix clear sound,	3	January 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Ok. So, I rarely write negative reviews. But I'm so shocked by how bad all of my 3 Alexa's are functioning that I have to leave feedback.First of all, expect at least half of the functions not to be working. Even the easiest things like changing the wifi on your Alexa. Or Alexa recognizing devices. My devices are all about 3 months old and since the beginning, everything was a fight. Connecting lamps was a fight. Using spotify is a fight (she chooses the wrong songs all the time, even if the song is super popular).And Fire Tv has been the worst so far. I got a Fire Tv stick just so I could use voice control for Netflix or Prime. But from the very start Alexa only searched for movies but never played them. Costumer service could not help I had just had to accept. If you want to increase or decrease volume, she suddenly mutes the tv all together. Lately she hasn't done anything for fire tv at all.I got all 3 Alexa echo dots at the same time, thinking they would work. One of them I gave to my father. The app is supposed to work on Android 5.0 or higher. Of course the app did not work on his Android 5.01 phone. After hours of trying to fix it, I connected it to my own phone which is actually not a good idea but I had no choice. Anyway, of course connecting smart lamps (philips hue) took ages too.In the end I have to say the amount of time I struggled with Alexa overweighs the time she was of use. I just tried to connect my Alexa to a new wifi and guess what? Even this easy function does not work because Amazon makes everything to complicated and wants Alexa to connect to my phone's wifi, and not directly to the wifi itself.Facepalm. Overall I'm really disappointed, Amazon. By the way, if you use Alexa to send messages, expect her to cut you off at random so you have to repeat the whole message again.The amount of rage trying to make it work is insane. And despite what you might be thinking, I'm not actually the rage kind of person. But this is just ridiculous.	1	March 20, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"I like it, but wish it was less responsive if at all to other voices.  I'll be watching tv, and a commercial will say ""Hey Alexa,"" and it responds.  Otherwise I enjoy the product."	3	February 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I purchased this product to replace the old alexa. This little machine likes to turn on the lights in the middle of the night when your asleep. It has done it several times. I will troubleshoot and if it continues it goes back.	3	January 27, 2022	1
Echo Dot	El sonido es MUY malo y no es tan inteligente	3	May 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Other than the aesthetic appeal, this generation is trash compared to the original.  I hadn't upgraded because I didn't think I needed to.  Now I feel like my suspicions have been confirmed.	2	August 29, 2022	0
Echo Dot	So this little machine is a very good buy but I don‚Äôt like how I need to pay to hear music and play games. Like I wanted it for music but I don‚Äôt wanna pay. So now I just use it for Bluetooth! Umm it‚Äôs ver convenient! Just those pricey add on‚Äôs. Would I recommend?? Nah not really cause I basically use it as a radio so it‚Äôs really whatever.	2	July 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Amazon changed their previous Alexa from not recognizing text with cussing to a new design that will respond to cussing as wellu. However now both of my TVs that are paired to it or not responsive to Alexa I have a gaming TV and a Roku TV and neither are responding	3	December 29, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"The device is great, it hears your voice and responds promptly, the volume is more than high enough, the design is nice. However, a few problems gave me a bad taste overall. The device has an AUX input but completely lacks the feature to be used as an AUX speaker (the AUX input is essentially functionally useless). Another issue involves the ""skills"" that Alexa has, one such being the Spotify ""skill"" that allows you to play music on command. The issue arises any time I ask Alexa to play a song or playlist, it doesn't play the song or playlist that I asked but rather some random playlist called ""[name of song] radio,"" which proceeds to play random music."	3	August 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	So far I've mostly only used my Alexa for listening to Spotify, so I am not sure of her full potential, however I do see areas that could be improved. For example, if I ask her a question while the music is playing, she won't pause the music to answer the question but instead talks over the music which I find a bit annoying. Since they do favor towards Amazon music, I am unable to ask her to like songs or add songs to playlists on my Spotify account. Another thing I noticed is that I will ask her a question and she will not answer or won't give me the results when asked to read my notifications. I also wish the device was wireless so I could take it around the house without needing an outlet. Aside from these issues listed above, I have enjoyed using my Echo.	3	May 29, 2021	1
Echo Dot	the alexa sometimes will start talking to me for no reason as loud as possible in the middle of the night	3	April 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I‚Äôm extremely unhappy with Amazon. I‚Äôve been a very loyal Prime member for a very long time and the fact that you aren‚Äôt honoring your offer is aggravating,maddening and saddening and now has me questioning why I pay for Prime benefits. I was offered, without asking, a refund and told I could keep the device if it was ever to arrive. Obviously I chose to to do this. Well my echo finally arrived but it has been deactivated and I‚Äôm unable to use it. Let me state; I understand the security issues as these devices are attached to our accounts and appreciate that Amazon takes a proactive stance here however now my device is now nothing more than a paperweight. I contacted Amazon and have been told that I will need to repay for the device or they will not release the lock on it. So then the offer I received has not been upheld and I‚Äôm forced to either pay for it or have a useless piece of plastic and metal that will be sitting in a dump decomposing long after all of us are gone. Very disappointing.  Why offer something that you don‚Äôt plan to honor!!??  In the past I‚Äôve had issues with orders and deliveries as I order, quite literally, everything from Amazon and they are typically resolved to my satisfaction or at least in a matter that makes sense however this time you really dropped the ball, Amazon.	2	January 10, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Bought 3 for my small house. Doesn‚Äôt pick up voice and have to literally scream in bedroom and dinning room. In basement doesn‚Äôt always pick up. Also doesn‚Äôt get as loud as I would like when playing music, connected to my sound bar and still low. Considering buying 2 more. Doesn‚Äôt make sense.	3	December 25, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Excellent for about 20 bucks. great sound. Got this and placed one in garage and one in the bathroom. love having music in garage and the bathroom. Wont pay 40 or 50 for this but 20 is a perfect price.	3	January 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Even after downloading downloading Alexa app, she still has no idea where I live. Even with a full address, she can't find Grand Marais, MN! Junk Echo or junk app? Who knows, because they can't talk to each other.	3	January 29, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Microphone sensitivity is much improved over 2nd gen, but the output quality of the audio is overly muffled and muddy. Only gets worse at higher volumes. Adjusting in the Alexa app had virtually no effect.	3	February 4, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I bought an Amazon Alexa less than 2 years ago, and have suddenly started having volume issues with it. The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day.This started about 2 months ago. I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about. Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another echo device....that I'm now sure will just break down as soon as it's out of warranty.This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue (hardware or software, I'm not sure). But because of a policy shield, I'm screwed over. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could an issue like this be my fault?I expect these devices to last longer than a year and a half........ I'm extremely frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction.Buyer beware. This feels to me that Amazon knows its products will break down as soon as the warranty is up, screwing you over and banking (literally) on the assumption that you'll just continually buy new Alexa devices.	1	June 18, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Never got to use. Would not Pair with my iPhone	2	October 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Not responsive is the biggest issue. For example, asking it to ""snooze"" or ""lower volume or a higher volume"".I can stand within 4 feet in front of it and it doesn't listen.Love the quality of sound for music, but need it to respond."	3	January 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Good solid construction, heavy (in a good way) everything we have come to love by Alexia, but one big but the sound of Alexia voice is terrible. I am hard to offend but the sound is SO MUFFLED, it is to the point of distraction. What on the lovely green Earth were they thinking? I gave it one star only for the fact that it does work, but the sound is worse than bad, it is Terrible. It sounds like it is under a pillow. If you are thinking that it is not too much different than say, the first generation, you would be wrong. There is a case of back sliding here, I cannot understand why, I have a second one coming, ( I got it on a free promotion and it will sit on my shelf) I have a 1 generation show, several 1 generation Echo Dots and even though they might be considered ""old"" the sound is better than what I expected. I would send this back if I could."	3	November 21, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Cheap tinny sound makes listening to music an awful experience.  Luckily, the Echo Dot has an audio jack, which I used to plug into my Bose computer speakers for amazing sound.  If you have Apple Music, Alexa doesn't fully understand Apple Music such as playlists you have created.  It defaults to an artist's essentials playlist every time.  I shouldn't complaint too much since I got my Echo Dot for a penny with 1 month of Amazon Music, which I cancelled right away.  Apple Music is so much better.  Bottomline, I wouldn't pay full price for an Echo Dot.	2	April 29, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Can't get it to connect tired of trying need help Alexa Can't even help me...probably return product	3	April 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I received this as a free promo via SiriusXM. I was unsure about the alexa due to some things I have heard about it. The first couple weeks I had it I enjoyed it. Especially as I painted my room I could play music and change it up when needed. About three weeks after having it I muted the voice recognition because it would randomly tell me things or ask questions to my conversations.Then about 3 days later around 130 am I was in a deep sleep. All the sudden I was awaken too loud music. I jumped up turned it off, looked and voice recognition was still off. So i just figured it was a ""bug"". Went back to sleep and some time later it did it again. I unplugged it and has been unplugged since, unless I need music for cleaning etc.Maybe I just have not taken the time to get to know how to use it, but I also feel as though its not something i would really get into."	3	October 21, 2020	1

When that didn't work I was told to wait a few days and call back if it still does not work.  When called back they went through the same steps that didn't work the first time.  I gave up and bought another one.  Alexa is great as long as you don't have any problems with it."	3	September 24, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Need to research correct phrases or repeat or change request. Original volume to low. I did not learn on its own that Sirus Sixty on 6 moved to channel 73. Would not connect directly to the channel, had to make another choice another. My google device learned it. If it does not understand it automatically makes its own choice and just starts playing it without asking if I want this choice.	3	November 5, 2021	1
Echo Dot	First, I did adjust the Audio settings in the Alexa app (this is my 3rd echo) but no matter what it's so much bass & reverb, I don't use it as much.  Even when using as a Bluetooth speaker, I have to adjust the equalizer of the streaming device.  This echo must have been missed with QC, unable to return or exchange - this is will be the last echo I'll purchase	3	November 7, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I wanted a way to listen to music while my family and I cook and clean in kitchen. This product gets the job done, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the sound quality. It's supper muddy on the low end and doesn't have good dynamics at all. Especially when you turn the volume anywhere past the halfway point.Like I said, I don't need much and this gets the job done, but I just really wish it sounded better. It almost seems like I got a refurbished or used one that accidentally made it past quality control.I can't complain though because I got it as part of the 99¬¢ deal for being a first time amazon prime music subscriber. I would never pay full price for this device after hearing the sound quality.	2	February 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	She can't seem to understand that when I say Play Spotify Playlist (whatever) she plays (whatever) radio. Tried googling for the fix, but none of the advice has helped. Other than that, really enjoy it and want another one for a different part of my home.	3	January 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	what do you think about it A thief came to the house today. From the video, he saw that the thief didn't break in. He only said to open the door to the Alexa speaker at the door, and then the door opened.	3	January 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The sound quality of this particular Echo (our first Dot) is not as good as most of our other devices.	3	March 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	so i‚Äôve had this for a few months and i‚Äôve honestly loved the echo (bigger one) when i had one. i‚Äôve never had any issues until i bought this one. it is a pain!! if i‚Äôm not home for a few days (i travel often) or even tonight, it has issues connecting to the internet. tonight, i was playing music and using it all day, but now when i asked alexa to set an alarm there were connectivity issues. i‚Äôve called support and all they did was make me reset it, so i do it on my own. then i have to go in the app, delete it and reset it up. it‚Äôs honestly such an inconvenience and a drag. i can‚Äôt even just use it as a bluetooth speaker when this all happens so i‚Äôm forced to go through the whole process again. also consider, i have a roku 6~ ft away from the speaker that never struggles to connect to the internet as well as my laptop/phone, so i‚Äôm pretty annoyed and  i don‚Äôt even want to deal with it anymore.	3	July 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I don't honestly use alexa for much. I listen to pandora. It was a gift. Maybe if I took the effort to integrate my house, it could do more for me, but that isn't something I'm looking to do. It can't controll my smart TV. I can do stuff through my phone on alexa, but the things it can do are just easier on my phone than alexa. I have a Facebook portal (also a gift) that does similar things as alexa. Alexa does those things better, but I can't video call with alexa. I don't like how alexa will randomly think you called alexa while playing music or at other times. I don't like how commercials tell alexa to ask things, (like on pandora) and then alexa has to decide if alexa is going to do the things that came from the alexa speaker. The sound quality is pretty good. Not sure if it's better than the portal, though.	3	February 3, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"Having issues with voice recognition. Purchased 2 additional sets of smart light bulbs that are Alexa compatible. Found that using numbers to dimlights works best. Example ; Alexa dim light to 25%. .... We currently have 2 Alexa units in use. Microphone is a probable issue for the voice issue but I'm still experimenting with placement as a remedy. Example; One unit is on the floor in the hallway. A possible solution to the problem may be mounting on a wall. Also there is an issue when 2 units are in use. I have a intermittent problem when say one unit is playing music and the other is off. When I say Alexa play music everywhere the second unit will change the station I was enjoying. Like and technology this thing is mostly good but still has some bugs. The Alexa guard feature is basically worthless. It will only detect breaking glass to send to an alert. I've had maintenance people and myself inside the home when the guard feature is activated..... no alerts. So don't get a false sense of security if you rely on this a a burglar alarm. Overall the Alexa is like a ""clapper"" on steroids. A clapper is a switch from long ago that when you clapped your hands lights would go on and off. So basically this echo thing is a lot more than that. To make lights and appliances work you must have a smart plug of light. Lights can be purchased for about 12$ each. The light feature is nice as Alexa can change the light color. Alexa does get a passing grade but still not going to be 100% with the current generation."	2	January 16, 2020	0
Echo Dot	This product is the worst.  It simply does not work.  I have to leave a review because it has absolutely driven me mad trying to link it, trying to get it to play my Apple music, trying to get it to do the simplest things that its own instruction book tells you it should do.  So tired of Alexa telling me I don't know how to do that when it is as simple request as to turn on the newly purchased Smart TV that came with the very Echo Dot, all of which was paired multiple times.  Then, there's the Apple music pairing issue where on some days it works and on others not so much.  Prepare yourself pls.  You will go crazy trying to pair it and to figure out why in the Alexa app it shows everything as paired but there is Alexa telling you that you still have to pair it.  Over and over again you will lose sanity trying to get it to simply play a song right in front of you.  No way to override the madness and to shove the damn song down Alexa's throat so she will spit it back out at you to inevitably play the one song right there on the app.  And then there is the issue of telling Alexa to play an album only to have her play one song from the album instead of the entire thing an what seems to be a concerted effort to only play Amazon music.My advice whether this Echo Dot was free or $100 or $20 - don't do it.  Don't buy it.  Save your sanity.  Save your precious time that will be invested in fixing all the problems that will arise and suck you in so you can get this DUMB PIECE OF EQUIPMENT to work correctly.Horrible piece of crap doesn't really do it justice.  If it was free to me, I'd take a hammer to it.  That, truly, would give me joy right after Alexa tells me she doesn't know how to do something she's done a million times over.  THE HAMMER AND A QUICK BURIAL WITH THE BROOM AND A TRASH CAN.  That only would bring peace to this generation of Echo Dot.	1	December 15, 2019	0
Echo Dot	"I use the 3 Echo Dots to stream music throughout my home.  The Alexa app is easy to download, install, and use on all my devices.  The Eco Dot is simple to set-up through the Alexa app.  I know there are a lot of smart-home, personal scheduling, and other ways to use the Echo Dots, but my home is dumb, my schedule is ""retired"", and I am enjoying streaming music.Two days after I wrote this, I have had trouble with one of the Echo Dots deciding to disconnect itself from the internet and the grouping.  Reading the ""help"" instructions and multiple attempts to reconnect have failed.  I am not sure what to do now, and I don't have a child or teenager to go to for tech advice.Last addition to this review, I promise!  The Echo Dots and Alexa have minds of their own!  One day, everything works well, and the next day I am uninstalling, re-installing, and re-configuring everything. When they work together with Alexa, they are fantastic for music streaming."	3	June 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I wanted a second Echo for a different room (I have a 2nd Generation that I use for music daily.)  I do not have a smart phone so I could not download the app for set-up, so I intended to use my computer, like I did for the Gen 2.  I couldn't get the Dot to connect, so I contacted customer support.  The Amazon rep did a couple of things then said he couldn't connect the Dot because my computer had ""a ton"" of infections blocking the set-up.  He said he would clean out the viruses ""for free"", but I needed to have an anti-virus program installed.  He said the free anti-virus program I was using was not only useless, but actually part of the problem, and inferred that my current computer service tech was ripping me off.  He then wanted me to choose one of three anti-virus programs, one for $150, one for $250 and one for $400.  I don't like being pressured into making a decision, so I ended the call.  I contacted a completely different local service guy to come look at my computer.  He came and spent an hour checking my computer  and connecting the Dot.  He told me there were no viruses in my computer, and while the anti-virus program I was using was not the one he recommended, it was not a bad program.  After getting the Dot connected, I tried to get it to play music.  ""Alexa"" told me it would cost $9.99 a month to connect the Dot- I currently pay $3.99 for the Gen 2.  By this time, I was fed up, so I disconnected the Dot, repackaged it, and returned it for a refund.  One would think a company would make it easy to use their product, evidently that's not the case here."	1	September 2, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"I honestly really like this little thing. I got it in white and it looks very nice. Sometimes (and I mean really not too often at all) she'll mishear something and I'm not too frustrated as I know it happens to others as well. I dont have any complaints about the audio quality but I also didn't purchase this to fill my whole entire house with music. It does fill up an entire room though and that's enough for me when I'm relaxing at home. I do have one complaint and it's the only reason I am giving 3 stars. I'm not sure if I received a faulty product but whenever I ""drop in"" with my boyfriend he'll be trying to talk to me and when I answer, he says he can barely hear me. This is so strange to me because I can hear him just fine and Alexa responds to me even when I'm across the room, but for me to be directly over the Alexa Dot and for him to tell me that with his volume all the way up he can still barely hear me tells me that maybe something's wrong with mine? I'm not sure exactly and it's really strange to me. Also slightly disappointed about that. Other than that, I really like this dot."	3	September 9, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"For the $20 that I paid, it was a worthy purchase. Don't expect high quality sound, thumping base or adequate volume as you won't find it in the Dot 3rd Generation. It's adequate for use in a ""small"" bedroom, nothing larger."	3	December 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I took advantage of Prime Day to order this Dot speaker for $19.99.  I figured it would be worth it to try out Alexa without the expense of a pricier 4th generation version, especially because reviews have been so poor for the more expensive 4th gen Echo.  I'm disappointed because my Mom's cylindrical Echo speaker (I bought it for her in May 2020 and think it may have been 2nd gen) has such clear sound.  So we do use this speaker when we want to listen to some music while doing household chores.  But I hope the next generation Echo speakers have better, more clear surround-sound quality and not the directional sound that's garnering so many poor reviews for the 4th-gen speakers.	3	July 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I was excited, at my age, and looking forward to having a partial smart home.  I ordered the Echo Dot 3 gen (which I love even now) and two smart plugs to control two lamps...one in the bedroom and one by the front door.  The dot worked perfectly, plug it in and Alexa is ""in the house.""  The smart plugs would connect to the home network but no matter what we (Amazon Tech and myself) tried, the plugs would not react to the ""off/on"" commands.  The software would find the smart plug, install the drivers or whatever, but no reaction.  I was disappointed with the smart plugs only.  Please do not let my experience interfere with moving up a notch in the ""Smart Universe.""  This is probably an isolated incident and a possible something I overlooked in my network.  On top of it all, I lost my patience!  I wanted it to work out of the box.  I returned the entire package with reluctance.  Amazon is a great company for me.  I have never ever had to return anything before.  I personally realize there is no way back from the ""Smart Universe.""  By the way, the return was flawless."	3	October 28, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The speaker and sound quality aren't the best but works fine. I guess has more bass so when volume up, I feel like the speaker going blow. However, this is not the case why I only gave 2 stars. The reasons, I gave 2 stars because it is not safe to use. What I mean is that, if you have kids or someone who doesn't listen will use this echo dot to order stuffs and subscribed (music, movie  and etc.) to any paid that Amazon offers therefore before you know you have charged for stuffs that you didn't purchased or subscribed. There's no way to control it and can always be reset by anyone using.My kids were playing with and asking (jokes, music, and etc.) questions. After a week, I noticed that they subscribed to Amazon music which I didn't allow or authorized to do so. I also noticed that, they reset the echo dot and even though it is not reset anyone can control over just by talking to the echo dot. This echo dot can order and check on your orders which no privacy. There's no way to control this device. If you buying this echo dot to use as speaker then it fine but remember anyone using this device can access to your Amazon information.	2	May 9, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"Being that the Echo Dot is just a tiny speaker, relatively speaking, I didn't expect much from this device. However, we have 5 Dots in the house now and two of the five have just been nearly useless when it comes to two-way communication (Drop in feature). Given that the major reason we purchased these were for the drop in function, it leaves a lot to be desired. Of course, the sound didn't start to go bad until after the ""support window"" had expired so we're stuck with a bad device. Thankfully they are cheap, but don't expect to get a whole lot for your money. I don't know if there are any good alternatives, but I'll be looking to buy something higher quality than the Dots. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who wants decent sound quality."	3	June 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I have two DOTS and I have thought about scaling back to one, because the one in the distant room often responds before the one that is only 6' away from me does. One is in my Master and one is in my Kitchen (35' apart with two walls separating them). These units do not communicate with each other nor do they apparently understand that both should not answer a request at nearly the same time.I am thinking about finding a way to set the sensitivity if it is available, but if not, I will have to shut one down. Not terribly impressed with the technology and I HATE the MUSIC Catalog. I have the paid subscription, but only get Live versions, or duets on many of my favorite songs and I HATE live Versions or Covers and have NO ABILITY to set preferences or verbally get it to stop these things. I thought it was cool at first, but it is wearing off quickly after a year of these limitations.	3	September 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"We bought the ""ball"" echo dot but despite buying a new router could not connect it. Amazon wanted to remote into my computer to assist, despite claims they'd never make such a request. We returned it and Amazon worked with us to get the ""hockey puck"" dot for a good price. It connected in about 30 seconds making me realize the first dot was defective. So far, we're still learning its positives & negatives. Sound leaves a lot to be desired but I can't complain too much for a $20 robot. Trying to get it to play specific episodes of podcasts is difficult and we're trying to learn how to speak to Alexis."	3	July 20, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I bought this one to connect to my nest camera after researching that it can be connected. I was able to connect my Nest camera but realized that Alexa will not send alerts and notifications from Nest, which was a bummer. Otherwise this one does the job which it supposed to do.	3	December 7, 2021	1

Echo Dot	This device was working just fine and now it's been about a year and I'm having issues, she is not speaking up with my reminders or timers.I understand it's 2018 version, but if it's only going to last a year don't bother selling it.Ugggggg	3	December 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	this device is kind of lost on me. I don't really use it and as far as I know I have never played music on it. It seems to pick up sounds from the TV. One day I noticed a charge on my CC bill for $7.99 for Amazon Music, which surprised me since I didn't order it, have belonged to Prime for years, and usually listen to You Tube music videos anyway. But apparently Alexa deviously signed me up for a subscription I didn't even know I had. Luckily I check my bill. The same thing happened to a friend of mine.  This is a very devious way to line the pockets of Mr. Besos.  Imagine if they do that to every one who has one of these devices, and maybe 10% never even notice. Eight dollars a month times a million unknowing victims is a lot of money for nothing!	3	February 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Using the Alexa app with many of my lighting is very frustrating. We moved and so we had to use another Wifi box to connect to and its difficult to delete the old data/information and add new updated information from these apps to the Alexa app. She keeps telling me to go to the Alexa app for help, but there is no help for this issue. Ugh...Was okay for a while...After about a year I find myself yelling at Alexa because she cannot hear me properly. Both Alexa products we have seem to stop hearing us over time.	3	August 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I have 4 eco dots (3rd gen), 2 ecos and a eco subwoofer placed around my condo approximately covering 1,100 square feet. The products are amazing and the voice recognition is incredible. Various commands such as locking, unlocking the door, turning on TV‚Äôs and activating home security future makes this product very useful. One of the main reasons why I purchased these was to creat an all around surround sound theough out the house which is linked and operated through the app. The app has major opportunities. Linking all the speakers together through the Alexa app is a major challenge. You can link some per various rooms and/or linked them all together such as grouping the rooms. Problem is after a few tries they will link and you can play music in all rooms but once in a while the app will not recognize the links and play music in the selected group. In that case you‚Äôll have to go inside the app, delete all speakers from the app, re-add and re-pair which is a tedious task. Major opportunity with the software design which I‚Äôm hoping amazon can fix and update.	3	March 28, 2020	1

Echo Dot	So, less than 6 months ago I bought a 3 and a 4 for my home all has been going well up until about three days ago when dot 3 started making these really loud beeps and not responding to my voice. After running through all of the common troubleshooting steps and not having anything change I had to contact tech, and that's where the real fun begins.First, explain the issues then run through all of the same troubleshooting steps I've already done several times, not once but 3 more times, tech finally gives up puts me on hold for a bit comes back and offers a very low percentage off so I can replace a less than 6 month old echo. When I point out to her that according to my order view it shows that I can return it for replacement up to August 12 2022 she starts arguing about it, after requesting a supervisor not once but multiple times she finally gets one on the phone. When I point out that what I am seeing about replacement shows she sidesteps the issue and again offers a meager percentage off.So considering that they won't honor the replacement as indicated on my account, and the fact that this thing didn't last 6 months I can most certainly not ever recommend these things to anyone.This experience has left an extremely poor impression of not just the device but tech and customer service overall.	1	February 1, 2022	0

Echo Dot	This is my very first home device. The first couple of weeks were pretty smooth.  So, I purchased a second one.  Of which I now regret...  I set up and connected both devices to the Alexa app.  All was well until one day.... my scheduled reminders disappeared from the app.  I troubleshooted based on the instructions from Alexa customer service.  Nope...  Reminders were not restored.  But... Alexa is still reminding me!  This is the most annoying and frustrating feature.  I have reminders scheduled of which I cant delete because they are NO longer listed in the app.  I even googled this issue and its very common among other users.  They seek assistance only to receive an automated scripted response which does NOT work.  Honestly, Amazon took my hard earned money and ran with it.  Amazon is well aware of this issue and it seems the software needs an update.  How does that happen?  Not sure...  Anywho, I would NOT recommend.	2	October 18, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"If all you have are Amazon products, then this is going to be good.I own about 12 of these things, and individually, they work ok. You can add them to pairs, and that works ok too. You can even spend MORE money and buy a Subwoofer and that works too, but if you want to use them for ANYTHING ELSE (like as speakers for my Apple TV (or any other device that is NOT an Amazon Firestick (really Amazon? A Firestick?) They are absolute crap.The folks at Amazon can't seem to see past the end of their collective noses when it comes to usability. Why would I want to create a Stereo Pair that I can't connect to anything? No way to address it via Bluetooth, so if you want to connect an Echo to your Apple TV, you are only going to get ONE of these working. They have something called ""Studio"": requires a Firestick - which will NEVER happen.So, yeah they work. Not very well in terms of connectivity - lack basic connections. Can't even use a cord to connect to one of the speakers and get into the ""Stereo Pair"". Yay!  What gripes me most is I paid good money for this rubbish, and these morons will release yet another update and expect me to spend MORE money on more of the same shortsighted BS. Just love these companies whose only goal is to get your money."	2	August 5, 2020	0

Echo Dot	A.I. is not here yet. anyone familiar with programming will see this as IFTTT. I bought this device and a google home mini at the same time. The mini can still hear you at full volume while the dot struggles. The sound quality is better on the dot. I tried letting the dot recommend music. It was a disaster. it kept recommending the same stations over and over again. it was recommending top pop and clean alternative. I Don't want either of these stations. I tried disliking them and it kept recommending them. The only thing that it did that was A.I. like was after I cussed it more than I have anything animate or inanimate it just shutdown. I reset it and decided to use the amazon music app on my phone. I thought it may have been an issue with the app. The app had plenty of good recommendations so it was not the app. If you want something to turn your lights on this is a good device. If you want to explore new music this is not the device. You would think with all the data they have been collecting this thing would function better but it is not there yet.	3	November 10, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"I bought 4 of the Echo Dot Gen 3 and am greatly disappointed. My 78-year-old husband does not understand a word Alexa says because her voice sounds muffled like she's in a barrel.  We did not buy these for music, we bought them for the safety 'drop-in' feature that allows me to drop into the house whenever I'm away and make sure he's ok.  Changing the equalizer settings does nothing to improve the voice quality or lack thereof. I tried pairing them with blue tooth speakers and they all have the same lousy muffled sound, so it's not a defective unit.  Not only do we have a hard time understanding Alexa, but she does not understand our commands either.  We are getting tired of having to shout ""Alexa, STOP!"" when she starts playing some music that she thought we requested instead of answering our question.  By the way, sometimes she really does not want to stop playing whatever music she thinks we asked for, and we have to shout over and over, ""ALEXA STOP!"" Overall my experience with Alexa has been mostly frustrating.  I'm seriously considering sending them all back and just using our phones as a safety system."	2	July 11, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The device is fine I just did not realize you have to pay more for things. I got one for each of my kids and I can‚Äôt stream music at the same time	3	January 19, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I wish there was a way to lock the volume setting. My preteens like playing it as loud as they can and we have attached neighbors on both sides of us who are that happy about the noise. I go in and turn the volume down through the mobile Alexa app but the kids can just turn it right back up because there is no way to lock it. It would be very helpful for parents if that was a feature that was offered. We started with one echo dot and now have 3. I originally bought these so that when I leave my kids home alone for short periods of time they have a way to contact me since they don't have cell phones yet and they have worked great for that purpose. The kids love that they can set their own alarms and play their own music or soothing sounds at night.	3	January 7, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I actually ended up selling this to a friend so I can get something that isn‚Äôt Alexa. I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs iPhone interacts well with this, but mine sure didn‚Äôt.In fact, Alexa completely took over Siri to where I couldn‚Äôt even use her in my own house. This wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue if Alexa was even half as helpful as Siri. I‚Äôve never wanted something so badly and then been so disappointed. Nothing worked about the dot properly. I don‚Äôt understand the need for finding apps for simple things like how tall a celebrity is. My iPhone can do all of that so why can‚Äôt the dot? I am positive it really is some type of glitch with dot and apple because our friend who is an Android user was able to come right into our home and talk to Alexa without even pairing with voice recognition which I definitely did not like.All I know is I‚Äôm not getting rid of my iPhone so I guess I will be buying the apple version of this.	3	June 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I mostly listen to talk radio, and that's working well on this device. I also use it as an alarm and a timer. Thumbs up on those.HOWEVER, the ambient noise function for sleep is terrible! I actually prefer brown noise, and it starts off great. But then, it shuts off after less than an hour, no matter how long I set it for. Telling it to loop worked once or twice, then never again. I read that telling it to set timer for X amount of hours would work. And it did...ONCE. Last time I used it, it shut off after 20 - 30 minutes, and I told it to reset 8 times! Anyone who sleeps with ambient noise knows that it interrupts sleep if it stops. My research on how to solve that problem showed many other such complaints. So annoying!Also, Alexa subscribed me to the monthly Amazon Music subscription without my permission. Thank God I caught it soon after it happened. Customer service canceled it and told me how to disable it.I'd actually give it 3.5 stars for these reasons, but that isn't one of the optiions, so I gave it a 3. Fix the ambient noise option and I will give it 4.5 stars!	3	August 20, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I am not impressed. Alexa is cool. She doesn‚Äôt stay connected to WiFi. I have to hook up my personal hotspot to my computer and then have Alexa hook up through my computer. Every time I want to use Alexa I have to go through this process. When connecting Alexa it would not work I had to sit on the phone with a tech to finally get it to work. I have to go through this process every time I want to use Alexa. That‚Äôs not even the worst thing to me. The volume is so sad. I expected more I guess.	2	March 30, 2022	0

Echo Dot	"I use my Amazon/Alexa devices mainly for music and basic functions. I enjoy them overall but the mysterious static noises that happen are bothersome.**I've even heard the static when music is not playing.**There is definitely a static problem with these Amazon devices and Amazon can't seem to get to the bottom of this. If they have please let us all know.Overall I'm pleased with the sound, especially the ""whole home"" music connections. They're in sync and they do sound pretty amazing- most of the time.I'm also very used to and rely on the timer and reminder functions.***Reduced a star, Update: recently this Echo Dot, about twenty-five feet down the hallway in the bathroom, picks up my voice commands more often and consistently than my main Echo in the main room where I'm within 3 feet of it often. This is so annoying, especially for timers and Amazon shipping notifications as I end up missing those."	3	October 22, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Do not leave TV show that utilize an Alexa. If you are like me, you fall asleep easier with something playing on the TV in the background.

Echo Dot	With how popular these devices are, I‚Äôd expect them to be more simple to use. The device does not always play and must be frequently turned off and back on.

Echo Dot	I was given a Echo 5 Show as a gift.  I love it and went out and purchased another Echo 5 Show.  Thinking that everything echo is compatible, I went and purchased two more echo dots (3rd generation) to put in other rooms.  Things worked ok but when I purchased 3 more echo dots for the purpose of giving me stereo in all the rooms I began to have problems.  I have been unable to get stereo to work with the combination of a Echo Show and a Dot in the same room.  Tried a number of things without success.  Even just added a Dot to the room and made them both into a group but then the vol controls still work independently on each unit.  When I called Amazon support (who are really outstanding) they told me that I could only set up stereo if I was using the same units.  For example, I could use 2 dots and set it up or 2 Echo Shows but not a Show and a Dot.  I wish I had known this before I went out and purchased 3 more dots.	3	December 14, 2019	1

Echo Dot	This isn‚Äôt a review, I just wanna know if anybody else has experienced something like this: One night this week I asked my echo dot to open sleep jar, i had to repeat the question several times because my device was not responding to the command. After a few attempts it responded: ‚ÄúJust go to bed already.‚Äù I had a good laugh, gave up asking and called it a night. Now, the following night I asked the same thing, ‚ÄúEcho, open Sleep Jar‚Äù and what I got was: ‚ÄúDid you get enough sleep? Last night was bad.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt laugh this time. Today when I opened My Alexa app on my phone I noticed I had a new skill  called ‚ÄúSleep Time,‚Äù which of course, I did never enabled. Now, what I wanna know is... should I be concerned about this kind of responses from my device? Because it‚Äôs honestly making me uncomfortable.	3	December 11, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Horrible integration with their own Amazon music (unlimited subscription) app which can't cast to the device. Thought of using the cast feature because the bad recognition system doesn't understand what I'm trying to make it play in the first place. Alexa app is another level of stupidity. It has a play tab but you can't search from there and even can't play anything at times as it keeps crashing. Ridiculously buggy piece of software. Hardware is fine.	1	October 20, 2022	0

Echo Dot	"The learning curve is fast for the basics but takes a while to get all the right commands. Once you know how to use it, and of course, how to connect to all your equipment (took me a while to get my TV right), then you'll have a better experience.To get Alexa work at full power you need subscriptions, wireless equipment connected to what you want to control (power plugs, lights, TVs, soundbars, etc) If you don't have it, Alexa is a beautiful and expensive paperweight that sometimes you ask something.I got it with Prime audio unlimited. It is great until you don't use it every time because you have a lot of other stuff going on. And you have less money to spend in frivolities and the first things to go are subscriptions.In conclusion: If you have the money to spend in new tech (wait for BF) and then connect all your house, then Alexa will be your best friend. She can wake you up, transfer the sound from one place to other, turn on your coffee machine, TV, turn off the light... you'll be a spoiled person or a dependent one, pick your poison :)Alexa is just the first step for a touchless experience at home. It won't take much to all houses have one with all gadgets controlled by it. Or should I use ""HER"" !!! AI is beautiful. Better be friends with it... LOL"	2	July 10, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I'm giving this 3 stars because I feel like this picks up too much background noise when I'm trying to give it a command. Also, this may be my router's fault, but it seems to be disconnected from my internet every time I turn around and I feel like it should reconnect itself if there was ever an issue. I spent all weekend trying to get it to reconnect. The sound quality seems good, it's hard to get it to turn down if you have it playing loud since it seems to have trouble hearing your commands then. I wish I could fix the connection problem though because I do like the product.	3	July 5, 2021	1

Echo Dot	Need Subscription To Use üëéüèº	3	April 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have used the stand alone Google Assistant for over 5 yrs now and although had no need for Alexa I just received an Echo Dot for free with a FireTV purchase. I did not have any high expectations 'from Alexa' but had no idea how limited & inefficient, dyslexic, moronic, ... worthless it is. You have to ask twice, there is such a limited data it can pull from and other than weather and time it is mostly useless. With regards to using it to control the FireTV I have encountered many issues in Searching (giving results) of titles that exist but can not find. All in all, I have to return the FireTV too as its remote is basically useless. What a joke! Will return and never look back. The lesson for me has been: It is truly hard to go from driving a Cadillac (Google Assistant) to Ford Fiesta (Alexa), indeed!	1	August 1, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Poor voice recognition: it barely understands what I say, I usually have to repeat myself 2 or 3 times even when I am standing right next to the device.It is ""dumb"", compared to devices from competitors or just using a search engine. Rephrasing the question sometimes helps but it usually repeats the same dumb answer. You just get a result and it usually isn't the one you want. Sometimes the result isn't relevant at all. For example, if you ask: ""Alexa what is the score of the [sports team] game?"" it will almost never give you what you want on the first try.The sound quality for the price is bad, even bluetooth speakers that are half the cost of this sound much better plus they are usually wireless.The power brick is huge, it would be much better if it could accept a usb type C or even an old micro usb, but no luck. They have to give you an enormous proprietary power brick that is big and ugly.Sometimes when you get a notification, like when an Amazon package gets delivered, there is a yellow light on the device. So you say, ""Alexa, what is the notification?"" and it says something dumb like, ""look in your app to see what the notification is for"", it is unable to tell you. Not very useful.The best use case I can think of is for a someone with trouble seeing or trouble moving around, but for most people it is ultimately bad at this point in time."	2	February 5, 2020	0
Echo Dot	They work well for the first 5-6 months then the problems start. They start freezing up. I‚Äôve got 4 in my home and the first one I bought, in my living room, is becoming useless. I have to pull power and reset it sometimes several times a day because it just freezes up. I‚Äôm not gonna wait 5 minutes for it to turn on a light. Half the time I have to tell to get it‚Äôs attention. Not sure if they make hearing aides for these things. Trying to get it to play music over the whole house feature is a nightmare. Doesn‚Äôt even work by voice anymore. Have to do it on my phone, then the speakers shut off randomly. Now all of a sudden it stopped communication with my nest thermostat. I then uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it but now Alexa can‚Äôt even find it. Been trying for weeks. Overall all this device is supposed make life easier and instead it‚Äôs just frustrating. Way too many bugs. Giving serious thought to replacing it with another system.	3	April 13, 2020	1

Maybe more color options. #2... The voice... Again, more options. I want to name my Echo something else. I want her voice to sound different. Alexa sounds tired all the time. When in the app, it would be nice to create an avatar and allow the customer to choose who they want to talk to. Remember, it's interactive. Take it up a notch. Select personalities based on their choice of music. For example, let's say the customer is Jamaican and they like Cardi B. Maybe offer voice options similar to that style or sound of voice. #3... I think...""Alexa""... Should do her own introduction. She should walk you personally thru the app. The price should not increase for these added features & these kinds of changes should be able to be updated with customers who already have one."	3	August 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Everything is really great but when you compare Alexa with google , google is the beast if you have YouTube red it‚Äôs really great	3	January 28, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I was really disappointed with the volume. The highest was not high at all. Sounds like a cheap speaker.	2	August 24, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Love these things, have them in every room. Sadly the last two I bought have absolutely horrible sound quality, very distorted and rattles like the speaker is loose.  The integration with my other devices make the functionality pretty great overall.	3	December 2, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"My device came with a Fire TV and I thought it would be really nice to control the TV with it. Ha.My first device would not connect to my wifi network, even after trying all of the troubleshooting steps. I contacted customer service. After over an hour and a half with them, and three customer service reps, they told me that my device was defective because it never got an update in the factory and I needed to exchange it. They couldn't send me a new one because it never connected to their network, so I had to take it back to Best Buy.Got a second device...did the EXACT same thing as the first device. Despite starting the conversation with ""I had this problem before and this device is behaving the same"", I still spent over an hour on chat with customer service to be told that the device was ""defective and I need to return it to Best Buy"".I was going to give up at that point, but I had to pass near a Best Buy anyway so I gave it one more shot. Just plugged the third device in...same thing.I am a pretty tech savvy person. I set up and configured my wifi network myself...I should be able to handle this. But I cannot get one of these stupid devices to connect to my network, despite trying 3 different devices and spending 3 hours on chat with 5 or 6 different customer service representatives trying the same steps over and over just to satisfy their troubleshooting procedure. So I have plugged a Chromecast into my Fire TV and will control my TV with Google I guess. I'd return the Fire TV out of sheer annoyance with the whole Amazon smart interface if I was still within the return period. I expected better, Amazon."	1	August 22, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"What is the deal with Alexa these past 1 year or so???It doesn't recognize requests, volume resets itself, it can't find local establishments, doesn't ""hear"" - I have to repeat ""Echo..."" ALL the time, hears the incorrect request or direction, and it no longer recognizes routines! Don't know if it's just the 3rd gen, but my older version didn't have these issues!!The software needs to be changed, updated or something!! I wouldn't purchase another Alexa device until this is resolved!And from researching there are plenty of complaints in reference to the similar issues and/or more!!Get it together!!!"	2	March 11, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I had hoped to use these as an intercom system but I'm getting lost of feedback and quality is poor.  Maybe the 4th gen pucks would be better?	3	January 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Compared to the Google Home speaker the Alexa is much darker sounding and not as loud. That being said all the other qualities of the speaker are fine.	3	January 17, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Recognition of accents is poor, runs in circles.	3	March 27, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I put three of these in my house. It seems like sporadically they go off-line and my Internet is just fine. Not as happy as I thought I would be with the items	3	December 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	my first Alexa device. Got it in Black Friday sale. Have not really explored it's capabilities, use it to monitor Ring doorbell. Will update after I have opportunity to test it out fully.	3	December 29, 2021	1
Echo Dot	sound quality is better than gen 2..has a fuller sound (more bass).So, its somewhat better, just not any revelation. No ah-ha , no omg, just ok.worth the discounted price.No difference improvement in voice recognition noticed.	3	December 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Had it for a year and then all of a sudden it just quit working, no reason just stopped.  Went to the Alexa website...what a mess that is!  It's impossible to find ways to troubleshoot or fix the problem...no way to reset it.  I have no idea how to fix it.  I guess they don't want you to fix it...they make more money when you have to just keep buying more.  Online customer service is nonexistent.	3	August 31, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This supposedly indispensable helper is annoying. While it is handy for turning on lights, it responds annoyingly to the TV.  Could certainly do without this device	3	January 19, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I wasted a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my ECHO device connected to my 5g wifi internet. After some research, some online forums suggested splitting my 5g internet (to 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands) to try to get the ECHO to connected. That did not work either. What a waste of time and money. Amazon needs to provide an update to my ECHO device so that those of us with 5g can connect it. Now I just have a paper weight.	1	October 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"The Alexa devices do a lot of cool things, but they also have a lot of annoyances. For example, there are at least two songs on Spotify and a playlist I have set up on Spotify in which the word ""grey"" is spelled correctly - with an e. Alexa can't ever find them and ends up serving up some really bizarre alternatives. This would all be fine if there were any way to train or program Alexa devices/ This is just the most immediate example of the larger problem, which is that there doesn't seem to be any way to make Alexa understand individual preferences. There is no simple way to say, ""No, Alexa, that's not right. Do X instead.""Calling, the actual reason I bought the first device, is nowhere near as simple as in the commercial with the woman who burned the duck and calls dad for a recipe. I'm able to call out using the Echo Dot, but when I try to answer an incoming call, it tells me there is no incoming call. Calling my mother, for whom I bought an Echo Show last Christmas, has never happened - it just rings her phone.On a hardware issue, the power source is a big square that doesn't fit well on a power strip or the plug in a wall outlet. When used with a standard wall outlet, the square is too big to allow the second outlet to be used. When used in a typical power strip, it blocks both outlets next to it and the outlet across from it."	2	December 29, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Like everything else Amazon, this has gone from best in class to low class trash. I have nearly a dozen echos, dots, shows, etc. Have loved them all until recently. Now I am absolutely ready to trash every one of them. I don't need suggestions and advertisements every time I turn on a check the weather, check my calendar, add to my lists, or turn on a flipping light!!! I am very easy going. You want analytics? Fine. You can collect all my usage info. If recording me in the bathroom will make Alexa better then hear me roar. I get that these things have a lot of back-end costs for the servers, constant development, etc. I don't mind paying a reasonable subscription to pay for the service. What I will NOT stand for is to be force-fed all these suggestions and ads every time I interact with Alexa. Turn it off or I am done with it.	1	July 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Does NOT let you finish the question before answering.  We all already have at least one of these, in real life.Answers not the best, because she does NOT listen 1st.Send back !	3	December 14, 2021	1
Echo Dot	No commands for YouTube or any other famous platform. Also if disconnect the echo for some days it will start working poorly	3	February 5, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Sound quality is poor. But it's just fine for a small space like the bathroom or for just for easy sound to go to sleep.	3	January 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"The setup instructions do not focus on initial setup. There is too much distraction with""bells and whistles""Who cares about creating a shopping list if you find connection to the wifi a BIG hassle.It does not have to be this hard.Re-write it so it makes sense to customers."	2	June 25, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I am surprised by the positive description of the sound that I read in reviews.  In my opinion the sound is awful, even considering the small size.  It is muffled, boomy, and without clarity; certainly not suitable for classical music. I haven't kept it long enough to have an opinion on voice recognition, Alexa, and so on.	1	November 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"The device itself is fair: it does get the vocal instruction wrong about 10% of the time - but outside of that it pretty much performs as expected.  The app however, is another issue. The home screen is messy, and it's hard to get to the items you really need.  Worst of all is the shopping lists: they're tricky to get to, and Amazon removed the ability to text a shopping list to someone: now, it only send a link that can access your Alexa app: definitely NOT a good idea, and very frustrating: makes the shopping lists largely useless.  They really buried the awful ""Amazon Sidewalk"" selection, so if you're not careful your home network will be connected to your neighbors networks without your approval."	2	January 17, 2022	0
Echo Dot	You have to be pretty close by or speak loudly for it to understand. And speak very clearly. At max volume 10, it will fill a small room. It‚Äôs quite useful to fill a sound gap between 2 other Alexa devices.	3	November 30, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"This device seems to have loud audio announcements which I cannot disable. I got this for 1$ if I remember this correctly. But, even then, given the hassles of bluetooth disconnecting and reconnecting multiple times and loud announcements being made multiple times (Even in the night), I would easily rate it at 1 star. But, given that I am a nice person, I am rating this with 2 stars (even though the device is not worth it). There is no 3.5 mm input audio jack for this. The ""skills"" of Alexa might be limited and the voice recognition works only for common sentences like ""what time is it"" or ""what temperature is it"". Ok. I am exaggerating. Honestly, it is not that smart. Alexa can get confused between ""what time is it"" and ""what temperature is it"". And then, sometimes, I get the temperature of some other city of some other country when I ask for the time of my city.And, ""one last thing"", this one makes lots of noise when I am having business meetings, if I happen to disable the audio microphone of this device."	2	September 2, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I love being able to tell it to play a certain musician or just a station.	3	February 18, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The functionality is fine, but the speakers sound muffled.  It's in exactly the same spot as my 2nd Gen was, and it definitely has less sound quality than my 2nd Gen did.  Sounds like it's under a blanket.  I've done all the recommended troubleshooting, it's just not as clear.  I know I can add external speakers, I just shouldn't have to.  Otherwise, it works just as well as the 2nd Gen	3	September 7, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I've had more problems in a week with a Dot than in 2 years with Google Home. I bought one for myself and one for a friend. She keeps having to unplug/replug the Dot so that drop-in doesn't give me the message ""XXX is not available."" I had to restart mine to be able to make phone calls. The only reason I don't give it a single star is that the aux jack allows me to connect and stream music to me audio system, but even then Amazon limited the jack to miniplug rather than both that and TOSLINK. So far it's a stinker, and it's already on to 3rd gen.Each time I stream from an iPhone after a lull, Echo announces, ‚ÄúNow playing from iPhone.‚Äù This can happen many times a day. It is idiotic and unnecessary. (Amazon support confirms that it works this way.)Many times when I say ‚ÄúHey, Google,‚Äù the Echo wakes up and listens. This is an unacceptable privacy intrusion, and cause to question Amazon‚Äôs motives.Now when I ask what song is playing it responds by telling me it‚Äôs a great kitchen companion, blah, blah. Junk ads.Update: Right now, it is stuck in perpetually playing podcasts. I told it to play one, which it did, but now it keeps playing past episodes of the same podcast. It ignores my instructions to stop. Even if I use the phone app, it then plays two podcasts at once rather than ending the first. I‚Äôll have to unplug the device. This is one buggy product.Outgoing caller ID won't display and customer service can't make it work after 40 mins, so I keep using my Google Home for calls. If you send feedback using Echo you have just a few seconds or it stops responding. I have to give info to Echo much faster than I do to Google Home, so I often have to repeat myself.Be aware that this product has just a 90-day warranty."	1	December 29, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Device works well and does what you want it to do, but configuring WIFI is a complete disaster and took me several hours.  All amazon devices get creative on WIFI settings, and my Echo Dot only wanted to connect to 5g networks from the access point farthest away from it (and through multiple concrete walls (which 5G signals dont travel through.  So i ended up having to make a new SSID that is only broadcast on my 2G network from the closest access point.  Then i had to add the Echo's MAC address to a blocked list for my main SSID (because even after connecting the Echo to the new SSID, it would default itself back to the main SSID - and there was no way to make only the echo device forget the main network.  This then got my connection up over 200 mb (vs Alexa's preferred network at 5mb).  After all that, i made sure to make the new SSID isolated from the rest of my network because who know why it wants to be on the other one so badly	3	December 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"I have changed my rating 2-3 times and every time i am removing one start as i found a new problem.Slows down .have to reset it frequently. It will work fine for few weeks after resetting but later on it will behave like weird(like a teenager). You will keep on shouting alexa and it won't listen OR it will and the lights would glow but then it won't execute the commands you just said which are usually pretty basic one as alexa isn't smart like google.You will have to do the same process twice or thrice sometimes . Accent should not be an issue here because it will work fine even if you shout ""alexa/echo"" while eating provided it was rosetted few days ago.Few times i had also noticed that the lights would turn on even if you are not saying anything. It seems it looses its ability to figure out the word(alexa/echo) from the sound it's getting as it's constantly listening and processing those sounds.One of the weirdest thing came up when i paired with my laptop . My laptop's sound card wasn't working so i connected this one with bluetooth . It works fine when you're playing something . Weird part is it will randomly notify you ""Playing from <Computer  Name>""  multiple times during the day until it's disconnected . This freaks me out specially when i am working and laser focused  and there's pin drop silence and this bloody thing shouts ""Playing from ..."" . I want to meet the PM who thought this feature was a good idea and then never tested it. I want to try the same thing he/she was on so that i can come up with this kind of out of the box ideas during my meetings .Also , why HERE Maps ? who's using it ?"	1	June 21, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The product looks great in my room for a modern feel and being used primarily as a speaker for music. Alexa technology could use some extra work to perfect in picking up on words spoken. Also, the constant advertisements for upgrading to Music Unlimited and other items is annoying.	3	November 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I so enjoy it will keep track of my shopping list. I am unhappy about answers. I ask questions and it just doesn't know which is frustrating. I did receive this as a gift so the family can stay in touch. Love that I can call from Alexa anyone on my contact list. Don't like the fact I tried sending a message through it that it went to both my daughter and son in law, but was ment for her. I'm still getting used to it. I was thankful I could change its name. But having only three options was disappointing. I would have liked to put my own name to it but oh well. It is frustrating trying to figure what it can do, could use better instructions but that is my opinion	3	March 9, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I bought an echo dot years ago and it is far superior to this.	2	September 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	This thing sucks. You can't just simply use it as a bluetooth speaker. You can only listen to music through their app and with specific providers (Sirius, etc.) I connected it with my phone and wanted to listen to music on YouTube, NO LUCK! You can only listen through the app and their lame list of providers. I'm not paying for Amazon music. Unless you are too lazy to turn the lights on and off or push a button on the remote, this thing is useless. I got it for free with a Fire TV and you can't even use the speaker with the Fire TV, only to change the channels or turn the power off. That's what the remote is for. This thing is lame as F.  Again, I got this turd for FREE!!! A bluetooth speaker that cannot simply be used as a bluetooth speaker. I put this POS back in the box and kicked it across the room, literally. Then I went and got my 5 year old Amazon Basics bluetooth speaker and was listening to whatever I wanted with ease. It doesn't make me go through some BS app, it just connects and works!!! Amazing!!! Maybe some people are looking for voice activated everything, I just wanted a bluetooth speaker that worked like all the others. This ain't it.	1	February 11, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I bought a 2nd gen echo a while back and have been getting good use out of it.  When I saw these on sale for $19 I figured I could add them around the house.  I wish I had gone with the regular Echo instead of these dots.  The Echo doesn't sound great because it's not stereo, but size matters.  It is still far superior to these dots in sound quality.  These Dots also don't hear as well as the full size Echos.  I find myself having to repeat my simple commands quite often with the dots, never with the full size Echo.  And that is my biggest complaint.  I understand sound quality, it's hard to get good sound in a package that small.  But I hate having the repeat myself when Alexa doesn't hear me.	3	December 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Little did I know that Amazon only allows one echo to stream at a time from my Amazon prime. I don't use it enough in the basement to subscribe to their music pay service.	3	December 16, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I really expected this to have fantastic sound quality but it sounds like an old speaker. It doesn't make for enjoyable listening to anything. Bought this for 99 cents on a special with buying Amazon music so at least we didn't pay full price or I'd be sending it back. We have used it two, maybe 3 times at most in a month. Our phones have far superior sound. Very, VERY disappointed. I would not buy this again and would not recommend this to anyone.	1	October 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	STOP! Wait before you buy!I have 2 of these 3rd Gen Dots and while one works okay, not great, the other one is useless and both were setup the same. While the voice recognition works great, the intelligence level is surprisingly poor. The app you have to use to setup the device is very misunderstood and could use a more friendly user interface. The app requires you to have a cell phone (not surprised) to use the app. The interface for the devices it can control is morbid to say the least. It's a hit and miss on the recommended devices as far as availability and prices. And then when you do finally get the devices Echo Dot can control, it's a constant love and hate affair with installing them. I love to listen to music and have linked my favorite radio stations. The Den Echo Dot will playing music very well but refuses to amaze me with facts that I already know. The second ECHO Dot is stationed in the garage in which I diligently use to track lists partial to my hobby but cannot for some reason play music of any kind. My conclusion is, Amazon has a long way to go before I will purchase another one of these useless contraptions. They may be great for the younger generation to listen to music or chat-chat with their friends but I am NOT impressed at all!	2	July 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Super finicky. Kids mode should be personalizable. I have to manually turn it on/off or rather just leave it off so my kiddo can do her thing. Just give us an option to lock it between hours and more options for things it can do/not do.Example- ‚Äútell me a story‚Äù after our story time is done or playing sounds on sleep jar is fine but the device ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know about that‚Äù when kids restrictions are on. But it can play music all dang night just fine (by being prompted). If I could get it to play sleep jar sounds from the app I‚Äôd be less annoyed but the kids restrictions should not be ‚Äúone size fits all.‚Äù	2	January 26, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Now that our country has fallen to a Communist regime it is still Reasonable to believe that Devices such as these can be used to spy on people.My concerns could be lessened if Alexa allowed for more conservative and religious content. Also it would be nice if Alexa wasn't always trying to hustle money out of you. Like all technology, it is how Alexa is used or abused that makes the differance.	3	September 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I love what these things can do, but  I‚Äôve tried three different models and the sound was only decent on 1 of them. The echo fourth generation with premium sound did have decent sound but in four hours I had to reboot it three times. At times I‚Äôd be standing right next to it and had to call out Alexa several times before it would answer. I‚Äôve sent 2 back, now I have the echo hockey puck. newer model, The sound on that is so muffled at times I can‚Äôt understand it. Very disappointment.I‚Äôve decided to just keep it but I‚Äôve also decided never to order another Alexa product. Not only because of sound quality but because they have run out of options to trySo very disappointed because I really wanted to like these.Amazon you did a great  job with these things. I see all the good reviews and wonder if it‚Äôs possible that I just got 3 bad units. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely.I read somewhere that Amazon will cancel your account if you return things too many times. I don‚Äôt want to take that chance, so again I‚Äôm keeping this little hockey puck and sadly will use it for a paperweight.	2	March 4, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"Max volume isn't as loud as a Bluetooth speaker I have, and there's really no bass. Also has to be plugged in constantly to work. I guess I assumed it would charge and I could transport it around my apt to use without unplugging and replugging it in. And I'm not sure if there's a way to get the light to stop circling the top when it's in standby. I said, ""Alexa power off"" but the light kept going. Seems wasteful an unnecessary and was kind of annoying as it would catch my eye while I was trying to watch tv. Other than those things, I do enjoy having the freedom to call out whatever songs I would like to hear, or questions I would like to ask, instead of having to mess with my phone."	3	February 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The product is great for some things but am very disappointed in the sound as it is muffled.	3	February 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This came for free with something I purchased. I never had any desire to buy one, but thought I would try it for free. I have tried to find a use for it, but so far it is a paperweight. My TV has SiriusXM, so I don't  need this for music. I don't  possess, or need, smart devices, so I don't need this to control them. My tablet gives me more options for answers to questions and is easier to understand. And I don't trust something sitting there listening to me all day. So I really have no use for it. Until someone gives me a good reason to use it, I am just letting it sit there turned off and collecting dust. I gave it two stars for not being ugly and for being free.	2	December 13, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I was hoping that the quality of the speaker in the echo dot would have improved by the third generation, but it hasn't. If you're a little hard of hearing (like my husband and me), it is very difficult to understand what Alexa is saying.	3	November 5, 2021	1

I just got tired of explaining the same problem over and over again, being told to do the same that the previous rep told me to do. I've followed all of the directions that I was instructed to do multiple times with the same outcome.  I do appreciate each and everyone that tried to help. Naresh was especially helpful. she was so patient with me and stayed with me. I don't think I'll be purchasing any more amazon devices. Nothing should take over an hour to resolve. once I finally paired my laptop to the Echo, that is where the location was wrong. That just didn't make any sense, they were not paired."	2	November 2, 2021	0

Echo Dot	After speaking with Amazon reps about the failure of our Panasonic blue-tooth phone system to meet our needs, it seemed that the Echo Dot might be the perfect solution.  We are unable to get a landline working in our new home and had hoped to find something that would allow us to answer our cell phones or make calls without having to carry our phones from room to room.  The Echo Dot has great voice recognition and the sound quality has been clear as a bell, both of which are a major improvement over our former bluetooth system.  But, the only way Alexa can find our phones is if they are in close proximity to the Echo Dot.  So, once more, mission unaccomplished.  We are keeping one Dot to take advantage of its other features, but are returning the second that we bought to be able to access our phones from our second floor.	3	July 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Definitely not great with voice recognition. I‚Äôm bilingual and live in the south so I hate having to use a specific accent (very basic American accent) just to get Alexa‚Äôs attention. Also it would be nice if she only listened to me and not everyone else in the room. If someone is talking about their experience with Alexa and the voice recognition she will sometimes pick up on their voice and they aren‚Äôt meaning to get her attention. Overall the sound quality for the space I use it in is good but the point was for it to be hands free now also adding I don‚Äôt want to have to yell at Alexa like a crazy person to get her attention lol it‚Äôs ridiculous.	3	May 13, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I think it‚Äôs a neat concept. It just doesn‚Äôt consistently respond appropriately. For example: doesn‚Äôt always turn tv on and off, doesn‚Äôt always open apps on my Fire TV as requested l, had unrelated responses to search requests, etc. I love being able to use it at night to turn the rain sounds back on, but it inconsistently leaves the notifications light flashing (yes, I‚Äôve used the Alexa app to disable this feature). Sometimes I have to just unplug it.  Also, it may be a feature of Alexa through FireTV versus Alexa Dot, but I will have used Alexa Dot voice command to open Audible and it will not do it correctly or it will suddenly drop me out of one app and unexpectedly open Audible and start playing a book!	3	March 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I was a very early Amazon Echo adopter. I had the first Echo in my home as soon as it was available. Like many users, this was my entry into home automation. In the beginning, it was all good. The voice recognition was perfect, and it only did what I asked. Over the years as the devices grew to be more ""intelligent"", the voice recognition has gotten far worse and Alexa now talks to me on its own whenever I give it a simple command. ""By the way..."" she says after, ""Alexa, turn off all the lights"" and then I get info on how to play scrabble with the dot in my bedroom when I am trying to go to sleep. These ""By the way..."" moments have become more frequent and lengthy. It's at the point where anything I ask Alexa to do, I am misunderstood three times, then on the fourth time I am understood and she says ""By the way, did you know...."" and talks at me for what feels like 5 minutes. It has gotten so bad that I unplugged and sold all of my Echo devices on eBay because the trade-in prices here are a joke.In fairness, the audio and video quality as well as the physical quality of the device itself are incredibly high. This is entirely an artificial intelligence and software issue. Alexa has become intrusive, no way will I allow these things to tell me what I should be doing."	1	November 28, 2021	0

Echo Dot	The speaker is weak. Sound quality not what I was hoping for. I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs purpose beyond it‚Äôs a speaker.	3	January 17, 2022	1
Echo Dot	la verdad no vale mucho la pena sino la vas a usar con dispositivos tengo mas de 4 meses us√°ndola y casi nunca responde bien alas preguntas que le ago tambi√©n eso depende del pa√≠s en el que te encuentres donde vivo aun no esta muy actualizada para trabajar bien, lo que menos me gusta de cuando le pregunto algo es que dice no lo se eso me molesta bastante por lo √∫nico que vale la pena comprar la es para controlar dispositivos ya que tengo enchufes y bombillos y cuando le digo que los prenda y los apague los prende de una vez pero creo que tienen que optimizarla mas como una asistente personal tambi√©n creo que le tienen que poner mas nombres algo que me gusta de ella es que cada vez que le pregunto una suma, resta, divisi√≥n, multiplicaci√≥n etc siempre las responde correcta mente tambi√©n me gusta que siempre me avisa cuando llegan mis pedidos.	3	July 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I can be listening to an audio book, music or on a call and it just shuts down? Weird!!!	3	January 31, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I've been wanting whole-home surround sound for years now and researched so many different wired systems and was super excited when these devices came out, it seemed to be the answer to my audio problem.  I quickly purchased 2 Echo Dot (3rd gen), 2 Echo Inputs, and 2 Plugs...hooked them up, created my speaker group and it worked great for like the first month or so.  I synced my SiriusXM acct and was stoked to finally listen to my Xmas music throughout my house, upstairs, downstairs and basement.  Then the issues started...one device would play, the others wouldn't...then they would all play together and then stop.  I connected, reconnected did all the troubleshooting things you're supposed to do.  I googled for answers and found the same syncing issues with using SiriusXM, but I had issues with Amazon music too!  These are THE MOST FRUSTRATING DEVICES ever!!  If they worked liked they're supposed to, it would be awesome, but alas...they don't!  Sometimes they play together, but most times the don't.  I can play one device at a time, but if I try playing Amazon music on another device, it won't allow it without a family account or something.  If the dumb speaker groups would actually play, this wouldn't be an issue.  I've researched forever and you'll find lots of reviews with these same syncing issues, you'd think Amazon would address it instead of just having them on sale all the time....arrrggg.  PLEASE FIX THE SYNCING ISSUES AMAZON!!!	2	December 3, 2019	0

Echo Dot	Good product. Speaker was less than perfect for music. Speaker actually blew in one of ours. Worth it to have around for little Alexa things, not worth it for music	3	December 23, 2021	1

Echo Dot	Everything worked. It was brand new. I used it a few times to read a book and listen to music. I use other devices way more so I haven't even charged this in months.	3	December 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Poor sound quality, especially on bass, which sounds weird, I switched back to 2nd gen even it has no bass	3	January 19, 2022	1
Echo Dot	We already have a few 3rd Gen Dots in our house and they have always worked perfectly (not the greatest sound quality but they work perfectly).  This makes it easy to stream music to all of the Alexa devices at the same time.  Incidentally, we also have a Show and a Spot which both work just fine too.  I recently purchased two new Dots on sale from Amazon...  I spent a week trying to get them to work to no avail.  They just drop out when playing music after only 1-3 songs.I went nuts checking my internet and wifi signals everywhere...  our wifi coverage is all great.  Next, I moved on to just testing an old Dot in its usual place for an hour...  worked perfectly streaming music.  Then replaced it with a new Dot in the same exact location...  it would drop out to silence within 1-3 songs.  Put the old Dot back in place...  worked perfectly for an hour.  I did this with both Dots in multiple locations and the two new Dots consistently failed.  It was clearly the new Dots that had some defective component in them.I've returned the two Dots.  The return process was a nightmare as well.  I wanted to exchange these for new ones but I had to wait on a call from Customer Service...  I couldn't just check off an exchange on their returns page.  They insisted upon talking to Customer Service...  the page indicated they would call within 10 mins or so...  I waited two hours...  no call.  In the end, I have opted to return for a full refund instead.When I purchase the last 2-3 Dots that I need to complete the home, if I get one more defective unit, I am done with the Echo line.  I'll toss them all in the garbage and purchase another brand.  This problem has wasted far too much of my time.  Amazon's exchange procedures were impossible to use too.	1	September 7, 2019	0
Echo Dot	It doesn't understand my voice but I bought it for my daughter and it understand her. Sound quality is excellent.	3	January 17, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Kind of cool but also very annoying. Doesn't work right half the time. If you're power goes out randomly at night, Alexa resets and turns all the lights on. For being so smart this device lacks a lot of simple things, like the ability to sense power surges or listen to clearly spoken words. Yell her to turn off my TV and the device is not working properly, check your power supply. Tell her to turn of my WINDOW and she powers down the TV. AMAZON, y'all sold this? Works to tell the weather, play music, and work the lights in the house (sometimes). Wish I would have bought 1 not 4. I thought they would be better than this. A $50 dollar tablet can tell me the weather and play music plus some. Hopefully Alexa will get better. I'm considering taking mine offline and selling them. Time will tell but lately I've been SUPER DISAPPOINTED with my Alexa.  Especially with the power outage situation. If I were Amazon I'd work at fixing the current bugs in Alexa more so than focusing on making it talk like Samuel Jackson or other stuff.	3	September 27, 2019	1

Echo Dot	Its a good product but I honestly dont use it the way it probably should.

Echo Dot	Debes pagar suscripciones para muchos servicios √∫tiles en este artefacto y si no, bueno podr√°s escuchar m√∫sica que no te encanta!	3	January 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The Alexa system is very awkward for listening to podcasts. Compared to the Google Home it falls very short. For example one very useful feature on the Google product is the capability to skip forward or backward within a podcast. This is not possible on Alexa echo. More generally the Alexa seems to be even more of a vehicle to try to get you to subscribe to various premium music services. This is something it shares with Google Home, however it is much more blatant on the Alexa. On neither system is it possible  to upload your own music to an account so that you can listen to it on your smart speaker using voice commands. You have to connect via Bluetooth with your phone or tablet and play the song files thereon over the smart speaker, which sort of defeats the whole purpose of having a voice activated device.	3	August 13, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Keeps wanting me to sign up for Prime, and charge me, when I'm already a Prime member. When I ask if I'm going to be charge for playing a song she ""don't understand"" then goes silence."	3	November 19, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Sometimes it lags im not sure why i have 2if one lags so does the other	3	February 4, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Very good reminders are good routines are good alarms work but my last echo device could play specific songs but this one, when I say for it to play a certain song it just says ‚ÄúPlaying specific songs is only available with Amazon music unlimited, here is a station based on (the song name).‚Äù And it just plays random song related to it and does not play the actual song you wanted.	3	September 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The speaker blew out after a year and a half. Didn't have it on max volume either.	3	January 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Too much personal information required and put at risk. Also, it is useless without paying for subscriptions to paid services. Without subscriptions, it is nothing more than another exposure of personal information and technology crutch for people relying on technology to do even the simplest things in life.If I had not been given one the day I started working for Amazon; which I quit after 3 weeks due to life and work related reasons with the company operations towards employees/employment, I would have never purchased nor tried it out. Disconnected and setting in the unused items room.	2	March 4, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Very annoying how it wants to suggest features almost every time you use it.Ex:Me: Alexa play ""insert song name here""Alexa: playing ""song name"" on Amazon music. Did you know, you can listen to all of your favorite songs on Amazon music? Just say play a song.""...... I already have Amazon music. I don't need an ad for it. Same goes for suggesting jokes, routines, features, etc when I say something simple. Sometimes less is more. If rather just Google it on my phone."	1	September 21, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"While my initial thoughts were more positive.. I was excited to purchase and use my Echo Dot 3, but, I have since become highly disillusioned and disappointed that absolutely NONE of the Amazon Alexa App screens downloaded to my Samsung smart phone look ANYTHING like the screens shown anywhere online or in any YouTube tutorial video.  And even when I go to the ""Feedback/Help"" screen, it says ""Tap on this or Tap on that"" ‚Ä¶ Most of which are NOT showing up on MY app screen.  Basically, the ONLY instructions you get are ""Download the app and follow the on-screen instructions for setup""...  If those instructions and/or features are not showing up... It's getting more and more frustrating every time I try to do anything more than simply ask ""Alexa, What time is it?""............  I never expected trying to use this Echo Dot 3 was going to be such a treasure hunt just to FIND the features.  Still cannot understand WHY my downloaded app looks nothing like the photos of the app online...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..."	3	January 14, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I really got this product beacuse i got a code in woch i only had to pay 5 bucks. I wont complain beacusr for 5 bucks its great.

Echo Dot	Alexa is annoying and stalking but when you need to ask her a question she is pretty fine	3	January 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I only bought this for two reasons.  It was cheap on Prime Day and I wanted to see if it was any different sounding than my other Dot 3rd Gen.  It wasn't.  The music quality is pretty good for its size, but if you use it a lot for news, audiobooks, and feedback from Alexa, the voice quality is horrible.  There are pages of complaints about this issue on the Amazon forums, but no fix from Amazon.  My older echos have much clearer voice than the 3rd gens.  So now I know why they discounted these and hopefully the 4th Gen version corrected this with the front firing speaker, even if they do look hideous.  However, I do not plan on investing any more money in echos, until I know they have actually corrected this flaw.	3	October 16, 2020	1

Echo Dot	This echo dot has given me fits.  She can't understand what I'm saying to her no matter how many times I say it and be sure I'm speaking clearly.  I'm close enough that is not the issue.

Echo Dot	At first my echo dot was great and for the first week, no problems. But one day I was listening to music when all of the sudden Alexa stopped played music and just started whispering over and over again, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill you‚Äù I have no idea why or what prompted it but I was terrified. Alexa wouldn‚Äôt respond either so the only way to stop it was to unplug the echo. Yeah so now it happens every so often and I refuse to plug in at night or when I‚Äôm alone just because I feel like it knows when I‚Äôm alone and when to say it. Literally the scariest thing ever.	2	January 21, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Dear Amazon,I was not sure what I was getting with Alexa if I spelled correctly. My first questions were to play Beatles songs as I named a song and every time I did the devise wanted me to make a purchase. I then was told by my brother to be more general and was in my questions and got some music as the 1st song was a Beatles song and other songs not. I did for a long time ask questions and got none disconnected chord and hit the stop button and forth. This has been a learning experience for me. I detected a negative tone in the voice of Alexa also at one point.I am still learning.Respectfully,Mark Nagell	3	March 15, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"Alexa is very good for some things, but it has limitations.  To get some songs, such as the Beatles' ""Old Brown Shoe,"" it requires a $3.99/month fee.  It won't play some songs or plays the versions I don't want.  I find it extremely difficult to get it to play some classical music.  For example, Mozart's 12th serenade (K.375) is my favorite piece of music, and I can't figure out how to get Alexa to play it.  I have given up on any specific Haydn string quartet.  In a different genre, it plays the short version of Manfred Mann's ""Blinded by the Light"" instead of the long version.  On the other hand, it is great for playing Sirius XM radio and radio stations.  It does many things well, but it is not great for classical music and odd bits of popular music."	3	August 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I like the functions it provides. It‚Äôs kind of annoying asking it to do certain things and it refers you to the app instead of just self correcting. Also I would like to be able to change the name other than the ones given. Overall I‚Äôm enjoying it	3	October 10, 2021	1

Echo Dot	Terrible Voice RecognitionSound Quality of a Potato	3	February 18, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"The device itself isn't that bad when it comes to sound quality, but what irritates me beyond belief is the rants it goes on when asked a question. You can ask what time it is and it responds like this, ""It's 5 PM. By the way..."", and it starts spouting off some stupid crap. All I want is the time or an answer to what I ask, I don't need it to suggest some irrelevant garbage.UPDATE : Now there are times I literally have to scream extremely loudly two or three times to get the device to respond. Thought it was maybe my particular unit but I have two others that were rarely used and they do the same thing."	1	August 24, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I've had a few of the echo devices become defective in the speaker quality. Cracking and poor sound quality. This one is about 8 months old and has sound quality issues. I called about getting a replacement because it says a replacement may be possible until a certain date (which has not occurred yet). I was provided terrible customer service and am left with my issue. Not really interested in purchasing another echo for the same issue to occur. Really makes me want to switch to another type of smart speaker.	1	September 21, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Bought it to control a smart lamp. Think the Smart Lamp is defective because never could link with other methods either. Not impressed with asking it questions because typing into phone is better and Siri is just slightly better.Works great as a Blue Tooth Speaker, clear sounds and is small.I keep the mic off unless asking questions because it does not seem a good idea to keep a listening device on. At least they do have a mic off switch. If you say Alexa, the blue light will come on.	3	June 27, 2021	1

Echo Dot	Just comparing Echo‚Äôs voice between 2nd and 3rd generation, I detect no improvement.  Recognizing that i have slight hearing diminution, i have to qualify my observation. Even though Treble and midrange, as well as base, can be adjusted, each -6 to + 6, that doesn‚Äôt translate to enough detectable difference in Echo‚Äôs spoken ( ‚Äúfuzzy‚Äù to me) word. The difference between SIri‚Äôs treble and Echo‚Äôs is night and day. While Echo sound avoids any ‚Äútinny‚Äù quality of iphone, at least i find Siri extremely easy to understand, while i struggle‚Äînot always successfully‚Äîto understand Echo, whether it be just Time of Day, or In telling me anything else.This ‚Äúreview‚Äù is not about all the other miracles of Echo, the wonderful, pliant, human inflections, even lilt, in Echo‚Äôs voice, the vast data base, extraordinary ability to understand questions offered in various ways, etc.	3	September 20, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"I got this hoping it would just act as an ""extension"" to my current Echo device, it doesn't. I wanted something that when I gave it a command it would apply to both of them but it only goes to the one that Alexa thinks i'm closest to. So if i give one a command and then move to another part of the house I won't hear what's being played or what alarm i have set up.I know I can stream music over all of them but I wanted it to play my morning briefing on all devices or have all devices go off when an alarm goes off but that doesn't happen.I would not have purchased this had i known how limited it was."	2	December 14, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I guess someone thought they could get more revenue by playing ads while listening to your Amazon music Playlist that only contains purchased music. What's the point in buying music from Amazon music only to have to listen to ads still. Avoid this product if you want to use it as a speaker to listen to purchased music.	1	October 28, 2022	0

I read the terms and conditions and I've heard about the complaints, but I made the conscious choice to purchase this product and I believe it would be great to have around if I could get it to work.Especially when you lose the remote during a movie, or want to wake up to fresh coffee, or even need the outside light on before you forgot and have your hands full, it has a lot of useful features. It's your choice whether you get it, but it does seem like it would come in handy for a busy home life!"	3	November 11, 2020	1

I then tried my first command again and it still couldn't find eJazz Artistry.Another thing I've noticed is that it doesn't like having it's power cut. Had a power outage and after my generator kicked in and the Echo reconnected, I issued the command, ""Alexa resume"" and got the response, ""There is nothing to resume"". If it can reconnect to my wi-fi without me having to reconfigure the setup, why can't it remember at least my last command?"	3	December 7, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I switched over to Echo from Google when I signed up for Amazon Prime. If I had to do it all over again, I'd still be using the Google set-up. I have 2 Echo 3's.  One has worked well, the other has been replaced once and the replacement is disappointing too. (The return was fast and easier. Amazon is pretty good at that.) The unit shuts off on its own and I have to reboot the speaker. This happens every couple of days. I never had a connection problem with Google (2+years).  Additionally, Alexa only plays music for a limited time, and then stops. If you want more music, you have to request it. Google looped music until you told it to stop. As I said earlier, I wish I had just kept my Google Dots. I gave them away, but I might be able to get them back. For anyone in the market, I'd suggest that you do your due diligence.  Or just pick a Google product.	3	January 20, 2020	1

I have had to unplug her for 20-30 seconds here and there to get her to cooperate. It‚Äôs super annoying when she is suppose to help me turn on/off the lights. Pretty frustrating. It‚Äôs tempting me to rearrange my lamp set up in the house to avoid having to use her. She also doesn‚Äôt follow through on her routines either, which are set up for a reason. Alexa, what was the point of buying you?	3	June 19, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Alexa Multi-Room music was one of the key reasons we bought 2 Dots.  Couldn't get it to work - hit the internet to try and fix solution and still couldn't get it functional.  Many others have reported this problem.  I have 2 Gen3 Dots so that isn't the issue.  I find Alexa's use outside of simple things - set a kitchen timer, ask the current temperature is not all that useful.  Music was the main use case and it was a struggle.FIX!  If a Dot has a bluetooth connection to ANYTHING, this can cause problems with multi-room.  I cleared out all the bluetooth connections for the Dots and multi-room is up and running.  Still kludgey, not sure how much value we are getting but at the least the music feature works!	3	September 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa doesn‚Äôt recognize certain questions, I guess based on what the creator/manufacturer designed. For example, if I ask Alexa to play the news by CNN or Reuters, it is recognized. If I ask to play the news by MSNBC, it‚Äôs not recognized. Within two weeks of having the dot in my home, Alexa ‚Äúforgot‚Äù my Morning Routine that I set up. I had to contact the he  lo p desk via chat to get help. I ended up having to delete all of my routines, & then re-add them. It worked, but that was pretty frustrating. The sound quality is very nice, & when working properly, the dot is a nice addition to your home automation.	3	March 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Definitely  not as smart as the Google speaker.	3	February 5, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I had great expectations about Alexa and this Echo Dot speaker. I found full regret since I opened the box:First of all ""No battery = Ever Connected to energy"". For a Bluetooth speaker a rechargeable battery is a MUST. So Portable is a NO for this unit.Then I found out that Alexa Skill are really hard to find the android app is slow and have many bugs. Also its really complicated to find the correct settings is so crowded of options that it tends to make you feel anxious.Voice recognition is really bad. If Im playing music I have to yell at it really hard in order to the device to accept my command. And this is being within 1 meter from the device. So you play music and you cant get voice recognition to say simple commands like stop, next, previous.Averall the experience was really bad. Thankfully the unit just costs me $5 + tax on promotion."	2	September 20, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"If you have a smart phone, pretty much like just about everyone does.. and you have a bluetooth speaker, like a lot of people do, then you don't need this taking up more space in your home.  I just put mine in the trash  due to this reason..no need for it.. OH, and if you work in the same room as this thing, and you make long calls for work, this will think you are asking for something and start talking to you in the background. Not cool when you are on a business call.  I also didn't like that it was yet another device that is probably monitoring every word I say.so, just use your smart phone and a blue tooth speaker that probably has better sound anyway..I got mine for ""free"" during a Sirius XM promo when the price was $50. Then they were giving them away for $22 at Christmas.. yah, that tells you all you need to know. Save your money"	3	December 15, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"Everything works great when it works. I have this device in my home gym, which is directly above my wireless router. Signal quality is great where it is located. I use the device almost every night to play music while I workout. However, every few days I will walk into the room, ask Alexa to play music for me, and the Dot responds with something along the lines of ""I'm having trouble connecting please check your Alexa app for help"". I do this and attempt to reset the wifi connection, only for it to say my password is incorrect, which it isn't, I triple checked. So I reset the device and it flashes yellow continuously for several minutes and never actually does anything. After messing with it for 30 minutes to an hour, I can finally get it to work by what seemed like luck of the draw. This is the only Echo product I have ever owned to have these issues, and it's incredibly frustrating having a product that doesn't do it's one job because it has connectivity issues. I got this as a convenient, easy speaker for my workout room, and the device has failed too many times for me to keep using it like this. I will be switching to another product to serve my purposes, as the connectivity issues in this product are unforgivable."	2	June 23, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I have a Echo 1st generation and now bought the Echo 3th generation. So far so good the sound its loader and more clean. Can produce better base but not too strong. Do all of the 1st generation but now can control much more stuff with Alexa. You can ask for traffic, time of the day, weather, jokes, use it for multiple alarms and reminders, can use it like a simple calculator, ask about sports results, produce music from Amazon and more.So far the CONS that I found are:1. No usb-c or micro usb connection for power it. Its a unique power cable with a power supply.2. Sometimes need to talk several times or close to activate Alexa. The 1st generation was more sensible listening my voice.	3	November 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"We bought 6 of them, and they are a headache all the time.1. Try to change the volume from the Alexa app but can't because ""you must be playing audio"". So if you want to play something with low volume because someone is asleep nearby and it was on 90% last time it was used, TOO BAD. You must start the audio Loud, wake them up and quickly turn it down. So smart!2a. When one of the Dots can't connect to the internet, all it can do is tell you to check the app, no other information is given. You can't even ask the device name so you know which device to look at in the app.2b. There's actually no point in looking in the Help section, the only thing you can actually do it unplug it because everything else (Computers, other Echo Dots, Phones, TV) is working just fine on the WiFi, and the problem Dot has the same settings as ll the rest in the app, it's the POS Dot that is the problem. This is a weekly occurrence.3. No way to play multiple devices at the same time from the app, you have to try to talk to the device; which if you own one, you know is more than just a pain for customized names/groups.4. Close to impossible to play custom Spotify playlist names. It's great if you want to stand and repeat yourself over and over again while telling Alexa to stop in between each time until you finally give up and let it play whatever the hell it picked.5. No way to use the app to ping/play a sound to identify which device is which.How much money does Amazon have? Clearly not enough to pay a UI group and good programmers."	1	June 14, 2020	0

Echo Dot	It's a cheap design meant to rope you into using Amazon's app to use services like Pandora, and their app isn't nearly as good.What's the point of this useless thing? It teases you with an aux jack making you think you can input, nope, it's output only...on a speaker.Why can't you stream directly from a phone with this thing? Because it's dumb, and you have to use that dumb in house app.Useless waste of $17, I threw it out.	1	September 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	We had an Alexa previously that worked fairly well that my son took to college. I bought the same thing again and have had nothing but problems. She rarely knows what we are asking and at least 3 times a week we have to go through the process of syncing the lights. She never remembers our music and has a serious jones for Eric Church.	3	August 29, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"Alexa's voice sounds like she's talking through a pillow.  Music and other app voices are clear; it's just Alexa voice. Checked reviews and forums and found literally hundreds of the same complaint.  In response to one complaint one corporate lackey writes, ""So the dot is not pathetic it is doing what it was designed to do--to be used with an external device-- Amazon has much nicer speaker but it will cost.""  Seriously?  No where in the Echo Dot description does it say, ""designed to be used with external speaker"".  I got it for free for signing up for my auto-maker's extra services so at least I've invested nothing (and it works great for starting my car on those cold days).  I wouldn't waste money on it though. The competition's inexpensive option is far and away better sound quality all around and connects to just as many devices (except ordering from Amazon).  So, beware, Dot works but get used to repeating yourself or cranking up the volume to understand Alexa and turning it back down so you don't blast yourself with any other sound coming out of it."	2	March 19, 2021	0

Echo Dot	I try to get Echo to perform tasks within its capabilities and it‚Äôs a hit or miss. Sometimes it does it and other times it says it can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs frustrating and takes away from the joy that‚Äôs supposed to come with the ease of having an Alexa device.	3	September 28, 2021	1

Echo Dot	Sorry Amazon but I'm being generous by giving 2 stars. That's because it was only $20. She understands nothing I ask. Never one time has she got one thing even remotely close to answering my question. When I ask to listen to music from my phone using YouTube Music, she says she can't. She can only play Amazon music or Spotify. Neither have even anywhere near the amount of music YouTube has. And it's cheaper too. It's now a paper weight. Oh and one more thing, she can't turn lights on very well either. Had high hopes for it too	2	February 9, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Update 3-I was grandfathered in on when customers could share Prime without sharing the credit card.  After more than 10 years the other person sharing my Prime account (different email and phone) is now getting updates on everything I buy and return. I already had problems with security when it misunderstood what I said and was ransoming calling people in my contact lisUpdate lowered my rating because the device is just spouting off random stuff more often. It is also responding more often to words that are similar to the wake words but are not them. (lexicon, let us, etc).  I have changed the wake world and that helps some, but the pro elm with the device just spouting off is still a problem as well as the ‚Äúhelpful‚Äù tips.  I have removed one device and using Siri on my phone more.The 2nd generation sounded better and the voice recognition was better.  I had to name this device differently than the one in the other room because the older device consistently responded rather than the 3rd generation device I was 2 feet from.The integration with smart devices is usually pretty good, but why do you need to install separate skills for everything?  The communication is hit and miss.  I tell it to call the Amazon devices by default and then the time time I call it asks if I want to call their phone or device.The knowledge is actually quite good.	1	July 25, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Alexa dot was great in the beginning however it did not even last one year. 11 months after buying it my Alexa dot stopped working. The speaker no longer works and Alexa listens and responds however there is no volume. The dot is not mute or low volume either, it just doesn‚Äôt play any sound anymore even after factory resetting it. Before that  I also needed to restart the connection process because it would randomly disconnect and never connect again unless I manually restarted it.	3	July 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I have an echo product in my Living Room. I wanted them to work independently and they don‚Äôt	3	January 4, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The only reason why this product is getting a one-star rating from me is because I am not allowing Amazon or anyone else to put a spy in my house to listen to everything I say and potentially get me arrested for it. Because if you didn't know the Alexa has gotten people sent to prison. Were they committing crimes I don't know. Would they be in prison now if it wasn't for Alexa definitely not.I thought 1984 what happened more aggressively but you're trying to get us to pay to put your spies in our home. This is beyond upsetting, because I really like what the Alexa can do I like smart home technology. And you have ruined it by turning over the things Alexa hears to the police.	1	July 28, 2022	0

Echo Dot	The product has good enough sound, great smart home integration and detects my voice commands much better than any of the google smart speakers or homepod minis I have around the house.Unfortunately that's where the good stops. The alexa app, while better than the google equivalent, still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of finding features.The one feature however that makes me regret my purchase more than anything else though is that you effectively cannot share the device with other household members if you have any intention of using smart home features.Any other users of the echo devices must have full access to your amazon account and be logged in as you. You can set up a household and link ONE more adult's amazon account, but then they have no access to any smart home routines or devices, rendering the whole exercise pointless.I did not see any of these limitations before buying several echos to replace my google devices, however now that I'm aware of it I was able to find complaints about this very thing going back several years. It seems amazon has no intention of adding such a basic feature that every one of their competitors can do. I'd give this 4 or 5 stars if they could fix this limitation or were living alone, but as is, I can't recommend it at all.	1	November 30, 2021	0

Echo Dot	I bought this in May and it stopped responding in late September. I tried all of the online documentation to get it fixed and tried everything I could think of. I‚Äôve got a decent technical background, including working Level 1 and Level 2 help desk for a large internet company.After trying everything I could think of, I contacted customer service via chat. I spent an hour with Melissa, who basically just had me do the same thing over and over again, while getting the same result. Then they bumped it up to Piyush (I assume that was the Level 2 person).I essentially got the same treatment from Piyush who had me do all of the same things over and over again with no improvement.Finally, after nearly 2 hours of this, they said they couldn‚Äôt do anything more for me and because it was out of warranty (it only has a 90 day warranty because they don‚Äôt believe in their product) all they could offer was a 15% discount on the purchase of a new device. What a joke!Needless to say, I had some choice words for Piyush. This didn‚Äôt change anything. Amazon dug in and said that was all they could do.This is terrible customer service and just plain stupid. As someone who has spent thousands through this site, the fact that they couldn‚Äôt fix their recently sold product at a cost of maybe $10 to them is absurd.Instead, I will be switching to Google devices and finding other places to make purchases with and canceling my Amazon credit card.What a stupid company. Losing thousands to save a few dollars.	1	November 16, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I got my echo devices for mostly the ability to have music in every room of my house. This worked out well until I cancelled my SiriusXM account and switched to Amazon music. When I streamed Sirius from my echos sound was good and the volume was consistent over every song. Enter Amazon music and now when I try to stream music the volume for each song is all over the map. Set one song to volume 5 and its sounds good, but the next some comes on like you turned it up to 10, then you turn that down and you might not be able to even hear the next song. This only happens when streaming from the echo devices themselves. If you are streaming music from the app or to your echo from a smart phone this is not a problem, because the app has a loudness normalization option that can be turned on. The echo devices have no such option. So you can stream to your devices just not from them which renders them kinda useless for multi room music.I talked to tech support today, but they do not seem to see this as a critical issue. I‚Äôll put up with the ‚ÄúTry Alexa‚Äù banners, if they can fix this. If not, there are other devices.	2	August 5, 2020	0

Imagine my surprise when I went into the phone app and found that anyone in the house could just ""drop in.""Turn that off Amazon!  That should be a very clear setting on initial config, with a warning that says ""WARNING:  DO NOT TURN THIS ON IF YOU DON'T WANT OTHERS IN THE HOUSE SNOOPING ON YOU.""

Echo Dot	Initially worked for about 4 days. then the ECHO stopped recognizing voice commands. I reset my router and modem and the unit worked for about a day. Then the unit stopped working again. I then reset my modem, Router and did a hard reset on the ECHO device. seemed to fix my issue. Then next day, same issue pops up. I contact AMAZON SUPPORT on the 4th FAILURE. I work with the support to do everything I had done on the previous fix. Reset the Router, Modem and hard reset the ECHO. Seemed to work again. next day... 5th FAILURE. I contact AMAZON SUPPORT yet again. I asked for a replacement unit and they wanted me to again, Reset the Modem, Router and the ECHO. this time they also reset remotely on the AMAZON system. Yet again everything seemed to work again. Now here comes today. FAILURE #6. I contact AMAZON SPPORT and ask for a replacement unit. After 6 FAILURES it is time to cut losses and move on. NO HELP. for the record... We own 9 ECHO's in total and use them to control our lights in the house and printers.

Factory reset and re-add to the Alexa app. Same result. Called Amazon customer support as I wanted to replace under warranty. Customer support wants to reboot. ""Please remove power for 1 min and then plug power back in"" Yeah I did that already but I'll play along with you.... Same result.  Customer Support now wants to reboot (power off and on) my router and house wifi. Have you ever powered down your entire house wifi with family streaming on the TV, someone doing homework on a computer etc??  Ok, I'll do that.  ..... .... ..... same result. Alexa comes on, can answer two or three questions and then stops responding. Customer support wants to do ALL THAT again. I say NO - replace under warranty or I'm done and it goes in the trash..... Guess what happened??? Yep Amazon Echo Dot gen 3 in the trash.To be honest, I'm glad. Alexa isn't worth the bother for the unbelievably shallow amount of functionality I get from it.

Echo Dot	"I bought the original Dot when it was first introduced. It works well and sounds good for its size.I was expecting this newer version 3 to sound and work even better. Sadly, the sound quality is much worse.If you have ever heard a speaker with a blown tweeter and muddy bass, that's what this new Dot v3 sounds like.The bass is thick, muddy and indistinct. There really are no real highs. There's nothing about my setup to make it sound like that. I have to assume that it's either defective or poorly designed.I'd have returned it but for the fact that it came bundled with something else. Returning the Dot would result in breaking the package price on the other item.So, unless Amazon responds by arranging a swap with one that sounds good, I guess I'm stuck with it and will keep it around as just an Alexa device that's not for music.Sad that this product got worse as it was ""improved""."	2	July 16, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Siri, Google, take note: although I love you both in your own way, Alexa is actually FUN! The voice assistant lacks the robotic feel we get used to in other devices.Alexa will occasionally make a joke even when I didn‚Äôt specifically ask for one.Once I integrated her into my home, I found that she goes into guard mode whenever I set my security system to arm. It does not matter what device our operating system was used to arm it. The system automatically sets a lighting routine to mimic someone being home. Note if she would just turn on the television.My biggest gripe, and it is a big one. The skills, the basis of what allows you to integrate Alexa with other functionality appears to be poorly written for the most part. The skills store is filled with one and two star ratings and rightfully so.

Echo Dot	The device is pretty good for the most part. But it has a tendency to flip out occasionally and seems to run pretty hot. We have to reboot it every week or two it seems.Better sound quality than the original. Doesn't always pickup your voice or commands. Especially people like my wife that talk more quietly.We use it to set timers, listen to the news, get the weather, and listen to music primarily. Occasionally ask it questions. Search functionality is pretty limited.It can control my ecobee thermostat, but it is difficult for some features. Also haven't really figured out what else to use it for. Maybe get one of those smart plugs and control a few lights. There seem to be a lot of apps or whatever they are called. But very few are of interest or use to me.I would love to find more functional use for it. U do like the room to room comm system.	3	January 18, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I bought this Echo 3 at Home Depot. They had a massive amount of them, all placed next to the cash registers at a discount for impromptu buyers (me). At home, plugged it in. The blue light that circles around the device did that for 20 twenty minutes without stopping. Finally it stopped, and the system worked. The Echo Dot is next to my router, yet the system is slow. Ask it about anything, it takes 15 seconds on average to respond, but the information is accurate. New out of the box, the system (only to me) looks refurbished. Sound quality is somewhat muffled, but still understandable. I'll buy a 4th generation Echo soon. Then I'll pitch this 3rd generation one in the garbage.	3	January 5, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"I mainly use (or try to use) my 5 dots for smart home control. They have a lot of trouble with voice recognition, making it infuriating at times. For example, I've said ""Alexa, turn on the living room light"" and it seriously replied ""I cant find a device called closet door."" This happens about 50% of the time. I end up having to say ""Alexa off"" or ""Alexa stop"" and asking again a couple of times before anything works. It doesn't seem to learn your voice like the google home/assistant does.The sound quality is pretty bad if you want to listen to music with it. Its all kinds of muddy and unclear.I deeply regret investing in the Amazon Alexa ecosystem. I honestly prefer to manually utilize my smart home devices with their accompanying apps on my Android phone over my echo junk. Sure, its less convenient, but its quicker and less frustrating since I don't have to argue with Alexa's dumb-a-s-s.

Echo Dot	An amazing speaker with tons of bass when it works. Unfortunately after the first 6 months it started having issues, now whenever I try to use this device it has a red circle. The red circle appears when I ask alexa to do things. Red circle Alexa tells me to check the help center for help with the device. According to the help center the abrupt issue is that the dot disconnects itself from the internet and this issue seems to be temperamental as it starts for no reason and has once fixed itself for a few days.  It's important to note I have plenty of other smart devices in my home but this dot is the only one with this issue. They are also all connected to same wifi (and this one is the closest to the router). I reached out to amazon with hopes they could troubleshoot and their solution was to contact my internet provider even though none of other devices have an issue with wifi.  I did do that and still no solution after time wasted with troubling my internet provider.  I will admit that I assume the main issue is that my dot mine defective so buyer beware based on worse case scenario.  I just Amazon was more helpful with this device.	2	July 7, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The jury is still out.It has its fundamental uses, , e.g., ‚ÄúAlexa, what is the current temperature?‚ÄùBefore purchasing, the product description I read said I could change Alexa‚Äôs name. I wrongfully assumed I would be able to change the name to anything I liked. Wrong. There are only 3 choices: Alexa, Echo, and Computer. I was disappointed that I could not name it Moon Unit, or whatever else I wanted. So, I chose Computer. Later, I was having a conversation about computers with a friend and, presto! The unit woke up and started telling me what a computer is.I changed the product name back to Alexa, but when talking with friends who are interested, I have to refer to the product as ‚Äúthe A word‚Äù, or it will wake up.It does tasks which are easily done by my phone, so Alexa and I are in a love/ hate relationship at this time.Not sure I would order again.	3	February 13, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I had to buy the Echo to set up my SimpliSafe security system. My non techie husband hates it. But I have to admit it was really funny when his new FLIP PHONE (I DID a say non techie) talked to Alexa and she responded that she didn‚Äôt understand.  After I set up the system, I moved her to the laundry room. I‚Äôm not comfortable with something listening all the time - that‚Äôs just creepy.	3	July 24, 2021	1
Echo Dot	3rd Gen seems to have a mind of its own. Even tho I lower the volume, the next time I ask Alexa for some something, the volume is loud. And, I miss the surface with recessed controls. My Dot is black, and actually unattractive. Looks like a hockey puck.	3	September 14, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Speaker placement is important for sound quality and microphone pick up.	3	January 28, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"We received the Echo Dot 3rd Gen as a gift. We have had fun with it, but it can be frustrating. We are learning new ways to use it, but it's a bit complicated. If you don't use the ""proper"" language, it doesn't always understand what you want. I set up a reminder/alarm to go off every morning at 8 am. It is supposed to tune in to a certain radio channel. It worked ok for a few days, but would turn off after a couple minutes. Then it started just making a noise at the proper time, but doesn't tune in to the radio anymore. I always have to turn up the volume, we have a problem hearing it, even though I am 3 feet away from it. If I had not received it as a gift, I don't think I would have purchased it myself."	3	June 15, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"When I first got my Alexa, I was really happy and started making a playlist of songs.  But then things started getting frustrating when she couldn't (or wouldn't) play song I asked for that Amazon sells and are available for streaming, even though I'm subscribed to Amazon's Music Unlimited.I got a USB dongle and paired my PC with my Alexa, so I could add songs from my PC to my Alexa playlist.  No go.  She only works as a speaker when paired with another device.  So I have to walk to the other side of my trailer and hit play on the PC, then walk back to the other room to hear it.And music Amazon doesn't sell, like Jiva, which released five albums on George Harrison's Dark Horse label, which I legally bought and downloaded to my PC from their website, cannot be added to my Alexa playlist.  When Alexa is playing a song from my PC via Bluetooth and I say ""Alexa, add this to my playlist"" she responds with ""I'm not playing anything at the moment.""So, while I really liked her when I first got her, my opinion has gone big-time downhill."	1	February 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The only positive reviews you will see from this are people who havent ever used Google Home assistants and have only ever used the Alexa. If this is your first time buying a home assistant, then yes you will enjoy this. But she doesnt have good comprehension, is annoying and trys to sell you things and it wont let you synch up with anything google. So if you also use Youtube Music for example, Alexa wont play that she will try to sell you on Amazon Music (who TF uses that?)  Truly, I am exactly the person these were made for. A homebody with ADD who is too lazy to look up everything I think about, and man Alexa is awful. I had Google first, then tried Alexa and now have Google in every room.	1	July 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It turns out that you need a premium streaming music service to really make this worthwhile.  You can do some things without that, though.  You can listen to your cell phone or iPod's music by sending the audio output to the Echo Dot via bluetooth.  You can also listen to the free version of one of the music streaming services, but then you can't request a particular song.  Instead, Alexa will find a streaming radio station based on your request.  Alexa will also help you make lists, like shopping lists, and let you add items to your list.  I thought the sound quality was okay, although I don't think it's as good as the larger versions of Echo.	3	December 13, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I find this is a toy at best. If you want to know the weather/time or something to read the news, buy one. Most other tasks, Alexa is pretty worthless. I bought one to be able to control my home theater system and replace my Harmony remote, but even with a new 7 series Samsung, Alexa is worthless (can turn on/off36% of the time and that's it). I bought an IR blaster, which works well with the tv, but not so well with Alexa. My Yamaha Receiver does ok, but still doesn't do that well. Lights typically work well, but it's on/off; literally the most basic task you can ask it. Bottom line: 9/10 I just grab the remote an do what Alexa couldn't. Most questions you ask her, she gets wrong. What's the point? I really love voice activated automation, but I feel this isn't all much better than the Microsoft Agents voice automation I used to play with 20 years ago.	3	January 20, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I used to love my little dots. I have one in my bedroom that I‚Äôve used as an alarm, played rain sounds all night and even had it ‚Äúbug‚Äù me to get out of bed. But now it seems like every other day I say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Ä¶‚Äù and it just gives me the red ring of anger‚Ä¶disconnected. I unplug it and plug it back in, which usually fixes it, but not anymore. Now it seems like that doesn‚Äôt work and I have to reset the whole device to get it to connect to my Internet. I have good Xfinity internet, so that‚Äôs not the problem. Now I‚Äôve just given up as it‚Äôs become more of a problem than something I enjoy. I even have a brand new one sitting unopened because I‚Äôd be embarrassed if I gave it to a friend and they had this problem after I‚Äôve talked it up. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend them and I can‚Äôt see myself buying any more in the future.	2	September 4, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Having a hard time getting this connected with Amazon music but other then that it works great.	3	December 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I ordered this because Amazon was offering it for a great price,  not that I was unhappy with my 2nd generation Dot.  Keep in mind, I only use the Dot for playing sleep sounds.  My favorite is ""Thunderstorms"". It really helps me fall asleep.  So I was excited to get the 3rd generation Dot as it has a larger speaker.  Unfortunately,  when I play my sleep Thunderstorms,  the tweeter in this Dot overpowers the rest of the speaker and the rain sounds very high-pitched and ""tinny"". Again, I only use this for sleep sounds so, for someone listening to music, it may very well be better than the 2nd generation.  Fortunately, I have the Show to watch videos and listen to music."	3	October 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	i can‚Äôt get it to connect to my fire tv. Which kind of defeats the purpose because I don‚Äôt really need it for anything else. I figured at the very least I could use it when the remote is out of reach, Alexa can turn the tv off/on or adjust the volume for me but I can‚Äôt even do that so basically it‚Äôs just a speaker. All it gets used for is music so it would be nice if I could unplug it and at least take it to the pool right outside because it‚Äôs otherwise useless. I expected more from Amazon. Don‚Äôt buy the echo dot, just wait until it‚Äôs given away as a ‚Äúfree gift with purchase‚Äù somewhere. Glad mine was free. I guess you could use it as a light switch, but in my opinion that‚Äôs just plain lazy.	3	July 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have Google Minis through out my home. I ordered this on a discounted promotion just to have a little balance in my AI. Alexa's knowledge base just can't compete with Google. It is fine and convienent for interfacing with Amazon, but for doing other tasks, it just doesn't come close to what I can do with Google. I do like the notification tones and lights which again, is compatiable with Amazon.  And it is handy, when Amazon runs Alexa only promotions- but I don't use it several times a day like I do my Google Mini.	3	May 31, 2021	1

Echo Dot	while the new dots have nice sound, they changed the music app so now you can not upload your own music to cloud, thus if it is not in music library you can not play it. when the echo first came out you were able to up load a certain amount of music to amazon cloud, so like my daughter singing. now you can not. very disappointed. they keep talking about using music from computer but that can not be used in play list and if i wanted a blue tooth speaker that what i would of bought.	2	January 27, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Amazon has to step up with the echo dot. It seriously needs a lot of improvements, in order to call it a ‚Äúgood smart speaker.‚ÄùAmazon needs to fix the tinny sound that these tiny speakers produce. It‚Äôs terrible, especially for $50. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I saw a speaker like the one in an echo dot at a dollar store. I mean, seriously Amazon. Customers want to be able to listen to their music WITHOUT the speaker sounding like fingernails on a chalk board at 65%+ volume. We want CLEAR high quality audio NO MATTER if it‚Äôs an echo, echo dot, echo show, etc. We also don‚Äôt want to wait FOREVER for the echo to turn on. It literally takes mine 7+ minutes just for the thing to turn on.  And, integration is harder, and more frustrating to do on the echo lineup, than the google home lineup.  I‚Äôve used the both the echo‚Äôs and the Google homes, and Google has really listened to their customers. No tinny sounds on the Home Mini, or Home hub. Yet, here we are with Amazon. Wish I could return mine, but I got it at a deal, so I‚Äôll just keep it in a closet, and happily use my Google Home devices, until amazon fixes the issues I listed in this review.	2	May 12, 2020	0

Echo Dot	She‚Äôs ok. She doesn‚Äôt understand a lot of Korean music. She can‚Äôt pick up on names. So she won‚Äôt even play the music I ask her too play. She likes 2 turn off a lot while you‚Äôre talking. She doesn‚Äôt understand a lot of stuff. She literally turns on & then immediately shutdown on you. A lot of times you have too keep turning her back on and off. We have at this point a love/hate relationship lol. It‚Äôs complicated the way she acts. Good luck 2 anyone who buys her. Hopefully you don‚Äôt like overseas music because she won‚Äôt usually ever play that at all. Good luck	3	March 14, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This device epitomizes how far we‚Äôve come with technology and how technology is advancing. Overall, Echo dot is very helpful and useful. On the other hand, it comes with many problems. It works most times but some times it just doesn‚Äôt. Today I am having a problem with Alexa. I say the name and it says ‚ÄúSorry I am having trouble understanding right now please try a little later‚Äù. So I did some research to try and resolve the problem but there‚Äôs no accurate information on this. You‚Äôd think that Amazon would be willing to help, but Amazon barely has input on the many problems echo dot users face. It‚Äôs disappointing because it‚Äôs such a great device, but they need to do some advancing.	3	November 25, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"Purchased this during Prime Day (so I can't complain too much), but I am somewhat disappointed.Some key points:- Better sound quality when playing music, but normal Alexa voice seems very muffled compared to gen 2- Voice recognition needs work. Sometimes, Alexa won't respond at all and it takes several attempts at saying ""Alexa"" for it to respond. Sometimes, when I'm cooking and ask Alexa (in the kitchen) to set a timer, the Alexa in my bedroom (on the 2nd floor and on the other side of the house) will set the timer instead of the one I'm literally RIGHT next to - this is very frustrating- Comparing solely on appearance, gen 3 does look significantly better than gen 2"	3	October 30, 2020	1

Echo Dot	This echo dot is actually really cool, it can help you shop, connect with friends, all these other features that they've shown in their ads. The problem I have with it, is that I bought it for the main reason to play music. You can't play specific songs without having prime music. You can however play music on Spotify (can't play specific songs) and Iheart radio (which is pretty good, but doesn't have all the songs I'd like.

Echo Dot	The echo system has a bit to be desired. And the app is pretty much garbage.This dot is about 10 years newer than my other dots and it installed very easy. Speakers sound great.Amazon needs to address major issues with their app though.It's Extremely difficult to get multiple groups to work. Still haven't figured it out. I think may be it's not an option. You can only set up one group per speaker which makes No sense... Also the app is Very cumbersome and convoluted and hard to find things you need. But at least the home screen is adds for Alexa skills... (Sarcastic)Overall if you can deal with the app issues the alexa system is fun and convenient.	3	November 12, 2020	1

Often she will playback things that are days irrelevant to what I asked.I may have to do more ""training"" with my Alexa.  For it's price and value, it's a fun little gadget.  I could take or leave it."	3	February 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The Alexa app is SO SLOW!!! Like dial-up back in 1992.The skills are not developed enough to interact with any natural ease, the response isn't consistent despite the exact same wording, 75% of the times I request a skill, it searches the Firestick instead of responding as the skill is supposed to, the next 20% of the time it responds so far off track that I end up angry and swearing at it because I can't believe you released such a poorly developed and low quality off both products and features.The Google Assistant is SO MUCH MORE ADVANCED AND EASIER TO USE and that's where I am disappointed with Alexa and my two Dots. I hate it so much I don't really even want to keep using the Firestick 4K and Prime streaming cuz Google Assistant and Google TV got you beat for realI'd like to get a full refund so I can get two Google Nest Minis, a Nest Hub Max and the Chromecast with Google TV AND SIX MONTHS OF NETFLIX FREE their platform is so much cleaner and easier to navigate according to how I use it.	2	December 9, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Both my mother and my sister have an Amazon Alexa. I'm not sure if mine is broken but for some reason it has trouble recognizing my voice when I call her name. It does not always understand what I'm saying to it, it might think I'm telling it something completely different. Her voice comes out slightly muffled which makes it hard to understand. But the worst part is that occasionally she just seems to freeze when I asked her command and I'll try to ask it again but it will not go through and then she just seems to shut off all the way. I then have to unplug it and plug it back in for it to work. I'm very disappointed I have a feeling mine might be defective because my sister and mother do not have this experience. I don't really have the time to return it and go through that process so I am just very disappointed right now.	3	December 26, 2019	1

Echo Dot	Bottom line, Alexa listens in to your conversations far too much.  Too many words or combination of words wakes her up to listen.  If you don't mind alexa waking up and listening in to whatever you happen to be talking about, recording it, and then handing it over to amazon and whoever else amazon decides should hear it, go for it.  If you do mind, unplug it, or don't buy it, and wait until they get enough complaints to allow consumers to give it names it can't confuse with everyday conversations.  I bought one, of course, that's how I know how it works, and would recommend it only as a timer at this point.  If you plan on spending the day cooking in the kitchen and need multiple timers, plug it in for that day and then unplug it as soon as you are done cooking.  Seriously.	2	September 21, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Good voice recognition, very bad integration with smart bulbs, supposedly should connect with Bluetooth with them, but failed to connect very often. Sound quality is good enough for me, as I don‚Äôt want to be the source of my music.

The echo dot answers the voice on the TV!  Also, I have to share the worst echo dot moment I've had so far...  Playing some awful music that my kid selected, and I shouted, ""Alexa, way too loud!""

Echo Dot	"I lost my little speaker on an airplane. I didn't know the brand, but the person gifting it to me referred to it as an echo dot, it was a XLeader. I didn't look the same, but I attributed it to a newer model.I ordered this echo dot to replace it. What a mistake. The first thing I noticed was an attached cord. A ""wireless speaker"" apparently just means bluetooth; it is not rechargable and only works if plugged in. Not truly wireless. Okay. Being the popular ""echo dot"" I expected a good quality sound. Not even close to my Xleader. I currently do not use Alexa, but when I do start, this may be a very useful, so I did not return it.  I hunted through the other small speakers, and found one identical to my old one. It is an XLeader Sound Angel, 3rd Generation A8. Both bass (5W) and treble are strong and clear; easy touch controlsand this one came with a waterproof case, all for approx $20. Comes in a variety of colors, and is a quality speaker for a very low price. The EchoDot sound is ok, but nothing like my XLeader. AND EchoDot has a cord.."	1	January 29, 2022	0

It says it can and is setup for it, but nothing.  I wish I had gone the Google route.  And yes the volume is turned up.  It plays sound fine from the Echo device through my sound system but can't connect anything to it wirelessly.  Terrible.  I went though hours of troubles shooting on Amazon's website but nothing helps.  I can only conclude that these items are not compatible.  Now I have couple more pieces of junk technology I wish I had never bought that waste time and never give back.Update: We got it working after 3 days.  Someone responded to a question we had and it helped.  Very convoluted and unfriendly setup.  So add back 2 stars.	3	December 7, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Alexa can be difficult to use. Some songs it won‚Äôt play. Difficult to choose that one song it‚Äôs not listed  I have a hard time trying to use it I end up giving up and get a little frustrated with it. I can‚Äôt connect it to my tv too difficult. I keep trying but I think this thing isn‚Äôt for me.	2	March 27, 2022	0
Echo Dot	If a device could be more frustrating it has yet to be created.Every word spoken is misunderstood. Literally. It fails to understand even the most basic commands, like 'stop' 'go back' etc... It doesn't come with a list of commands it understands, no no. You have to fight with it every time to get it to even repeat a basic function. Phrases that worked yesterday fail today.I got so mad at it I threw it against the floor and then into the trash can. Never again will a device cause so much frustration. Boundaries have been set.All I wanted it to do was play a YouTube song. A song it has played before. A song that is on YouTube (I checked). I have a YouTube premium account. It's a Google device and YouTube is owned by Google. This should be a non issue.Negative star review	1	May 19, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I purchased this hoping to use it every day. I used it the first day and it worked without any issues. I moved it to the kitchen (away from microwave) and once I plugged it back in, it de registered the device on its own. I tried connecting it multiple times to the wifi that‚Äôs already saved (nothing has changed with my wifi), resetting it to its factory settings, and nothing! I‚Äôve done everything step by step and nothing seems to work. It says to manually set up since Alexa  can‚Äôt seem to connect to my wifi and after manually entering it in, it still doesn‚Äôt connect. I uninstalled the Alexa app, restarted my wifi, my phone, made sure my Alexa app is in the latest update, everything is good, it just won‚Äôt connect at all! I‚Äôve been trying to connect it and trying to register it again for the past 3 days and it won‚Äôt switch from offline to online. It won‚Äôt connect at all! The farthest it gets to on the Alexa app for setup is *Searching for device* (I make sure my phone is inches away from it to try to connect) and it stays on that screen for hours. Nothing connects! It‚Äôs extremely frustrating. It‚Äôs a waste of time and money.	1	January 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"after asking for a song or singer, she says ""Here is ___""on ___""  Fill in any thing available in music or talk. Then she goes silent. Multiple attempts to get service help on line failed to rectify the problem. Defective Dot!"	1	November 1, 2022	0
Echo Dot	nott= always easy to understand Alexa	3	January 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I like the echo dot in general, and it's very useful for a lot of small things and questions, but my experience is really soured by how often the Echo says things entirely unprompted. For example, if you ask it something like ""what day does October 26 land on"", it'll tell you it's a Monday and then continue by saying ""by the way, did you know that I can help you find October decoration tips?"" or something like that. I will never, ever, in my life care about something like that. Or, if you set it up to give you delivery notifications, it'll also remind you to write reviews of products you purchased, which is entirely not important compared to delivery reminders. Even if you turn on brief mode and turn off follow up mode, it still gives you these prompts. It's INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.Also, another small thing, but it only has 10 volume settings available by voice, which is frustrating because sometimes at night 1 is too soft and 2 is too loud. Kind of absurd that in 2020 they can't have more than 10 volume settings when literally every other appliance I own has 50-100."	2	October 20, 2020	0

Echo Dot	Comunicaci√≥n con Alexa mala en muchas ocasiones hay que hablarle alto (gritarle) porque no te escucha y no porque hay ruido y algo gracioso estoy hablando con mi hija en FaceTime estoy bien lejos de Alexa y mi hija le dijo a su Alexa tocara una m√∫sica y para sorpresa de los dos mi Alexa empez√≥ a tocar la canci√≥n y la de ella no le respondi√≥ en otras palabras te escucha cuando le da la gana no importa si le hablas bajo o alto y los dos tenemos buena internet con buena velocidad.La calidad del sonido creo que es bastante buena entiendo que no se puede pedir una s√∫per calidad, si pudieron haber echo que si se conecta a un equipo de audio est√© tenga una salida est√©reo.Sobre la m√∫sica de Amazon hay mucha m√∫sica sin calidad, los niveles de grabes , agudos, volumen m√∫sica que tienes que estar bajando o subiendo constantemente	3	January 1, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Got this for listening to music and also programming a wake up routine and timing for my kids in the morning getting ready for school. (Saves me time and hassle for Alexa to tell them they have 5 minutes to get out the door vs me, etc.)  The problem that has slowly developed over the last months is that it no longer wants to connect to the internet, which then means nothing I bought this device for works.  It keeps telling me to reset my router (which I did once just because), but every other connected device in the house has no issue with the router. (A relatively new common, brand name router.)  So guess what Amazon, that means the problem is your device.Looks good.Sounds good. (Not audiophile level good, but not horrible.)Great functionality for people like me who need reminders.Poor internal hardware and/or software.	2	September 3, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Unfortunately for me the device was not workable. I use my phone as a hotspot for internet and that system, for me anyway, just did not work. A technician instructed me to use two mobile devices to hook up to dot. When I did the dot worked for a bit but kept cutting out. I have been told that a hotspot signal is weak and that, plus the fact, we have a lousy internet signal here made it a bust. So I sent the dot back. I‚Äôm sorry I wish that had not been the case.	3	April 21, 2021	1

Echo Dot	Most of the simple things you ask it, it doesn't know the answer to! I was under the impression that it could answer simple questions like you would Google for example.

Echo Dot	I currently have Echos all over my house and I love them. They truly have made my life better. However, I purchased one for my mom and it has not worked well. There have been issues with voice recognition and it will randomly play a loud static noise or stop playing music within a minute after starting. I worked with customer service to get a new power cord and was told I would be reimbursed for the purchase, but I never was. The new power cord unfortunately did not fix the issue either. Unfortunately the majority of this communication happened at the beginning of COVID. Once the numbers began to grow and more employees were working from home, I was no longer able to get ahold of their customer service to fix the issues. My mom ended up buying another one on her own, but I was disappointed that this present never worked for her and I was never reimbursed for the power cord as promised. I still would recommend people to purchase Echos, but be careful of customer service issues during COVID.	2	February 11, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I previously owned an Echo DOT (3rd Gen # DSN: G090U50984660DTV) while in use the unit simply turned off its microphone and can (still yet) only be used from the mobile app (on my phone - No voice commands can be given), the light ring turned red but the microphone button was not lit up and all options to turn it (the microphone) back on. After several weeks I finally ordered a second unit and is operating as well as the previous one did.  I ordered this second one, which goes to show, I think this is something good, but very poor service after the fact.	3	February 10, 2021	1

Echo Dot	It's sound has got too much bass, and lacks fidelity. Does not understand me in one time. Have always to speak in a loud voice! In the morning, when everyone is sleeping! I also have a google home mini, and that can do a lot of jobs compared to this one. Why is Youtube music not supported? I can't find more songs from Amazon, can't ask it to remind me on all my devices. I see it has got a separate port for a headphone jack, that's good. But that's the only good thing.The only thing Alexa is good for me at this time, is to set alarms and that's all.

Echo Dot	I've owned many an Echo device, all with no problems. I updated to a newer Dot on June 2021, but it doesn't work consistently. Sometimes it doesn't respond to my voice. Sometimes the blue light comes on but doesn't stop circling so I can't talk to Echo. Sometimes it doesn't understand what I'm asking for. None of this happened with my previous (and current) devices. I can resolve the problem by disconnecting it from the power source and reconnected it after waiting a minute. I have to do this at least once a week. Customer service took it through all its test, which I've already done many times, and said it's working fine now. Call us when it isn't working.

Echo Dot	Overall it's a neat gadget. There is a lot more I wish I could do with controlling who uses it and when. Instead of everyone being able to use it and just recognize you. Have it only listen to approved people, at least for some things like buying or adding to shopping lists.Another instance is I can't create kids profiles, which would make me feel more comfortable about having these in their rooms. I was hoping to get these for white noise while the kids sleep, alarm clocks, and noise intercom.	3	May 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The last echo dot I had allowed me to play music without a 14.95 a month fee.  They did not have every song a requested but most of them.  This one will not do that.  I feel like $14.95 is about 3 times what they should be charging.  Rip off	2	April 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I bought this (along with my actual echo) just to be able to name a song and have it be played. I pay for Apple Music, but not for Amazon music. I have it set up on the app so that Apple is the default, but a lot of the time when I tell it to play a song, it will respond by telling me I need to pay for Amazon music in order to play a specific song, and then it will start playing other random music that is ""similar"" to what I asked for. A lot of times I will have to say ""Play specific song by specific artist FROM Apple Music"" in order to get it to play, which is just kind of annoying. A lot of times it also cannot find the song, or just doesn't hear me right. Otherwise it works just fine."	3	January 30, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"Bought less than six months ago, upgrading from an older model that lasted for years. This one stopped working. I spent an hour on chat with Customer Service doing things to get it working again. When they decided that I had tried everything, they offered me 15% off a new one, which is pretty insulting. Having bought at least 9 echo devices, the least they could do is send me a new working device, but I was a month past the 90-day warranty. I wouldn't bet on the new versions being better, or even the same, quality as previous versions. Another echo dot I purchased now has speaker issues if I play something for longer than 5 minutes. I declined their ridiculous ""discount"" and will be transitioning to another smart home option. To be honest, I'll be trying much harder to avoid purchasing from Amazon at all."	1	May 9, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I am a fan of the echo, especially the dot. What I am not a fan of is the 3rd generation charcoal version that, unlike its white-colored sister, doesn't display the time. I am sure that a charcoal version with a time display would fly off the shelves as it is the next indicated, most logical upgrade. I also am not a fan of power adapters that don't take advantage of the USB microtechnology, even the C-type would be better than the standard they have chosen.	2	January 14, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I bought the Echo Dot since it was so cheap and I wanted to try out devices like this for the new home I'm building. I really like the ease of setup and for weather, alarms, and lists its great. Then I started playing with the music feature and that's when I discovered that Amazon doesn't allow you to upload your own collection of music to their cloud, so I can't play any of my songs, books, lectures on the Echo Dot unless I bought them on Amazon. Well, that pretty much eliminates Echo as an option for my new home. I'll be going with a different manufacturer. Too bad, because I like the Echo. I just can't understand why Amazon went and changed their approach on this and left their customers high and dry. I had a similar bad experience with Kindle licensing and stopped using that device as well.	3	December 23, 2019	1
Echo Dot	This is my 2nd one. I got an echo almost 2 years ago. Dot is very similar to the echo. Maybe not as good a listener. I have to repeat the wake word sometimes. I use it with Bluetooth connected to a speaker. It loses it's pairing sometimes. The little note that it makes to punctuate when it hears you is so much louder than the other audio I think it will blow out the speaker eventually. These are minor things, just thought I'd mention them.Mostly it is really awesome. I use it for listening to audio books while I cook and clean in the kitchen. I'm spending more time doing those thing, so it's making life better. I was behind on listening to my audio books, I'm catching up now.Just like the other one I use it all the time for timers and alarms. I am absent minded that is my favorite feature.	3	November 5, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"Overall the device performs well and has great voice recognition. However, outside of Amazon Music access and checking the weather, I have found the Alexa service to be nearly useless.Only 20% of the questions I ask elicit a response with Alexa quoting online references (as expected). The other 80% result in a ""Hmm, I'm not sure"" or some other generic response. Asking the hours of operation or phone number for local businesses is a nightmare, making phone calls usually results in Alexa calling the wrong contacts, and the list could go on forever. These issues are all despite the fact that I am very articulate, well spoken and have eliminated physical distance as the cause of the issue. It all boils down to Alexa's inadequate technology. My brother has a Google Assistant and can ask it virtually anything and it will be roughly 95% accurate, making me regret my purchase.My second greatest issue is Alexa's inability to differentiate between voices. Due to this, the Echo Dot began spending more time muted or unplugged from power once my five year old figured out that ""Alexa"" is a magic word. There are no technical or design limitations to implementing this feature, it is simply Amazon's unwillingness to do so. Their unwillingness has virtually rendered this Echo Dot useless. Others across the internet have this same issue and have expressed this same opinion.Not really a complaint but a suggestion for a great feature, would be the Echo Dot being able to remotely alert the owner of noises other than just glass break and smoke alarm detection. Having the option to select to be alerted when hearing any voice and any noise at all would render my home alarm system nearly obsolete."	1	March 4, 2020	0

Echo Dot	You get what you pay for. I have never had an issue with the small video tablets or the big Alexa pods. This one I have in the kitchen counter. Hard to hear what Alexa is saying and she struggles to hear me.	3	August 18, 2021	1

Echo Dot	We have had Alexa‚Äôs for many years. This one is defective. Initially I noticed the sound quality was a step back but was willing to overlook it. Then I realized it has a mind of its own as to when to stop playing music, for example after 4 songs, give or take. If you ask it to continue playing the same station, it starts over with the exact same song sequence. Probably more annoying than that, it actually PAUSES music randomly, and unpauses after like 10 seconds. Very frequently. What the heck	1	August 21, 2022	0
Echo Dot	This product is great when it works, great for playing music and fulfilling demands. Also very easy to set up and the features and new skills you can add to your Echo through the Alexa app can be pretty fun.My only issue with the Echo that I‚Äôm currently using is that it can be unresponsive to my voice commands. The Echo would light up signaling it hears me but it does not follow up for what I asked for. Sometimes it would take multiple tries and even if I stand near it in the quietest of settings this can happen. I‚Äôve tried all the tips and tricks I‚Äôve read online but that doesn‚Äôt help, so it maybe something wrong with the one I‚Äôm using.However, it is great for what it is and it‚Äôs convenient to have around to integrate with your smart devices.	3	January 2, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"I use the echo dot pretty much to listen to music,I like oldies,and classic rock music, there are several station that play my music,only thing is that every time I request to play a station like 60's 70's or British invasion music it will always start with the same song, EJ 70's will start with ""Hotel California"" and British invasion music with ""Here comes the sun"",I can deal with that,but where I got very disappointed was the fact that I can not get good oldies in Spanish,the best music in Spanish is from the 60's,70's and 80's,but I can not get it,instead you can find a bunch of trash music like bachata,regueton,urbano,and all the new mexican music. My solution has been to play Spotify(which has a nice station with this very nice music) through my echo dot."	3	March 24, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I resisted buying anything related to Alexa, for years, as I knew that it would complicate things way more than it was worth, and the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa did not disappoint, the only thing that it controls in the volume on well the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker it can not control the TV, the Firestrick, Ruku, or even the Smart T.V. that are in the house, I am so glad that I did not waste the money on other so called smart items, when you need to connect and do everything either online or on a phone to connect what is the use, the remote already does everything, what possible purpose does this Echo Dot (3rd Gen) do, I will not waste my time or money on something that does nothing	3	February 26, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I've had two simple uses for Alexa, work as an alarm clock and answer simple questions.Why do I need internet for an alarm to work? This has failed me a few times till I gave up.Good luck wasting your time trying to ask questions. Rarely does Alexa understand what I say or give even reasonable answers.Save money and just use your phone.	1	September 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Idk Alexa is a little slow. I can tell/ ask her something and she‚Äôll just ignore me or continue doing whatever she‚Äôs doing. She also talks to herself idk if that means I have ghost trying to talk to her but she‚Äôs still cool or whatever. She reminds me to do things around the house but getting her to turn off the reminder is another thing. I normally have to turn her off just to get her to stop telling me to feed the dogs, water the plants etc.	3	April 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I'm quite happy with the speaker quality. The ability to set timers is really convenient, but beyond that Alexa leaves much to be desired.  Requests for information rarely pull up what I'm looking for, and often aren't even anywhere close. If asking to play a song it get's it wrong as often as it gets it right. If there is one place I would expect it do well, it's interfacing with Amazon directly, but event that's not the case. It can't do seemingly basic tasks like check for credits on my account. On top of that, the web interface where you can tell Alexa whether it did the correct action or not has a strange tendency to occasionally omit requests/actions where Alexa did the wrong thing. Sure that's a behavior you might expect from something ""intelligent,"" but it's not exactly desirable or useful."	3	January 20, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"There are tons of reviews about this product. Tons. I will only add what is important and may not be in other reviews and that is this:Lets say you have your device in a common area of your house. Anyone can enable skills on your device by just telling alexa to enable that skill. ""So what?"" you say. Well here is a fairly common example of how that will be problematic.Lets say you have a child who decides to enable skills that are not appropriate for your child. While there are some parental controls the ability for the PARENT to determine what is or is not appropriate for their child is critical. Personally I don't want my children to be preached to or missionized to  - but there are plently of skills that would open that door up. While I can disable any skill from the app - it can simply be re-enabled by the child just by asking alexa to enable it.  Not only that but Alexa will frequently respond to a request with ""I have a skill that can be enabled for that - do you want to enable it?"" All the child has to do is say yes. This is ridiculous. Alexa needs to allow the owner to determine if they want skills to be enable-able via voice."	2	December 5, 2019	0
Echo Dot	It seems that the Echo's do not integrate well.  The way I am using my four Echo's is as a single speaker system, with only one Echo serving as the host to receive commands.  In this setup, there are times that the songs being played are different between the 'host Echo' and the other three--with the host playing one song and the other three together playing a different song.  Another problem is that the 'system' seems to act as if it has been playing a station even when it is commanded to be off---not that anyone hears it but it seems to continue to stream---and then when the host receives a command to play a particular station it just continues playing the station that was previously playing---picking up in the middle of a song.  You've still got 'bugs' that need to be worked out.	3	December 12, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I already had a 2nd gen Echo Dot and have absolutely loved it! When I finally decided to get a second one for my bedroom, the 3rd generation was out. From the moment I plugged it in, the sound coming from the 3rd generation Dot has been muffled, like I have it sitting under my pillow instead of on a bedside table. I primarily use the Echo Dot for listening to audiobooks, getting information, setting reminders, etc., and controlling my smart plug devices, but because of the poor sound quality on this version of the Dot I can barely understand what is being said unless I turn the volume up so high it disturbs my neighbors. I feel like I wasted my money on this one, I should have stuck with the app on my phone for my bedroom.	3	February 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I love the 3rd Gen Echo Dot.Everything is great about it. The look, features, etc. Everything is great.But its a speaker. And I‚Äôm an audiophile. This speaker is an improvement over the 2nd Gen, but still its awful. It distorts at full volume and is way too full. The sound is muddy and has way too much bass.You do have the ability to turn the bass and mid-range ‚Äúall the way down‚Äù; and I choose to turn the treble ‚Äúall the way up,‚Äù and it is still muddy. It‚Äôs very disappointing, but still an improvement.They went from one extreme to the other. Last Gen was to bright and thin; this is to thick and muddy.	3	July 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Having issues with sound quality. If I ask Alexa a question she‚Äôll answer. I pay extra monthly forAmazon music and if I ask her to play a song then she‚Äôll say ‚Äúplaying this song, by this artist, on Amazon music.‚Äù But there is NO SOUND. Other then that it‚Äôs a great product. The idea is there but need more info on the web on how to trouble shoot. It makes you download an app for it and ever since then it just hasn‚Äôt worked the same.	3	May 4, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"Update 8/10/21: Alexa devices perform worse and worse the longer you use them. Not because of device failure, but because the Amazon ""smart"" assistant, Alexa, is the most garbage, idiotic software ever developed. You think it's all set up and working one day, and then the next day nothing is working. If you want to spend half your life on the phone with an inneffective support team from India, then by all means purchase this product. If you want to retain a semblance of sanity, run far away from ANY smart device that has ANYTHING to do with Alexa. This is not one rogue experience. I have 5 echos in my place and have been using Alexa for 2 years now. It is an ongoing source of extreme frustration. You will put wayyyy more time into trying to get these to work than you save by their convenience the couple times per month they actually work as intended.I'm about ready to pull my hair out with how often this thing just randomly stops working. I have to reboot this thing weekly to get it to work. Totally defeats the purpose of having an Echo, when it's not working when you need hands free help, and you have to drop everything to unplug and plug it back in. The only improvement from gen 2 is the music sound quality. That is much better. However, responsiveness and functionality are way worse. I truly believe all these mega discounts we're seeing are so Amazon can get rid of its defective stock."	1	October 14, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Lack of volume ONLY when giving reminder.  Perfect otherwise.	3	November 30, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I loved everything about the echo except the voice quality. You cannot change Alexa s voice. She sounds muffled like when there is too much bass . We cannot understand her.  I tried to change it in the equilizer settings but it does not change her voice. I have a Google home mini and the voice is clear and sharp and I can understand everything said, even with the TV on and background noise. This really needs Improved upon. We only use it for a music source now.	3	March 20, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Not sure how outdated or old this product is but basically if you want something in your house that never does anything you tell it to do, no matter how many times you ask it - then this is the product for you.

Echo Dot	So, I have been using the new model echo for a couple of months. This new version has a better sound than previous generation products. However I am disappointed that it uses a new type of power charger. It does not have the standard micro usb  charging port that one has come to expect with the other amazon devices which I had come to really appreciate. In a pinch you could use a charging cable from another device. Instead this version uses an old school charging cable which means that if it fails, you cannot use the device. Other than that, it performs great.	3	November 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Elexa answers question but if they are umm risky in anyway she just says something like . I don‚Äôt know that one. Anytime you ask to play music they will play free music but it‚Äôs not the exact song your always looking for but it is the artist. It always mentions to pay the $3.99 per month for Amazon music. Then you can play any song you like. At night time the light around it is always flashing which I do not like. It‚Äôs in my room and I have been unplugging it at night time but then I‚Äôm not able to see what it‚Äôs like for Alexa to wake me up to music. I bought two of them at $24.99 so for the price it‚Äôs a good buy. We‚Äôll see how it goes. I thought it‚Äôd be more fun but it‚Äôs ok.	3	December 27, 2019	1

Echo Dot	Well IF you listen to secular stuff it is okay, BUT IF you listen to Christian OR conservative this thing AND alexa will turn THEMSELVES off all the time! I listen to rock and have NEVER had it turn off on me and I listen for HOURS! but the moment the husband turns on conservative radio about every fifteen minutes it just stops. WHY? why ONLY on those types of  radio? NEVER when the kids or I listen to it. so IF they think THEY can tell us what to listen to this way they are wrong, I will just spend my money somewhere else, thank you very much.I know some say the sound is not as good as others, and they are right. But for the price and to put in a room where you do not listen to a lot of music, I listen to music with the dot, but do not mind the bit of change, it does not sound bad, just a bit different.  But for the price I figured, yes I'm giving up my age, that it is like a bad stereo, where the speakers were not as good as more expensive ones.	2	May 12, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"We have long used and relied on Alexa in the living roon which was acivated on a computer in the same room.

Echo Dot	"The most innovative piece of hot tech garbage you'll end up using to just turn off your lights.Where to begin... I've owned it for two months, and as of a couple weeks ago, it decided to become hal 9000, ""I can't do that..."" (in a nutshell that's what it said)This is beyond a novelty item. I still battled the urge to just flip a switch, or since I bought the smart lights, just use the brand app on my phone. As alexa didn't want to work with those anymore. This thing has essentially been the bane of my existence. I had to constantly repeat myself. Other times I have to yell at it when I'm 3 feet away from it. I don't know if it's unable to pickup my deep voice, but it started feeling more an more flawed.I'm a programmer, video game developer professionally. I thought I'd use the alexa with the ifttt option to open scripts and programs, using a more reliable self made program than ""computer assistant"", that could essentially automate my home further than just using i the alexa as a TV remote and light switch.Ultimately, the thing stopped doing it's job, so the only enjoyable interaction I had with it was when I ripped it out of my wall, and sent it sailing into the rainy night of my backyard."	1	May 11, 2021	0
Echo Dot	1. They don't hear their activation word 90 percent of the time2. when they do 3/4 of the time they don't do what you asked them to do, or respond in an appropriate answer. 1/4 the time the wrong device will respond.3. They don't understand detailed systems. Meaning, if you don't just have a/c, but a/c 1, a/c 2, etc, it won't work. It cant pick up the defining character. Also, cant run my vaccum. It cant discern between start, and stop.4. They do not work as blue tooth speakers. Using a 2 different windows 10 computers, im convinced that they don't actually work. Sure, you might be able to get them to work for a few nights, but once you disconnect and reconnect a few times, they stop. Both of my pcs are now in a state where they can see the speakers via blue tooth, the echos see the pcs via their online site, but when the pc connects, the speaker is classified as other, and im not given to play audio through it. The echo, via its website, wont actually connect to either pc. No idea what thats about.5. Customer support is abysmal.I wish i could get my money back for all of the echos that i bought to put through out my entire home.	1	July 29, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Trying to figure what music to request  and then waiting to find out what Alexa would respond with became tedious.  It is much easier to grab an album and play it.  Also, there are times when Alexa goes into hiding.  For example, I'll ask for the temperature before I leave the house.  Alexa will flash some lights and not respond.  I'll repeat the request a few more times at difference speeds and tones, the same thing happens.  So, I'll grab my Samsung tablet, hit the weather app which responds immediately.That said, when it works properly it does some things worthwhile.  My conclusion is that robotics is a field with an impressive future and we are at the 1st of a hundred steps.  So, I will stay tuned and keep my tablet handy.	3	December 12, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Just got my Amazon Exho Dot 3rd gen. And it work well, like my 2nd gen EXCEPT Alexa sounds like she's speaking to me through a pillow! It's very annoying and yes , I used the Alexa app. to try to adjust the sound and it DIDNT work. My 2nd gen. sounds so much better. I'm going to try to exchange it and see if that helps. Unfortunately the sale was buy 1 get 1 free and I sent the other to my friend as a birthday present. I'm not sure Amazon will exchange just 1 because of the sale and I'm sure my friend will be disappointed. This will be his first experience with the Echo Dot and I think hell probably send it back to me. That's embarrassing and it sucks. My 1st gen works like a charm.

Echo Dot	I purchased this item for my son.  He uses it to speak to his dad on the phone at night.  I even purchased one for his dad to use at his own house.  After 6 months, my son's dot no longer works.  I have spent each evening this week trying to work through suggested ways to trouble shoot.  This did not work.  I spent more than one hour in a chat with 'customer service' and even had to send two emails showing the screen shot of my order page stating where I was eligible for a replacement for another 6 months.  After this, it was suggested at least 2x that I purchase a new dot to fix the problem because the part of my order where it says I am eligible for replacement is a web-site error that they aren't willing to stand by.I was planning on continuing to purchase more smart home items.  I have an echo show, fire stick and a plug.  After this customer service, that is better described as an impressive waste of a single mother's time, I will not dump anymore of my money into these products.  Yes they are cool and fun to use, however, when they break after a short amount of time I would expect a company which I give a significant amount of my money, to be able to help me out.I do not recommend that you waste your hard-earned money and time on any of the devices.  Customer service says it all for me.	1	July 16, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"At first I was impressed with the audio output. Music quality was quite an improvement over gen 2. Then ""she spoke""! Hard to believe this product would be released into the marketplace without addressing this issue. Voice output reminds me of someone talking with a pillow over their face (slight exaggeration). A fellow customer suggested using a bluetooth speaker which makes this device at least tolerable for the time being. With this supplemental accessory that I shouldn't have had to purchase, I can understand her answers to questions like ""What time is it?"" but when setting up timers or reminders the volume level drops to ""1"" making even the BT speaker ""fix"" unacceptable. Please address this with a firmware upgrade or whatever it takes or I will have to continue to convince anyone that asks that they should probably NOT get one."	3	December 15, 2019	1

Echo Dot	A dot is a dot except for the sound. I have been using 1st and 2nd gen dot's for a while and think that they are great. The sound of the dot 3 is not good. The sound reminds me of speakers that came from Japan in the 70s & 80s, lots of false base, not true quality sound you would get from say an AR speaker. I've tried to tone the base down using Alexa, but it didn't work. I've put the dot 3 in a room where it's not used much. I'd love to find couple of gen2 dots, even referbs, but they don't seem to be available on Amazon.	3	August 13, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I'm actually not impressed.  Maybe I don't have the patience to be an Alexa user or maybe it is just not designed to answer the kind of questions that I want to ask.  I was thinking of using it as a hands-free search engine.  However, there is no way to verify that the answer I am getting is based on the question that I actually asked.  It seems that Alexa does not understand all of the words and I can't tell what it missed.  Also, when it spits back names of famous people, for example, it slurs the names just enough so that I can't tell what the answer was.  I don't have that problem when I ask ""Ok google"" the same questions.I get the impression that I am supposed to spend a huge hunk of time trying to teach it to understand all of my electronics in the house.  I actually don't have all that much stuff that is internet capable, but what I do have is easy enough to control by using its interface.  I am not understanding the supposed advantage of arguing with Alexa to turn on the right thing verses just picking up a remote and pressing 2 buttons."	2	January 20, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I was exited to buy my first echo dot and I had to say I‚Äôm somewhat disappointed after four months of use.  Make sure you do your research and figure out if your home Technology Ecosystem works with Alexa.  The integration can‚Äôt locate one of my three Nest thermostats no matter how many times I run the locate feature. It also doesn‚Äôt tell you once you integrate them, your smartphone Nest app is rendered useless after that.  I have seven outdoor Blink cameras and it only finds five.  When I ask ‚ÄúAlexa shoe me my Deck camera.‚Äù It takes forever to actually render a decent picture on my tv.  (I have a strong WiFi signal).  Also has a slow connection to my Ring doorbell. By the time it shows the camera the person that rung the doorbell is usually gone. It controls my Sony Bravia tv sometimes and other times it just goes ‚ÄúMeh, sorry it‚Äôs not available right now.‚Äù  It has a temperamental relationship with my Directv DVR, some days it‚Äôs happy, other days not so much.  Amazon music feature is cool and music quality is good not great. You have to buy the big boy speaker (3rd gen) to get decent sound for a large home.  It‚Äôs clearly on the right path to full home smart technology integration... but it‚Äôs still a long way off from being truly reliable and useful. Works better for small homes, apartments, or townhomes with fewer devices. If you have a larger home it takes a little more time, patience, and a computer science degree to get everything working. I‚Äôll try again when Gen5 comes out.	1	March 6, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Just ok	3	January 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I'm not sure if I'm just unfamiliar with how to use the Echo device but Alexa doesn't have access to most of the features that I would expect it to. When it comes to controlling my smart devices it has a difficult time communicating or controlling my smart devices.  I give the sound quality 5 stars. But syncing the echo device with my Alexa app to give myself hands free control over my device's has been a little bit more difficult than I had expected. Over all it's a great device but it needs to have more detailed instructions for the hands free command features.	3	September 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Well Made and the tech is pretty stunning.  Initially really kinda cool, then they get a little creepy, are they listening? and then the coolness starts to fade.  We bought them last Xmas and one has been off line since June...no one noticed.  The other one appears to be online but we just don't use it.  We have tech savvy people in the house, but we forget it is there, until it glows or someone says Alexa.  The cost to have them control anything is pretty high, so we haven't done that yet.  we'll see...	3	November 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	We love the speech recognition when using the shopping list.Integration with our Amazon Music and our Playlists is continuously breaking up, stopping, skipping.  Our Echo sits right above our modem, so its not our internet.I use Amazon all the time and I love the Amazon music app on my cell phone, no issues.If I only wanted it to play our music, I would send it back, throw it away or burn it. This may sound harsh. It is.  I would love for someone at Amazon to call me and take care of it.	3	November 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa‚Äôs voice is in a difficult range for me to hear (I‚Äôm hard of hearing with mostly upper range loss), and she doesn‚Äôt enunciate well. Disappointed but not surprised it doesn‚Äôt have better accessibility options - I have Siri changed to a male voice that‚Äôs much easier for me, too bad Amazon didn‚Äôt do the same.	3	June 25, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Sooner or later these always crap out. The one I use now has trouble understanding what I say.  Reminder to go to the store, might be repeated as open the door. It's annoying as hell. I was given a new one for Christmas so today I decided to use it to see if it could hear better than the old one. It lasted about 3 hours before I hurled it out the door. I had the volume set where I could hear it very well when it replied to a question I would ask it. When it would announce a reminder the volume would be less than half of what it was set at. It wasn't loud enough for me to hear. That renders it worthless since I need the reminders because of my poor memory. I went back to using the old one that can't hear worth a damn. These are cheap electronics that will fail at some point in the future. I return them for replacement. There's loads of renewed ones because of the problems with them and the firestick devices. I keep extras on hand in case I hurl one out the door or put it under a car tire and flatten it out. It's a very aggravating thing for sure. Don't spend a lot for it because it is not worth it.	1	May 30, 2021	0
Echo Dot	My kids each got one for Christmas. They argue because they cannot play different music in each of their rooms. They have to listen to the same thing. Most times when you tell Alexa to play music it only plays in one of their rooms. As soon as you get it squared away and playing in both rooms someone asks it to play a different song and the whole annoying process has to start all over. Also, the question of the day is another problem. Both kids like to do it, but it only allows one of them to play. As soon as it is answered that‚Äôs it for the day on both echos which sparks another argument. Terrible, frustrating, annoying....thats what I think of the Amazon Echo. The only plus side is the sound quality.	3	January 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt.	3	November 30, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The quality of this Dot is not the best in the slightest bit. The audio is terrible, most likely because the cloth material surrounding the speakers dampens and muffles the audio. Voice recognition is decent. Alexa is not able to work with many of the features it is advertised with, which is a major downside. This Dot could be a lot better, and hopefully software updates improve Alexa over time.	3	May 30, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This does everything I wanted.  With a WiFi connection you can take this device anywhere.  Ask questions, use a timer, listen to music and keep time.  It does it all.	3	August 27, 2021	1
Echo Dot	it was nice but limited use so I gave it up lol	3	November 18, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I got this to replace my 1st gen. Echo, (which had better bass & resonance than this), but 1st gen's volume control is now shot. This is pretty good for letting me sing to tunes between choir rehearsals & I'll hope for continued good results from this nice sized unit.	3	July 7, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The speaker sustem works well enough, but Alexa has serious bugs and has trouble answering even simple questions.Example:  Ask Alexa to play music in a certain room. If music in already playing anywhere else, she will tell you that and ask if you want to play music where you requested.  YES, THAT'S WHY I ASKED!Example:  If you ever turn on the explicit music filter, it cannot be turned off.  Alexa will tell you it's off, but if you then request she play a song, she'll tell you she can't because the filter in on.  ARGH!Example:  If you request to play music using the app, it will always respond that there are no Alexa devices connected to the internet.  Wow, really?  I have 6 connected!Amazon tech support was no help fixing any of these issues.	3	August 29, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I use the dot mostly for information I am seeking from the World Wide Web, but 95% of the time I will ask Alexa a question and she will come back talking about some random crap, Not even close to what I asked. The echo dot is good for basic questions ie: what day is it, what time is it . If asked to remember something it does but often what it says is wrong. The sound is tinny and muffled at the same time, I usually will have to ask Seri the question to get a better response.	1	July 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It won't remember my name when I talk to it, it always calls me Jimmy (my fiance) even though I've been personally using it away from home for 2 weeks. Asked it to address my name and remember it and Still calls me Jimmy. Also, maybe this is only a fluke with mine, but my music cuts out when it plays for long periods of time. It still does everything else I need it for, just, it can be annoying.	3	April 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	it doesnt alway responds to the request it starts and then stops. Im unable to figure out why.	3	October 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"If you just want an alarm clock or listen to music, this is the item for you. But forget it if you want to use it for anything else. Setting up anything is a chore. Using the skills is like a bad relationship with Siri. They make it seem like you can talk to it like a human, but if you don't remember the actual name of the skill you want to use, and say  ""tell ______ to log ______"" it does something else entirely or says it's not sure. If by chance it opens the correct skill, you have to listen to a song and dance while it introduces the skill and asks you what you want - every time. I tried to use it for a diet and and had to enable and disable 6 skills before I realized that not one of them could log my food, count my calories and keep track of my weight all in one skill. I ended up having to use 3 separate skills. I could have jotted it down on a piece of paper 10 times faster.  My suggestion to Echo Dot is to cut out the small talk, make it really recognize what we're saying and remove all the half-assed skills until they're actually usable."	2	November 19, 2019	0

Echo Dot	As I purchase new items I will think of Alexa but as for now Alexa only controls two TV's in my house and the lightbulbs I purchased at Costco. Alexa is a great novelty but not completely useful in my house yet. Originally I was excited and purchased plugs to go with Alexa but was disappointed to learn they were only useful for light fixtures in my house, which are mostly on switches anyway, and bought the less expensive bulbs instead.	3	April 1, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"Got an echo dot and tried to hook it up to my computer system , which the instruction said I could, after trying several times and downloading software thru the apps store I was told that a needed a wireless device to set up the Dot.REALLY the reason I wanted this system is that it was advertised as being able to work thru my computer system.NO WHERE IN THE INSTRUCTIONS or on any website was there anything that said ""MUST HAVE WIRELESS DEVICE TO SET THIS UP"" to me this is a poor manual as well as a design flaw , not everyone wants to use their phone to set up a system that is advertised as working on a home computer. I mean how hard is it to have your product search and find my wireless system without me having to piggyback it thru another device.this is why I am giving this a low rating as I am also wondering how many others are giving this as a gift thinking the same thing only to find out that they need to have another wireless device to get this to do what it advertised to do.I will be returning this device for a full refund and warning others about this."	2	December 7, 2019	0

Echo Dot	This is my first robot. I love the way I can just ask it any question that pops into my head.  Alexa,  what are the bones in the ear. BAM. Also, it is way awesome as far as playing music. Just wake the genie in the hockey puck and about 85 percent of the time Alexia comes through with whatever tunes you desire. Plays all the iTunes you bought, can dial up radio stations, sports, whatever, the thing is beauteous. Back in the day R Crumb had a cartoon about a guy who lived and rode around in his bathtub. I can see this ridiculously affordable device (two six packs) putting me in such a state.  Why think, why move when you have this baby at your side.  Nirvana.Why then do I give this game changer one star? Simple. I got a black one. I like black. What engineer was the genius who decided to make the four simple control buttons on top of Dot 3 , the EXACT  same black color as the Dot casing?!? They are unreadable if they are more than 3 feet from your face!  Are you kidding me? My goal in life is to not have one of the fitness circles on my Apple watch budge. At all. Ever. Every time I need to fiddle with the mic, adjust the sound, reset the app , (which you might have to do if it is unplugged) on this hockey puck in a dimly lit room, I have to get up and get a friggin flashlight to distinguish between the four buttons!! They just blend into the rest of the gizmo. Engineering  crew. You owe me 50 push ups. Doh!	1	November 4, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I found Alexa very helpful and easy to use. I LOVE how she is bilingual and that‚Äôs a big plus. I can ask for stuff in English or Spanish and she would answer to both. But I totally hate Amazon music and I don‚Äôt like not one bit Spotify algorithm. So I am very disappointed that I can no use YouTube music with Alexa, to which I have a premium account. This is a big problem for me because I use Alexa mostly for music.	3	February 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I got alexa for a trial with XM radio.  The device worked as it should but i kept having the feeling i was being monitored.  This device feels so intrusive i‚Äôm not sure that even though i now have it unplugged and in a bag, i‚Äôm not convinced that it is somehow no longer still listening to me.  I‚Äôm debating whether or not to throw it in the trash.But i gave it 3 stars because it is easy to set up and works nicely, if one can tolerate having Jeff Bezos and his company listening in on one‚Äôs home.  It is freaky.	3	August 5, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"I bought this soley for the benefit of having a voice on command timer and speaker for my classroom. This thing was impossible to set up. It refused to connect to both wifi and Bluetooth. I thought I would still keep it just to use it to set timers, but it wouldn't even do that basic feature without being ""connected to wifi"".  I'm really surprised at how frustrating this was to try and set up for an Amazon product. Returned."	1	August 24, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It's not bad to set up, but some of the more sophisticated uses takes some digging and playing around to figure out. It has lost its connection for some unknown reason on occasion, which is annoying but not a game-ender. It has spontaneously started playing music, triggered by some unknown force. We are surprised at some of the simple requests or questions that it cannot handle or learn. I do worry about how much of unintended conversation or data is being collected and stored in that great concrete bunker in the sky (or Ashburn, as the case may be). Some uses require changes in the volume, up or down, from the current setting. It is a useful novelty...but duplicates the capabilities already present in most smart phones, only with a slightly larger speaker and mic.	3	December 24, 2019	1
Echo Dot	She doesn‚Äôt understand A LOT of commands. Things that you would think would be a no-brainer for her. We have to very clearly annunciate every word and syllable otherwise she gets it all wrong.  Also, trying to pair 3 devices in our household was a complete nightmare! Finally had to call customer support to walk us through it. Still can‚Äôt figure out how to use all 3 devices at the same time, however. The app isn‚Äôt very user friendly either. And when my children are playing games with her, she‚Äôll just quit right in the middle of it. But, when she does understand you, she only plays someone‚Äôs music in one room, she finishes a game or tells you the weather, keeps track of your shopping list, it‚Äôs great!	3	February 3, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Well I was hesitant to buy since it's always listening but the convenience of asking Alexa certain things say in the  dark is cool.  I bought 2 and  vran them in stereo for a day.  The sound quality is muffled it's missing mids and true bass.  So now I have one in the  kitchen and one in the bedroom no more stereo.  I find it very useful  as a timer since I cook a lot and time my morning french press with this puck.	3	December 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Amazon get it together! It's incredible that DOT 3 is not integrated to Fire stick in order to turn ON the TV in order to not have to use the remote control of the Fire stick to turn ON the TV! Or are you doing all this on purpose to sell the new Amazon CUBE? At least you least you should alert customers you are not giving this obvious feature with DOT 3 so one can evaluate and decide what product to buy. One can suppose that if you can use the Fire stick 4k remote to turn ON the TV you could also use DOT3 to ask Alexa via voice to turn ON the TV as well; the feature is still not yet supported according to DOT3 Tech Support  from Amazon.	3	January 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I bought a 55' amazon fire TV and an amazon echo dot for my wife who is paralyzed it simply doesn't work 50% of the time sometime's it will turn the volume up but not down sometimes it will turn the volume down but not up most of the time alexa just says fire TV dosn't support that but it dose because it works sometimes alexa won't turn the TV on or off at all Most of the time alexa won't switch the TV inputs for some reason a lot of the time I'll give alexa a TV comand and she'll turn on my Xbox iv gone through the alexa app were it lists what you said to alexa and what she did in response and you pick if alexa responded correctly alexa is supposed to learn from this but she doesn't and the alexa app rarely lists the commands she got right so basically Alexa has been pretty much worthless except for setting alarms, timers & turning my Xbox on & off which I have on a shelf out of reach it should be noted that a Amazon echo dot cost about $25 where a Amazon echo plus with built in hub cost $150 a big difference in price and probably a big difference in quality so I'm going to bite the bullet and try the echo plus I wouldn't bother normally but like I said my wife is paralyzed and if Alexa worked as advertised it would change her life a lot O and don't bother trying to make phone calls with Alexa she'll make the call but you can't hear the other person talking and the receiver only hears bits & pieces	1	December 27, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I compared this to my old second generation echo dot:1. The microphones are definitely worse. I have to get closer or shout to get it to listen to my command. Another Echo device usually would register my voice command downstairs first and not this one closer to me.2. The speaker out of the box got way too much bass. It gives you a false impression that music sounds better on this speaker, but it worked horribly when I tried to use it for Audible3. Luckily we can adjust the bass/treble/mid in the Alexa app or use voice command to do that now. It sounds a lot better now after adjustment	3	June 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	When I try to end a call Alexa tells me ‚Äútheres no active call‚Äù yet there is and im stuck recording on someones answering machine with no inability to hang up. When i give clear instructions like ‚ÄúAlexa play a tale of two cities by J cole‚Äù she will play something like ‚Äúok i am playing metamorphasis by hilary duff‚Äù ??? The living room and kitchen echos are constantly mixing each other up. Ill be in the kitchen asking a question and the living room goes off but then when i ask the living room to stop there is no response. Sound quality is bad but thats expected for a $30 speaker. Sometimes when im having an important conversation for work she thinks im talking to her and will start going off. When i ask a simple question that warrants a one word answer like a kitchen measurement conversion she goes off on an unrelated tangent about some recipe listing 50 ingredients but fails to answer the simple question.  id only recommend if you want a device to make your blood boil and piss you off 3-4x a day. Major work needs to be done to consider her a help rather than a pest.	1	November 12, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I got this to listen to music in rooms where I don't have speakers.  Pop is there on command, classical music by a specific musician or conductor, or worse a complete opera sung by a specific artist Alexa can't find it.  Even if I am looking at the subscribed to, prime music page repeating to Alexa the exact information listed there (remember, I'm paying a subscription to use) and Alexa can't find it...(and won't stream to the dot instead of on computer either only reminding I can only play from one location) If by rare chance I do get my request, if I ask for it again the next day using the same words...Alexa can't find it.  Other chores Alexa works fine...but not classical music.  Rap/Hip Hop on command... Ariadne auf Naxos you're out of luck.	2	July 12, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The only reason it gets 2 stars instead of one is the sound quality and operation after setup.... However.. Here's why I gave it a low rating: I have a galaxy note10+ and high speed wireless at home and it was absolute BS trying to get the effing thing connected to my phone and internet both. The setup mode is an utter joke. Once connected it works great, but man, I wanted to do Alexa connected lighting as well but now it's a he|| no from me. I had it in setup mode 15+ times and my last try before I gave up it finally connected. I didn't change anything about the order of the way I tried to connect it or anything, and followed the directions to a tee in the Alexa app. I'll stick to my google assistant and a regular Bluetooth speaker, thanks.	2	May 26, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I received this as a promotional item and was curious to compare it to my Google Home mini system that exist in my house now. Overall I'm slightly disappointed when comparing the two systems. The sound quality from Alexa is much better however everything falls flat for me. Ive had several devices to randomly remove themselves after adding them into my groups. I find myself arguing with the Alexa system after giving simple commands and it not registering what I said. The only reason I'm keeping this speaker is to use it as an audio speaker in my garage.	3	October 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	After a year of using my Echo Plus as an alarm clock in my studio apartment, I found myself missing it when I moved into a place with walls. I bought the Dot when it was on sale for $29.99 because, not only did I now need one for my bedroom, but it was cheaper than a lot of alarm clock options. The best of both worlds. WELL. The error message of Not Being Able to Connect to the Internet became a daily problem very quickly. I tried every troubleshoot from every blog I could find, and I spent quite some time on the phone with amazon trying to figure out why it wasn‚Äôt working. Surprise! If it isn‚Äôt connected to the internet, the alarm won‚Äôt go off. So I woke up late for work and decided it was the last straw. I think I got a dud and it‚Äôs going back.As if this wasn‚Äôt already kind of disappointing, I am not allowed to do an even swap for a new Dot. The only option I was given, aside from mailing it in and having techs look at it for an undisclosed amount of time was to return it (since I am still within the return window.) However, the price has risen to $49.99, so if I want a new one I have to pay the difference, which is ridiculous. My Echo Plus stays connected just fine. And the Dot was maybe 20 feet from my router, so, again, I think I just got a dud. It‚Äôs disappointing that they couldn‚Äôt do an even exchange of a Dot for a Dot, especially since this thing stopped working almost immediately. And frankly, when it worked it was a cool gadget, but I am not sure it‚Äôs worth $50.	1	September 5, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Dif√≠cil de emparejar por Bluetooth	3	December 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"To be very honest, this product is very well built, sound quality is amazing, very loud, and it picks up your voice very well. I enjoyed having this device and playing around its different features and skills that it has. What I do not like about this product, which you might agree on, is when you ask Alexa Questions. Asking questions, often it will say something along the lines of ""I don't know,"" or give you a different answer to what it is that you want. Comparing Alexa Echo Dot to the Google Mini, they both are good products. But If you are looking to ask more questions and such, I say maybe the Google Mini would be the best bet, since the Mini uses Google to find its information while Alexa only uses Wiki."	3	December 18, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Alexa will pick up what you say half the time, though doesn't always understand what you say. Very very rarely will the dot follow through with commands, and many skills don't seem to work either. Any time I ask for music to play it just repeats the command before the light ring goes gray (as with many other commands). Really glad this was a promotional gift and not something I'd spent my money's worth on, because it just about never seems to do any commands correctly, if at all. Even on day one it was semi functional at best, and only went downhill from there. I usually try to leave at least one positive thing on my reviews, however.. I just can't seem to find something I can praise it on, except for maybe it telling me when something has been delivered (which my text/email notifications do anyway). All in all, I can't say I would recommend this product, perhaps the Echo is more functional than the Dot? Can't add anything on that behalf, but best of luck.	2	September 14, 2020	0
Echo Dot	So I got this for free. I wouldn‚Äôt buy this since I have no real use for it so I can‚Äôt really speak for value money wise. Voice recognition seems pretty good. Sound quality is ok with music, normal talking isn‚Äôt as clear. I have not really done much with Alexa except to ask if I have a notification. Or the weather. I don‚Äôt really see the need for weather as I have a phone and a smart watch.	3	March 5, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"Received this is a Christmas gift from my husband and overall it's neat and I enjoy listening to music and NPR while making dinner. HOWEVER....it tends to cut out halfway through songs and move on to the next one without prompting. It also gets ""stuck"" on the blue light with no response to a request from time to time. I've dealt with flashing lights of red, yellow and green, with no messages or calls waiting, and no reason for the lights (when red is flashing, all our other wifi using devices are doing just fine). It's a little frustrating, especially with no recourse to fix the issue, since I'm not sure where it's stemming from. The Alexa app hasn't been very helpful in these instances either. But when it works, it's fun."	3	January 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I used to love my Alexa. I loved it do much I bought one for every floor in my house and a couple rooms. We love music so it was nice to play music all over the house but the songs we listened to the most all of a sudden could only be played with music unlimited. We would listen to a song for like a week without unlimited and the next day it would no longer be available. It‚Äôs really annoying but a market strategy. Now I just get frustrated that I can‚Äôt listen to the same music I listened to the day before.	3	August 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I specifically ordered the dot with a smart bulb so I had a bonus. Everything worked just fine for several days but then Alexa told me that things weren't connected right and I had made no changes. I unplugged both the bulb and the lamp with no success. I guess it's most frustrating because I have no place to call to have someone help. The dot works fine and the speaker picks up from the adjoining room better than I expected.	3	February 26, 2021	1

Everything is pushed towards voice and I just want to navigate to where I need to be bc the voice results are not helpful.In the end, this device just does not work. Maybe this one is defective, but being a 3rd gen device, things should just work by now.Begging Amazon to do better.	1	May 29, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I bought an extra speaker for my bedroom because I need music to sleep, and at least three nights a week, the music stops playing overnight repeatedly, which wakes me up every time it happens. If I have Spotify set to play a playlist on a loop, then that's what should happen on the Echo. I'm not sure if it's a setting on Echo to stop playing after a certain period of time, but I have searched through all the settings and tried replacing the speaker with no improvement. When I tell a program to play music on a loop, that is what I expect it to do until I tell it to stop. I will have to get a regular bluetooth speaker because Echo is not capable of doing the job CD players mastered twenty years ago.	2	July 21, 2021	0
Echo Dot	We have Amazon Echo and Alexa devices in ever room of our house. We have a Flex plug in our small bedroom but decided because of good reviews to replace with the Dot. Sorry to say the sound quality is really bad. Super muffled even with bass down and treble turned up we can't get it to sound good.I'm not one who is really picky about sound quality so for me to complain is a big deal.I don't get it, the Echo's are such amazing products, why is it so hard to get good speaker quality from the Dot??	3	September 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	meh, I'll be honest I use it as an alarm, i thought it would synch to tv as an extra speaker nope. my name is alex and i was hoping i could make alexa a hot male. nope. now i wonder if this was a ploy so it can listen to me cuz Alexa for me does not meet my needs or even funny fantasy of Alexo. alexa doesnt support my LGBT lifestyle. I want alexa to coddle me. oh well Alexa is just my Alarm. and ps it's useless if it's not connected  or if there is no wifi. I may be wrong but that's all I got out of it. but hey for other people it's great if you have amazon music and whatever else u can afford	3	January 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I was loving having Alexa in my house. I loved that she would sync with att and i could make and receive phone calls through all my devices. I actually got 2 echo dots and and an echo show to cover all rooms in house. The devices would also control my fire tvs. NOW... It does none of the sort and Alexa doesn't understand a word i say. She gives the strangest responses or doesn't respond at all. She does random stuff like play music or tell a story without me asking her. I've contacting customer service multiple times about the phone call issue and have gotten no resolution. I give up..i can't even get Alexa to play music. Ill ask for one type of music and she gives me something totally different. with every command, it usually ends in ""Alexa stop"". It's gotten intolerable.. I barely use my devices anymore. They are useless"	1	March 16, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I bought this hoping it would sync with my echo plus and I could listen to the same music in two different rooms.  The dot and the plus work well independently but they do not work together.  I spent 1/2 hour on with the chat tech and she got it to work one time.  It does not work if I move the dot - I am very disappointed.  Both hooked up to the same wi-fi and amazon account.	2	December 11, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I have both Echo Dot 2, 3, Echo Show 5 / 8. I love the Echo Dot 2.The Echo Show 5 is located in the bedroom while the Echo Dot 3 is sitting in the leaving room. I haven't started using the 8 yet. I bought to keep in touch with my family. I wanted kids to be able to drop-in anytime while I am in the field.The Echo Dot 3 works fine but I have to come closer for it to pick my voice command easily while the Echo Show 5 picks it on the first attempt. I have also noticed that putting them side by side the Echo Show 5 response to voice command is faster than the Echo Dot 3.	3	February 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Voice recognition started becoming more difficult after a year. Speaker is now going out.My parents echo is still going strong after several years, so I know this is not necessarily the norm. Just disappointed that mine is no longer working.	2	April 16, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I bought the echo dot thinking it would play music, act as a speaker really.  I wasn't that interested in having it tell me when to exercise or what to make for dinner or whatever.  And it's possible that I simply don't know how to ask the right way or some other technical knowledge that I lack.  But I can't seem to get it to answer the questions I ask or play music the way I want it to and since that's the main reason I bought it, I kindof think it SUCKS and is frequently more frustrating than effective.	3	August 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa works great, however whenever I asked to lower the volume down or to turn the volume up it wont do so or increases it to full max which is a shock when your lying in bed. I've returned this product and exchanged it twice and still having same issues as the prior one.	2	March 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Very good product. Was easy to set up and connect almost everything. It‚Äôs not compatible with my cameras but that‚Äôs why only 3 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è  Otherwise I would of gave higher if it was compatible with at least one camera. Very good speech recognition tho. My two year old granddaughter loves it and Alexa understands her sometimes when I don‚Äôt and plays her songs. She‚Äôs so smart.	3	May 11, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I rarely write reviews but I felt this was worth writing a review aboutSo last year I bought the Echo Dot (2nd Gen) and fell completely in love with it. The voice recognition was on point and although the sound quality could be better, it worked for what I needed.I bought the 3rd gen this year and tbh I‚Äôm pretty disappointed. Yes the sound quality improved, and the features have expanded.However the voice recognition is absolute crap.I have to repeatedly tell it to do something and it ends ups doing something else. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I switched it with my 2nd gen in the bedroom so that it stays outside JUST for music. So now I use my 2nd gen echo for all my daily tasks instead.	3	December 12, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"I have an older gen Alexa ""tower"". She was very responsive. Her cousin Dot, seems to pretty much give you the finger.I say, Alexa and there is no response. I repeat a second time and maybe about 50% of the time she will respond. 3rd time with the wake word is generally when she will come around.Don't get me wrong, I like dot. I do! She can be quite sassy at times. If you don't expect a a response the first time, you'll be fine. The sound quality is okay. Not concert  hall quality, but okay. Nothing to write home about and I definitely wouldn't say that to Alexa."	3	June 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Music plays really good, could use a little more bass, but not bad for the price.The only knock, is the voice when Alexa speaks. Very muffled at low volume (<4 volume level). It‚Äôs like someone has their hand over her mouth. From 5 feet away, I can only understand about 20% of what she says. I see other people recommend hooking up and external speaker to the Auxiliary port, but that‚Äôs just too much work. I believe this is the 3 gen, so I‚Äôm a little surprised to see these types of problems. Echo team needs to get this fixed ASAP before I think about buying another.	3	July 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have three Echo Dot's and two google's.  I am older and can't hear the female,ONLY, voice on the dots as well as the males on the googles.  She is very helpful etc, but doesn't help that I can't hear her as well.  It would be nice to have a choice between voices as on Google.  I don't think the quality of speaker is as good on the dot also.	2	December 29, 2021	0
Echo Dot	This thing is terrible. I'm in setup trying to get it to connect to my wifi and it keeps telling me the password is wrong. I have double and triple-checked it and the password is correct. This device is utterly worthless to me because it isn't capable of connecting to my wireless for some unfathomable reason. It spends 10 minutes trying to find the wifi signal despite the thing being less than a foot from my router, and then has the gall to tell me that the wifi password is wrong. I don't know what is actually wrong with it and at this point I've stopped caring. I got this thing for a dollar on a deal and I still regret that purchase as it's worth considerably less than $0.99. Absolute garbage.	1	April 27, 2022	0

Echo Dot	When we first got this we loved it but now none of them work well at all. They all went bad at the same time. You literally have to scream at the  things to get them to listen and when they do listen they do  everything but. God forbid you ask it to stop chiming your morning wake up alarm because you have to scream at it and wake up the rest of the house. Don't buy these things they are no good after a year.Update clearly Amzon is aware of the failures because now it is asking me if I had to ask it more than once.Now if only this one did it I would understand but all of mine do it.Buy Google.This thing is garbage	1	April 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I havr to screen at it to get it to listen half thr time it sits 3 feet from me at my desk and still has issues	3	September 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Honestly, not certain I am going to keep it, yet.  Voice recognition is fairly good, but you have to use very specific phrases for the dot to understand what you are asking.  The Alexa app drains my phone battery by keeping the location on.  I don't have any other smart home devices, so I am not reaping the benefits of the dot as much as I had hoped.  It is, however, nice on a few levels.  I like adding things to the shopping list via voice command, It would be nice to be able to replace the Amazon shopping list with the list app of your choice, so that you don't have to say the magic words to get it to add to the correct list.	3	December 24, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The Echo Dot has a lot of great uses, but it falls terribly short with when it comes to playing music. It worked great for months, we have a total of 4 Dots and one Echo show and it was great having music throughout the house. Randomly they would quit playing music and have static. It isn't all of them at once, it is one at a time. Sometimes they work great, other times they won't even play. It isn't the internet because the other ones are still playing. It isn't the distance because they are in the same place there they were when we didn't have any problem. There isn't any electrical interference. Nothing changes when it works and when it doesn't. The product itself is just inconsistent. Next purchase will be Google.	1	April 29, 2022	0

Echo Dot	As we all know, it is always useful to have an Echo at home because Alexa is useful for many things that you should remember during the day, ask questions or simply tell her that you want to listen to your favorite song.  The size depends on how you prefer it and the money that each person wants to invest.  Personally, this Echo has worked very well for me, the volume and sound quality are very good, also the size and weight is ideal to take anywhere.  Until now I have never had connection problems, however the voice recognition fails several times	3	July 28, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"We liked our first generation Echo Dot, so when the newest one went on sale for $22 for Christmas we purchased one to get a ""new and improved"" model. Alexa's voice on the new one is best described as muffled, sometime to the point of being unintelligible. My wife is not at all happy with this. We never had this problem with our old one. Attempting to adjust the EQ in the Alexa app had no affect on this muffled speech problem and seemed to only change EQ parameters for playing music. By the way,  music does sound better on the 3rd generation DOT. Still, for a newer model that should be an improvement, Amazon took one step forward (music) and two steps back (voice) on the new Dot."	3	December 26, 2019	1

Echo Dot	A few things have made me hate this product over time, and are why I'm replacing it with a google nest speaker this week.First, it's not nearly as intuitive with voice commands as I'd hoped. If I ask how cold it is out, I don't get the current temperature, I get the low. I have to specifically ask what the current weather is, and then I'll get what I wanted. When connecting smart bulbs to it, the colors are ALL messed up and very limited, compared to using Google home as an app on my phone, or my best speakers. Most importantly, I dropped spotify and took up YouTube Music, because the algorithm was better. Found out that this brick is incompatible with that service, and if I want to use it I'll have to use my phone and connect it to my speaker.I really regret purchasing what is now going to be a paperweight. Is there a buyback program? Ugh.	2	December 6, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I am not really happy with my Echo Dot.When I ask Alexa to play my radio station she does however it turns it off soon after.

Echo Dot	"I bought this product pretending to have a more simple life, but instead I have the opposite.Sometimes it won't recognize my voice (I have to call her twice or even 3 times). If I ask her to do something like ""turn off light"" she turn off the fan instead. She often loose connection of the light bulb and I have to re-pair the device. From time to time it gives me the red ring, and I have to wait a couple of minutes to use the device again. It doesn't have a lot of features like the Google Home Mini, such as telling your phone battery %, etc.And the list could go a long way, but let's just leave it here.

Echo Dot	I like the device when it worked for me. I suppose I don't know yet how to operate this device. I guess my computer has to be on and Alexa app open  before it works.

Echo Dot	I only got this because I have 1000s of dollars of Ring products and the echo is what is needed to get the cameras to show motion alerts on my amazon brand TVs.

Echo Dot	I like it but it needs improvement.  I have it plugged into better speakers so not an issue for me but it would be if I had to rely on the unit itself.  I'm guessing most people that care are using other speakers.  It quits playing music several times at night and I have to tell it to resume.  Also, disappointed that I cannot set up different music streaming in routines by using the timer.  In other words, if I want to set jazz for two hours and then lullabies for six hours, I can't do it because the music is grayed out after choosing it once.  Music also grays out if you choose something like reading a bible verse.	3	January 4, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I have three of these devices in my home, mostly as speakers, and mostly to listen to music and the radio. The unfortunate thing is that the radio station I listen to most often (CBC Radio 1) isn't recognized by the device's voice recognition in any way. It's like it... doesn't recognize the existence of Canada. Not sure why. Tech support is useless. Other complaint I have is that it really struggles with voice commands. Finally, with this one-- not with my other ones- it will often just stop playing music from my Pandora. This is true if I activate it from the phone or verbally from the device itself. Not sure why, and, again, tech support is utterly useless. I will update if anything changes.	3	January 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have been curious about this item for a number of years but never could bring myself to buy one because it doesn't seem to do much that other technology doesn't already do.  Black Friday I finally broke down and bought one because my curiosity got the better of me.  Maybe it will grow on me over time but it won't control a Samsung TV without an expensive adapter and if I wanted to I can already talk to my tv remote.  It answers questions but so does my phone.  It controls smart devices, with an additional hub, but so does my phone without the hub.  This all leaves me with my original question,  what is it good for?	3	January 16, 2020	1

Echo Dot	The tone is terrible so that when she responds I can hardly understand what she is saying.

Echo Dot	I like the product, however, inside the dot, there are electronics that for what ever reason, the user can't utilize. Other companies like Sony sell products with very similar parts, that do the same thing, however the owner can actually use the parts.	3	July 1, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The device itself is fine. Understands my voice well enough and the sound quality is good. That being said, there are some issues we ran into while setting it up. The Dot for some reason was set to using a different language and was actually set to a different region than where my account is located. I'm in the US but it set it up as a Japanese Echo. Japanese voice over and Japanese UI in the app. It took multiple resets and even changing my password multiple times to fix. It also defaulted to using an old phone number of mine when I tried setting it up. I had to create a new profile for it to use my current number. When playing Amazon Music, the songs have a tendency to stop abruptly and sputter out, although I'm not entirely sure if it's the device or the Music service that could use some fixing up. The various skills you can enable and the customizable routines are a nifty experience, which, coupled with the smart organizer functionality keeps the Dot from being a straight one star.	2	May 14, 2020	0

Echo Dot	The speakers are nice, but when I got the dots (I got two), I didn't know I had to get the unlimited music for each speaker. I feel like if you purchase the Echo and pay monthly to have the unlimited music and you order the dots and sync them then you should automatically get the unlimited music for all speakers. I mean you pay $80 plus monthly for the Echo so you should get the music if you buy the dots. It's kinda bad business. Reward your customers if you're buying the dots too. Kinda disappointed!	3	September 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I'm still learning how to use it so I don't think this is a really fair review.  She is limited on what she knows compared to Siri.  I like that it is a speaker but it isn't rechargeable and you have to have it connected to a battery power pack for it to work.  It isn't as loud as I thought it would be...‚Ä¶.I guess i would have known that if I actually checked.  The plus side so far is that her voice is much better than Siri.  She has picked some really great stations to listen to so far.  She has recited the Lord's prayer :)  She has a really great alarm not as blaring as most alarms.	3	January 2, 2020	1

Echo Dot	My echo dots cannot hear me when I‚Äôm in the same room as it but my echo flex in the bathroom down the hall hears me no matter where I am in the house. This even happens when I‚Äôm standing two feet from an echo dot. What gives???	3	June 10, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"After years of resisting ""smart"" assistants, we caved and got this to help with a family member's ADHD. Now we can set morning routines for waking up and getting ready for school, timers for lunch, etc., and reminders to stop goofing around and start homework. This echo is actually our THIRD, because now we have one in both kids' rooms and one in the kitchen. No more yelling upstairs when dinner is ready, or it's time to go somewhere. Alexa gets it done."	3	December 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Have to tell it multiple times to turn on lights, etc. Almost never works on first try. Mics are very bad as well. Google home is a better product all the way around.	1	October 27, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Voice recognition technology not yet a defined art.  Admittedly, I am an Alexa-novice but find difficulty in getting concise answers to carefully framed questions beyond the time and predicted weather.Also have some security concerns with the technology in general but not with Alexa-specific.In the short time since I've purchased the Alexa module, I have more questions than answers.  Not interested in reviewing reams of printed instruction for a device that should be intuitive.Alexa and Siri are early in their evolution but have promising futures for all things technological.Interestingly , her knowledge of differential calculus is impressive.Wish I had her 50 years ago in deference and reverence to my slide-rule.

Echo Dot	I‚Äôm writing a review after speaking to 3 different amazon tech people on the phone. Not only does my echo dot not respond to my commands and cuts out the music (an issue they could not resolve), but it also told me that my SISTER had new texts. When I asked tech about this, concerned that this was a security breach since neither me nor my sister had put her number or access on my echo, they had NO explanation, only saying that her number must‚Äôve ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù been added to my account. I could not see this from my end of the app. When I spoke to a supervisor about this, he rudely told me that this was not possible and treated me very poorly. I tried telling him again, that while it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot possible‚Äù, it did happen and I am concerned about privacy now. He said ‚Äúim not sure why you‚Äôre calling, that is not a security breach because it‚Äôs not a random number.‚Äù Random or not, I should not have access to someone else‚Äôs texts. That IS a security breach. I am extremely disappointed in not only their service, but now I‚Äôm concerned that my number could ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù be added to random peoples accounts without knowing and that they have access to my messages. Unacceptable.	1	March 5, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Let me start by saying Amazon devices are the LAST thing i would buy.This echo dot was gifted to me so that's why i have it.I like the sound output but I HATE HATE that i have to have Alexa on my phone since I've heard how intrusive it is. I would have prefered to have a choice to use Bluetooth without Alexa like i use with other non Amazon decices.When it comes to devices I will stick with Samsung, Sony, LG and üçé. This is not for me.	3	September 29, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This product is a gift. So far I use it for alarm setting and time checks . My daughter's reason for gifting it is for security in case I fall. I can call her or 911 if I need assistance. My only negative is Alexa asking if I wanted to signup for Amazon Music. My 4 year old grandson  said yes. Too much hassle to cancel it. Should have been easier.	3	February 23, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Though the product is wonderful in many ways  The disadvantages of accepting Amazon Echo user agreement render it too invasive without some legal assurance of privacy. Amazon, like Google and other techno giants have become suedo-governmental propaganda agents. These technologies are being used to subvert or rights. The monitoring of our activities and censoring of speech are just the precursor for what will be much worse without limitations mandates by law. It‚Äôs time go break up the information distribution network monopoly held by Amazon and its partners in their agenda to steal power over every aspect of people‚Äôs lives.  No way will I help destroy Democracy . Take a stand today. Tune out the 24/7 spying !	1	May 10, 2022	0
Echo Dot	This product doesn't work well at all. You can not make out what Alexa is saying or talking about . Its not clear what she's talking about. To much base in the speech,  Muffled...unable to make out anything	2	April 5, 2022	0

Echo Dot	If you use spotify and want a group speaker system. Go with google. Not only is the sounds about a 3 with the echo system.  It disconnects constantly from spotify in a group speaker set up.  I Have a google house that works flawlessly and sounds better.  Tried the echo system at work due too its aux output I can attach speakers too. That worked. Sound was ok.. but having to reconnect to spotify constantly is a pain.. no answers from amazon or spotify on this issue...	3	October 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Had it running for about a day. As soon as my 3 kids realized ANY of them could say ""Alexa do this, Alexa do that"" one after another, it turned into chaos. Unplugged it and haven't touched it in a month. Would be better if it only obeyed my voice and not everyone else's. Didn't return it only because it was free for renewing our Verizon Fios service."	3	March 20, 2021	1
Echo Dot	When I tried to play my Apple Music in my app I have to have a separate speaker to attach to the echo. The echo does play the Apple Music I can‚Äôt choose from my playlists.	3	July 27, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"Love all the echo loving reviews.  The truth is, its a dumb box.  If that works for you, great.  Just not there, and to imply its better than that, is a lie.  Its okay.  I find myself repeating myself a lot.  Plus, I'm already sick of, ""can you repeat that"", ""I don't understand that"".  Yes, I repeat and I do the exact same way, and magic...it works.  NOT THERE.  When it works cool.  FYI, only use this for music and, some timers.  The main problem does seem to be music request.After having this thing for awhile now, I can say my feelings have not change.  Two things have really gotten on my nerves.  One, I ask for a song, and it spits out not part of your songs or prime (that is fine), but here is a play list you might like.  What the ?????  I didn't ask for a play list, I asked for a song.  Just say you don't own, and its not part of prime.  Thanks.  Done.  Plus, when you say cancel, it is on some kind of mission at that point because it will not.  So you have to repeat yourself a few times.  Annoying.The other thing, when you tell it it got something wrong, it wants to ask for feedback every time, but it doesn't learn, so you tell it to stop, and guess what, it repeats.  The devs are clearly not the brightest out there.  This thing is sooo clunky, its painful."	1	December 26, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I have the echo 5 and this dot, i cannot even use the dot. It never plays what i ask, pretty much just free rolls, absolutely ridiculous.	1	November 10, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The auxiliary jack is for output to another speaker or headphones only. The only audio input is through Bluetooth, so it won‚Äôt work at my workplace. Also, no internal battery, or USB, this needs to be plugged into the wall in order to operate. This is only useful in a home or office, not something I can throw in my bag and take to my farmers market stand.	2	December 24, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I have it hooked up to a smart plug which controls my lights, I enjoy being able to walk in the door with my arms full, or not have to find a wall switch in the middle of the night I can ask for my lights to turn on. However.. its recently been having problems connecting to internet only this device in our entire home and will frequently not respond or be able to do anything and I'm finding a hard time with it hearing my voice from acrossed the room even if you yell.. I seem to now have to be within about 2 feet of the device to get a response now... the occasional time it does work.	3	January 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I've had the Dot for a few years and the sound quality is now awful.  I don't really use it often for music, but when I do it sounds terrible.  The software is up to date.  I hate the sound.  It is very distorted.	2	March 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt like the fact that you need to talk to her really proper for it to understand you. I love the bass in my music though.	3	August 18, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I was under the impression that Alexa was to be better then Google. But Alexa answers everyone that walks in the door we‚Äôre I set up Alexa and should only take my voice.  I have a wyze locks and Cameras in my home.  I‚Äôve tested 5 different people and they were able to unlock my door with a 4 digit code I made. A long side my cameras also.  If Google can tell if it is me or not is a better product in my eyes and will say with Google for now on.	2	October 25, 2021	0
Echo Dot	First of all, it's a super helpful product. Makes it easy to control your lights, nest thermostat, etc. However... if you intend to use it to play music around the house, I suggest getting a larger version than the dot. I don't blast music by any means... nor do I use it for music very often... but 8 months after purchase, the speaker is already blown out. My recommendation is to go with a larger product with better speakers. That way you can control your devices AND play music.	3	October 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I mean, why wouldn‚Äôt this hold even the slightest charge when it is unplugged???  Such a weird thing.  I guess no battery allows it to be so cheap, but man.It‚Äôs an echo.  Nothing truly exciting about it, other than a sense of convenience.  Sound quality isn‚Äôt the best, it doesn‚Äôt pick up WiFi as strong as other electronics in the same place do.  Also, I feel like I‚Äôm fighting to get Alexa to understand what I mean, even if I use exact commands.  Whatever.  It‚Äôs an echo and I got it for free, so I guess it lives it‚Äôs purpose.	3	April 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs almost as if they make Alexa dumb on purpose after just a few months of use. It orders things for pay when I say something totally different. I literally have to scream 3-4 times to turn off the lights. I try to play a song and she plays something totally different. I schedule it to start meditation sounds in the morning so I can wake up peacefully and it announces LOUDLY that it‚Äôs playing this. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I do to change this. Features like this that were once easy to work are no longer. Very annoyed, wasted so much money. Glad it arrived late and I didn‚Äôt get a chance to give this garbage as a gift.	1	May 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I have no idea how to use it so I don't know if it works or not.  I need someone to show me what to do with it. When I learn what to do with it, I will revise my rating.	2	March 28, 2022	0
Echo Dot	it just looks blah	3	November 16, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Compared to a suite of other assistants I have this is by far the worst performing out of all of them. The voice recognition is terrible and the audio quality is subpar. Along with this, Alexa itself is a flawed assistant and will often not understand contextual information nearly as well as her counterparts. Would certainly recommend something like a GHome over this.	2	January 6, 2022	0
Echo Dot	voice is muffled and not clear. instructions for operation are non-existent. costs for features are hidden. could be a good feature if there were instructions you could follow w/o internet. will turn off TV but won't turn it on. you will never respond directly to a customer.	2	March 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	We like this device, but after they start doing this:For experiences like Echo Dot Kids Edition, we need permission to collect personal information, including voice recordings. Your permission will apply to Amazon‚Äôs collection of personal information in connection with all Alexa devices, skills and other Amazon kid services.Hell No!!!I don‚Äôt give a ‚Äúamazing time‚Äù for their reasons to take my family personal information ‚Ä¶.!!!! People wake up, this is just part of Online store who start doing same think like a government ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Looks like they don‚Äôt car about privacy !!!So we just thrown into trash can and canceled all services.

Echo Dot	This was a second Amazon Echo for me. This time I purchased the Dot for my office at a great Black Friday Sale. The sound is amazing. The downfall for me was I thought like my Echo I could move it around the house not being plugged in but you can't, it just turns off. Also I thought I would be able to play separate music while my husband was exercising in another room playing music with the Echo. It wouldn't let me saying for $15.00 a month I can play separate music or link same music that my husband was listening to. So that was very disappointing. Now I just can't do it the same time he is using it.	3	January 7, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"There are lots of reports of the Alexa ""voice quality"" on the Echo Dot 3 and I wish I had paid more attention. Although the system works as designed ""Alexa"" is muffled and very difficult to understand. As others have suggested (and without much luck) I've adjusted the Bass, Treble and Midrange but it really does not help."	2	January 21, 2022	0
Echo Dot	My Alexa constantly seems to rarely hear me correctly, answers the wrong questions, sometimes doesn‚Äôt hear me at all when I say her name repeatedly,, shuts off or changes songs for absolutely no reason...  this happens so often I find myself asking Alexa ‚Äúwhat happened‚Äù (to which she doesn‚Äôt know), or, if I‚Äôm getting really mad, I‚Äôll ask ‚Äúare you stupid‚Äù?! (to which she literally shuts herself off lol)... She in fact just told me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that One‚Äù and I‚Äôm literally just sitting here not speaking.  I had the very first Alexa and it was great, only thing better about this one is it gets louder. I find myself shouting her name so often my neighbors probably think my lovers name is Alexa, or perhaps the name of my disobedient dog!	3	September 15, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Can‚Äôt get both echo products to play at one time. Remote only pairs with one echo and since pairing it with the dot, I can‚Äôt get it to pair back to my original echo. It‚Äôs aggravating!	3	July 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I was gonna use the echo dot primarily for playing music for when I sleep cause I sleep during the day time. I work overnight so having soft music to drown out the traffic noise really helps me. BUT the echo dot doesn't want to connect to my Spotify account. I did all the necessary steps again and again but no luck. It worked and connected the first couple of days but then after a few days it would not connect, it's frustrating. It works fine with pandora and amazon music but those two platforms DOES NOT have as big of a music library as Spotify and also Spotify has the type of music I need. Also I would say ""Alexa play soft piano music on Spotify"" (Spotify being my default music player in the alexa app). The echo dot would repeat my command but would NOT PLAY ANYTHING. Also I would open the Spotify app and try to look for the device there but it only finds my bathroom speaker, the Google Home Mini. Luckily I got it on sale for 5 bucks on Amazon so now I have a pretty chunky paper weight. ZERO STARS IF I CAN!!!! GRRRRR I'M MAD,GRRRR!!!!"	1	August 14, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I love my second generation Alexa, so I bought this for my parent's house as a convenience for turning on/off lights, setting quick alarms, and playing music. My parents are Asian, and have somewhat an accent, although we've been citizens for more than 20 years. They're able to speak English fine, yet it's funny to hear them yelling across the room multiple times before Alexa recognizes that we're talking to her. It's frustrating to them though. But the Amazaon Alexa App is easy to set up on their phone, and is easy for older adults to use.	3	July 26, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have both the google home ($80 when purchased) and this dot (a gift).Pros:Hard buttons are great.Music and radio playback is more intuitive.iOS app is more reliable.Hears commands better.Cons:Blinks often and does so at odd intervals making me a bit paranoid.Does not understand complex questions and does not answer them well. In other words, hears better but listens worse.Tbh, have not used it as much (my kids do) as the google home so I may be able to figure it out better, maybe alleviating the paranoid bit, but not as good at answering random questions.But if that‚Äôs not what you want to use it for, pretty great.	3	January 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt like how it‚Äôs always listening and half the time it responds even if you don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs name can be in the middle of talking to someone then bam there is goes, then I looked at my network monitoring and no way!!!

Echo Dot	It looks like that Alexa Echo Dot and all echo devices are not compatible with most Bluetooth devices / software. It has its exclusivity. It is sad but true according to their service agent. It does not work / connect easily with other bluetooth devices. The cheaper versions of speaker can connect / compatible mostly to all devices as long as it has bluetooth connectivity. What is worst is even you use it directly using the aux cable is the same. It cannot connect. Poor engineering ingenuity. Frustating.‚Äîrecommend to Buy JBL or other speakers if Speaker is your purpose.	3	June 24, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Alexa is a great device with a high quality speaker and good voice recognition. However, I personally got this to turn on the television without the remote... Alexa always says it is not connected to the hub or that the hub is not responding. I checked online for all the available solutions and nobody can solve for most of the people with this problem. I wish someday this would be fixed.Other than that annoying bug, the device is 4.5 stars. Loses another 1/2 star for the ridiculous paid content that sometimes pops for music or other such things. It activated memberships very easily and I had to then track that down and cancel it.	3	February 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Extremely disappointed my main reason was to listen to music and that is it a huge disappointment because you can‚Äôt even download anything.  I got a hold of customer service and they just transferred me to Technical Support. They told me someone will be calling me back. They wanted money for me to start out at first but almost $200 and then they went down to $75 and they told me if I didn‚Äôt give him the money and within five minutes my product will be shut down  they wanted money for me to start it out at first but almost $200 and then they went down to $75 and they told me if I didn‚Äôt give them the money and within five minutes my product will be shut down.  So in other words I was being scammed.  I have never been so pissed off or frustrated in my life for buying a product.  Everything that it‚Äôs doing for me I could do it with my iPhone iPod it so I can listen to music and I can‚Äôt even listen to music and I can‚Äôt even download it on my computer which I‚Äôve been trying to do for days so it‚Äôs been a total waste of money	2	August 27, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I'm a truck driver and I only got this to connect it to Apple Music so I can have a way to play music while on the road and not have to fiddle with my phone to turn it on/off and skip songs etc. It arrived while I was away from home and by the time I got back the return window closed. This is glitching and isn't connecting to Apple Music. It says I need a subscription to connect to Apple Music. I do have a subscription but it's still not letting me connect because it thinks I don't. I have no other use for this thing and now cannot return it.	1	May 17, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I love my Alexa but can we talk about the free bulb for a minute; it was the most stressful thing and then only after trying different light fixtures, restarting the bulb, downloading different apps and merging accounts did I come up the the conclusion (not even a definite answer because it says nowhere) that I needed a totally different device then Alexa to make it work. Yes the bulb was free but I was HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED in the lack of advertising on this.	3	November 2, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have one problem with echo dot that is sound quality. If volume is turned up to midway the sound becomes distorted. But, if set low or for immediate area the quality is passable. I would not recommend.	3	July 5, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It took well over 10 hours on four separate occasions to get Echo Dot connected.  Three hours +  each from 4 separate Amazon techs who couldn't make it connect and work.  Fourth try was a winner.  It's now working all right.  Incredible effort be people who who didn't know what they were doing .  Nice people though.  They kept their patience,  A lot more than I could say for myself.	3	December 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Have two of the gen 3 set up as a stereo set.  They work pretty good by themselves and as speakers for my fire tv 4k.  And unlike the new gen 4 they fit on my shelf.I just got two more of the Gen 3 Echo Dots.  Now I have them as two separate stereo groups and as music everywhere.Seriously a speaker this small should not sound this good!Took a copy couple stars off as multi room music is buggy and rarely works right.	3	August 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	After having a few echo show 5s , I don't know what to do with it it. I'm sure they work great. I did buy a few as gifts for family for Christmas while they had a great sale on them.  Even to use them as a speaker would be awesome. Bought to try using it to activate firestick for mom for Christmas. She has difficulty with tv and changing inputs to get firestick active. I know the show 5 works turning it on.	3	October 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I purchased it for my four year old.  It keeps asking if the little one wants to subscribe to this or that or do you want to buy this or that.  If they say yes,  it will purchase the item for you and charge to your account (must turn off the option if you have little ones at home).  It picks up anyone‚Äôs voice as long as they say Alexa even if you did not set it up.	3	November 15, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I'm somewhat impressed by what it can can do. Good price too. I wasn't satisfied with the music quality audio (classic orchestral). Inadequate instructions, for me, almost nothing in the box and I found it clumsy online (me, I suppose). We have no Smart Home items going yet, and we don't do podcasts yet. Probably could be a nice alarm system, or the beginning of one.  We're returned ours.	3	February 2, 2021	1
Echo Dot	You cant play your mp3's or any of your own music files on this device without using Bluetooth and pairing a device. It also seems to be lacking a few things like a stopwatch or allowing you to use your own alarm sound files. When your internet goes out it becomes fairly useless. It cant give you the time or do simple math but I think alarms still carry over I,m not certain. It is worth getting on sale for $25 sound quality is decent and the features it does have are  pretty nice.	3	July 25, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"I'm sure there was some fine print about this during the purchase but I certainly didn't notice it nor do many others I would imagine. I just discovered that Amazon started an Amazon Music subscription on my account without my explicit knowledge or authorization. Happily, I stumbled on this in my account before the free trial period expired and they actually charged me money. Such a ""scammy"" way of doing business in my opinion. I assume this happens whatever alexa device you purchase.Audio quality is fine for my purposes but I wouldn't want to listen to music on this speaker.Alexa integration with my philips hue lights works well about 80% of the time.Alexa can ramble on for way too long in response to many questions. Additionally, sometimes won't shut up even when you tell her to."	2	March 24, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Having Echo Dot without smart devices is like just having Alexa on your kindle: You don't need to have the dot f you have her on your Kindle. You can ask her to wake you up, remind you of an appointment, but you can't ask her to turn on your lights. I know this should be a given(So I'm not the brightest). Nevertheless, I got it because a friend said that Alexa is amazing. And she is, but she works the same on my Kindle. I don't need another Alexa unless I have smart devices.	3	July 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Sound quality is good for such a small speaker, HOWEVER:1) It forbids you from listening to Amazon Music on more than 1 speaker at a time. We cannot listen to the Echo upstairs and the one downstairs at the same time *unless* one is streaming Amazon and the other is streaming Spotify or Pandora. WHY DOES AMAZON THINK THEY WOULD LOSE MONEY IF THIS (allowing Amazon Music on multiple speakers at once) WAS A FEATURE!?2) It does not allow you to link Echos to each other to use as a pair of speakers - ONLY streams music through one OR the other, NOT both at the same time. If I'm wrong (hope I am!), then PLEASE reply to this review to explain how it works.3) Does not link to ANY bluetooth speaker to play music as a pair of speakers - JUST from the Echo or JUST from the other bluetooth speaker, NOT both.Finally, you're correct - I overused capital letters to convey my level of frustration and dissatisfaction with Echo speakers. I have and will continue to DIScourage friends from buying them for multi-speaker setups.	2	January 19, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"My Alexa doesn't have any problems, except when the wifi it first connected to goes down.  I tried connecting to another wifi source, but I can't find the settings in the Alexa app.  I go to either ""Echo & Alexa"" or ""All Devices,"" and select my echo dot, but there wasn't a setting for wifi like everyone says to do on YouTube and Google.

Echo Dot	Voice recognition and sound quality is fine, but it's doesn't connect well with Echo show (trying to play music on both devices simultaneously). It'll either not work at all or sporadically cut out on one or both devices	3	July 2, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I bought the Echo Dot in order to play music from Amazon Unlimited into me bedroom. Since the day it arrived integration with the Alexa App on my smart phone was spotty at best. Please understand I prefer to select my music from the app as opposed to trying voice commands. In the end the app told me that my device (echo Dot) was not recognized from the app while in Amazon Unlimited. I made the mistake of try to get help from Amazon support. What I got was an outsourced call center where English is obviously a second (or third)  language for the agent. While they may speak the language they do not comprehend. After several attempts to convey my problems with the app and the agent would stick to script and try steer me to the voice command where I was not having a problem. After a couple of minutes of this I hung up before I said something she would regret. As of now the Dot is sitting in a closet gathering dust and the money I spent is chalked up to the price of a lesson learned.	2	January 25, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I cannot get this dot to do anything that I want.  I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing something wrong I have other dots I have other Alexa products that I connected perfectly. I can‚Äôt even get this  dot to tell me the time don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with it but I‚Äôm very disappointed I did buy it as a gift for my sister to have in her room when she comes over and it‚Äôs just sitting there. I‚Äôm a little sad All it does is say that it cannot complete the task or that its doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying I don‚Äôt know	3	April 19, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Technically has certainly taken over our homes!She listens just as good as my teenagers do. When she finally ‚Äúwants‚Äù after yelling her name 50 times, she has such an attitude. But I‚Äôll admit, I have called her a few names that I won‚Äôt mention.Now if I can figure out how to fold and put away laundry and sweep, she can stay. As for now, she annoys me.	3	February 1, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I have two Google speaker, but never had a echo dot from Amazon. This echo dot is nothing to compare with the Google speakers in terms of sound quality. It's very foggy, when you play music on it, it's like all the singers singing with their mouths covered.	1	September 19, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"It will start to try to sell me, book suggestions, without any provocation, and other suggestions on selling me things.  This is an intrusion in my home. I‚Äôm getting rid of this and getting Google nest or some other alternative that doesn‚Äôt talk when I don‚Äôt want it to.  There‚Äôs no way to turn this off in the settings.  It‚Äôs really scary that Amazon feels it has a right to force this on us.  Amazon, seriously, you should let us turn of the ""By the way"" suggestions.....Update:  Also I do not appreciate Echo saying things like ‚Äúclouds are soft‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs a perfect day to play in the leaves‚Äù when asking what the weather is.  Note to self: find alternative to using Alexa to avoid unsolicited remarks.  From now on I‚Äôll ask Siri."	1	March 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	My echo was great for the first 3 months. After that, it stopped turning on. It would do the loading circle as usual, but then it would turn red and Alexa would say ‚Äòsorry, im having trouble understanding  right now‚Äô. Pretty frustrating that I had to spend $40 on an echo that only worked for three months	3	May 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"We have a zillion of these echo Dots. I even have one in my shop. ""Alexa, what is 3/32's of an inch in millimetres?"" while I work with my laser cutter, 3d printer, table saw, etc. ""Alexa, set a timer for 45 minutes"" in the kitchen. Why one star?""By The Way...""Every. Single. Time.  You try to do ANYTHING it responds with ""By The Way, I can BLAH BLAH BLAH"" There is NO WAY TO TURN THIS OFF! Now, ""Alexa, what is 3/32's of an inch in millimetres?"" ""0.09375 inches is equivalent to 2.38125 millimetres"" or ""Alexa, set a timer for 45 minutes"" ""Ok!"" You get a ""By the way, you can configure the upstairs group to set up automatic timers for blah blah blah blah"" or ""By the way, you can also control devices through blah blah blah"" when asking for a unit conversion!This happens. Every. Single. Time.There is. NO. WAY. TO. TURN. THIS. OFF!!!"	1	January 24, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I like the voice recognition and the Alexa integration.  I do not like the complicated set up process for the echo dot.  Currently, I am not receiving all of the echo dot benefits because I am not techno saavy.	3	June 25, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I got this as an extra it came with the Ring Door Bell. It goes off and says things with out you saying her name. It‚Äôs happen 3 times and says things that have nothing to do with what my daughter and I were talking about which makes me think it‚Äôs trying listen without sounding like it is. I know I sound crazy but I have to say it‚Äôs weird.  It plays really well and sounds great. I do love that you can pull radio stations from outside your state.	3	August 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This new Echo that I got sounds a bit better than my other one, but it already had an issue where it wouldn't play the music I wanted Alexa to play. No music would play at all, even from Amazon. So, I had to troubleshoot and unplug it for a few minutes and then plug back in... and then I got it to work again properly. I only just hooked it up recently and do not understand why there was a problem with it already. : (	3	September 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This is my second echo dot.  First one stopped working and couldn't get it to reset.  I hope this one lasts longer.  Can't give it a higher rating until I've had it longer.	3	July 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Barely can answer any question (Google is better). Can't find previous music that was played before. Confuses my playlists with other public playlists. It's good for playing the music though and it's good for using with the Wall Plug for my lights. Good with alarms and some reminders.  Update!!!!! It died between 16 and 17 months after purchase! Just thought I would share that!	2	December 18, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"Disappointed with the Gen. 3 Echo Dot, this is my second device and my Gen. 2 device is much better. Integration went smoothly and the sound is fine. Disappointment comes from the device not recognizing the wake word ""Alexa"" and having to repeat the phrase ""Alexa, along with the requested action. It may take 2 or 3 requests before the device wakes up. Not sure about trying any more Echo Dots quality is going downhill."	3	December 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is not even as smart as Siri. She always cannot understand me. The interaction is not fun with her...	3	August 31, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Works well, no real complaints other than I rarely use it.  Bought them on a Black Friday sale (2 ea) for a good price.  Set up was easy, lots of features, using to effortlessly control a bedroom lamp and the music playing is great, if you pay for a subscription to Amazon Music.  Absent that, the music quality is still good but you can‚Äôt ask for specific songs.	3	January 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"Rather than discuss on the Alexa Echo in general, I want to focus on a significant limitation of the system. As scheduling is a big ""feature"" of Alexa, the fact is Alexa devices can only handle calendars from Google, Microsoft, and Apple. If you are not using Gmail, Outlook, or iCloud, then you will not be able to have any Echo device keep you informed about your appointments. There is simply no support for the Yahoo, AT&T, or even the global standard of CalDAV. Alexa can not even access these calendar programs in read-only form, let alone add events to them. Additionally, there are no Alexa Skills or 3rd party apps that enable this ability, so there is no work-around this significant limitation."	3	November 13, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt know if it is all in my head but I think echo dot is getting a lot less sensitive to my voice lately. This is my second echo dot; I put it on the TV desk in the living room and the old one in my bedroom hoping that I won‚Äôt need to say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù loudly in my bedroom to control the lights in the living room any more. However, the 2 echo dot both fail to respond to the wake words from time to time. My old one is already not responding well when I purchased the new one. I thought it was because of humidity issue or something but I turned out to be not the case.	3	November 28, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Voice recognition works for questions but more often than not it would tell me to check my Alexa app because it didn't know the answer. I mainly want to use the dot for music but it's much harder to control than a normal Bluetooth speaker because you can't control it with your phone. And why are these not wireless yet?	2	January 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Everything was great the first week, I now can‚Äôt play something without it disconnecting from wifi	3	September 19, 2021	1
Echo Dot	TLDR; Just get a google nest, this product is not nearly as useful.Not a very good product at all, got offered a free one and figured I'd just use it as a Bluetooth speaker for my computer, did not realize this would be a hassle. First it wouldn't let me set it up fully until I did some searching to find a manual setup option (it's not shown or offered during setup) then why I finally got it set up I realized that navigating the app is a chore to get to any settings. Eventually I got sick of the shotty Bluetooth connection and tried to use an auxiliary cable, well to play through aux you need to select it in the settings, that setting is nowhere to be found. Just get a Google nest, it will serve you so much better than this will, it took me about 1 minute to setup my nest and about 30 seconds to start using it flawlessly.	1	January 7, 2022	0
Echo Dot	bought 5 of these 3 broke  so not sure	3	October 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This dot came with the purchase of a Fire TV from Best Buy or I would be sending it back.  It seems to interact with the Alexa system I have just fine (2 other Dots, 1st & 2nd Gen., and a Show)  I was glad to get this one for my bathroom because I enjoy listening to podcasts and NPR in the shower.  Neither of those function well with this Dot.  The radio will just stop after a few minutes.  The podcasts will stop in the middle of a show and go to another episode -- and that's only if I'm not already told that it can't bring up ANY podcasts.  The sound is also pretty bad.  Too bassy to understand the words half the time.  Yes, I have adjusted it on the Alexa app and turned the bass all the way down and the treble all the way up.  No help.	1	January 25, 2022	0
Echo Dot	In my opinion, the new 'dot' falls short on two fronts: 1) the original dot used USB type power adapter and cables. This allowed you to use longer or shorter cables and USB power hubs to great advantage. Now, it's a wall wat with a long cord and a barrel connection. A step back I think. Not great. And, 2) The audio was supposed to be improved... but it is more muffled and overall just not as solid.  It gets batter the louder you set the volume, but that is 't always the right effect. even with the audio controls built-in, the setting s are weak.  The Gen 2 is a better all-around unit.	3	December 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I bought it for $30 because I thought I could use it as another speaker to use with my Apple music. I have a portable Bose speaker. I wanted stereo sound from 2 speakers. Does not coordinate with another Blue tooth device. If I want to listen to Amazon Music I have prime. Not paying for extra stuff. Really not sure what to do with it . I asked it about the weather and Alexa got it wrong and I got drenched. In the closet until I decide what to do with it.	3	July 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have had the Echo‚Äôs for years and use them to get the weather, as an alarm\timer, controlling all the conveniences of my smart home. It really is cool if you like technology and the ease at which you can make something happen. But some overeducated and overpaid marketing genius at Amazon thought invading your home with marketing material is something that you will like.Me = ‚ÄúAlexa, what is the current weather‚ÄùAlexa = ‚ÄúThe current temperature is 80 degrees. By the way, I want to annoy you with 30 secs of irrelevant features and tell you how you can add things you don‚Äôt want to your Amazon cart because we only care about our shareholders.Any attempt at disabling this annoying feature (none exist) will result in us increasing the frequency of them. So, if you don‚Äôt mind constantly being harassed in YOUR own home by a company that cares more able blasting billionaires into space than your personal space, buy this product.I bought them to do my bidding, not for me to do yours.	1	November 21, 2021	0
Echo Dot	For it to be an upgrade from my original echo  dot, the sound quality on this one in comparison is really a let down. No matter what surface or surroundings I‚Äôve placed it in, it sounds muffled and speakers kind of sound like they‚Äôre blown. The power cord has changed too and not as easily interchangeable. Other than those two, I have no complaints about it. I love my echo devices around my home. They help me daily.	3	October 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have a number of Echos and Echo Dots, new and old. I have only one 3rd generation Echo dot. This thing has NEVER worked right from day one. It keeps dropping the network. I have moved it all over the house. It sits literally next to a first generation dot that works flawlessly right next to the router and it still drops the network every other week. This morning it stopped seeing the network altogether. I spent 5 hour plugging replugging, rebooting, resetting and it simply won‚Äôt see the network at all now. I called Amazon and after chatting with two of their people for 45 minutes telling me to do everything I had already done, the had me call and talk to two other people on the phone who told me to do the same things again. So about 6 hours of my time was spent on this. Finally I told the guy look are you going to send me a replacement or shall I just throw this in the garbage and he said it is a few days past the warranty period. Lol. I don‚Äôt think I have ever sent anything back to Amazon but this was a real let down. They have totally failed me. Shame on you Amazon. Bottom line don‚Äôt buy this generation of DOT. It is rubbish and Amazon won‚Äôt truly stand behind it.	1	September 23, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I got the Echo Dot 3rd Generation as part of an Amazon Music promotion to upgrade my Echo Dot 2nd Generation. I assumed that the size upgrade included a much better speaker as it looks a lot like a Google Home Mini which as a very good speaker and microphone. This Echo Dot sure is louder than the previous generations but it doesn't sound anywhere near as good as a Google Home Mini, it sounds very tinny when listening to music. The microphone also doesn't pick up very well at all. I have to say the same thing usually twice before it even recognizes me talking. Other than that though it is pretty good. I like how it looks.	3	December 3, 2019	1
Echo Dot	When I purchased this online I understood the ad to say that I would gettwo echo dots for $39.99 as a special offer for being a member of AmazonPrime and that a code would be applied at checkout.I was surprised and confused when my package came with just one echo dot.I re-checked my invoice and I received what it said. However, I was unable tofind the scrolling advertisement that pictured two echo dots. It was gone.	3	October 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I own one of the original Echo Dots and have always been happy with it.  Much more so than the Google Home Mini that I finally donated to Goodwill.  The newer Echo Dot was a real disappointment.  From my perspective, it functions well but the voice quality is not as good as on my original Echo Dot.  I found a number of other complaints about the same issue.	3	December 26, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I perched Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa, and set it up as directed and it worked 5 or 6 times, and then would not respond, and called tec support with no help, and the only way to use it is to keep re installing it for the same problem  very disappointed I had to change my review as Amazon sent me a replacement, and still had a few issues, but one tec finally figured it out the problem , and now I use Echo as a wake word, but still need instructions to tell what it can all do for me instead of guessing	3	February 15, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Sound is an improvement from last gen. Not a replacement for real speakers by any means, but if you‚Äôre not a audiophile then it‚Äôs tolerable. If you want real sound, I‚Äôd suggest Sonos. It integrates  with Alexa very well.Voice is louder than last gen as well.Was able to integrate with last gen and system without issue. App functions as well, although it (app) could use improvementI do have to repeat myself sometimes or raise voice if there are other noises in room.It doesn‚Äôt separate your voice from surrounding noises well.For $25-$30 I‚Äôm not disappointed. If you‚Äôre paying $50 I‚Äôd wait for a sale.	3	January 4, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"This was a Christmas gift, as my household really doesn't need an AI assistance, but I thought ""what harm could it do?""  I set up a morning routine to help me start the day, built a blueprint to make decisions for me, and even set up a skill to teach me a new language before a trip!  But none of that matters because the device stops working after a few minutes. I'm not sure as to why. Is it the device? Is it the network? Is it the skill?  It's okay when it runs, but it doesn't run as well as everyone says it does.  At least for me."	3	January 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I like the echo dot however l wish l could use the app here in the Bahamas because it's not allowing me to download  it because of my jurisdiction. The Bahamas being a supporter of Amazon l believe we should have been able to use the app. So l am unable to benefit from all the features of the echo dot. If l knew before han that l would not be able to download and use the Alexa  app on my phone, l most likely would not have purchased the echo dot.	3	June 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Siri is far better for my needs. I do understand why Alexia is very popular, though.The little hockey puck is cute and lovable, but, and I just had my hearing tested, it has a lack of 4Khz to 10Khz, which is in the sibilance frequency range. With Siri, I need no annoying hockey puck with a wall wart and wire to be pulled and cause trouble, if you can imagine.For some reason, I was offered the little thing for only $0.99, during a promotion. That would explain my purchase. Signing up for the ""Alexia"" service, on my part, was a big mistake. I'll rectify that error in judgement."	1	May 8, 2022	0

Echo Dot	The speaker on her is not the best. I think mine may have been faulty because I've heard other dots before and they sound better than mine. Also when you ask her to add something to your playlist where your favorites list she tells you that you have never created when would you like to create one now you say yes 10 minutes later try to add something to your favorites list again she tells you you still haven't created one. Also the. Does not connect well to the app in my experience she doesn't follow routines  consistently from the app for some reason.	3	March 13, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I bought this Echo Dot with the intention of using it as an alarm clock in the bedroom.  I was all excited to use my Spotify playlists as an alarm.  I have tried at least 20 times to set an alarm using my Spotify playlists, but it hasn't worked- not even once.  It shows the alarm on the Alexa app, but never plays.  Just to see if it would work, I tried the same thing on my Google Home, and it worked on the first try.  To add to the problems, I recently had to reset my internet and the Echo Dot couldn't reestablish a connection.  So, if the home internet ever cuts out in the middle of the night, the alarm won't work.  So, if you are the type of person that is OCD about checking to see if your alarm is turned on (like I am), now you'll spend all night wondering if the alarm is going to work in the morning.  I really don't think that I am expecting too much from my Echo Dot, but it still failed to meet those low expectations.	2	November 16, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Ok, it‚Äôs like this. This is our second and It struggles to keep up. It ignores commands. It plays whatever it wants too. And the other morning when I was getting cursed out very harshly for oversleeping. My very christian in-laws were woken up by their Fire TV 30 miles away. I set up their TV for them months ago I guess I never logged out of my account. We got a nice phone call at 7 AM.	3	October 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	She responds to my friends even though they have no voice profile with her , could be a security issue . It continues to play acoustic and live versions of music although I continually request for only album versions . Oh and she said that there is one much more fair than me. !

Echo Dot	i like that i can play one at a time or more. and its easy to just ask for a station to play or set a timer, etc. But I  did get this so i could easily plug an aux cord into my laptop or phone and hear whatever i want in a wired up way. In particular my laptop. This is not so easy to do. it is NOT plug and play.  looking around to see how i can make this happen but i don't feel like it should be this hard. other than that i enjoy it	3	April 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I'm only writing this review so it stops nagging me every week, despite I didn't buy it off of Amazon, it was a gift. However! It's still quite useful amd handy to have.

Echo Dot	Not really wowed by the product. So far all I can get it to do is tell me a joke, time, weather, and notify me when the amazon packages arrive. Aside from that it‚Äôs ok.

Echo Dot	"The Echo Dot is a great device unless you want to use it for the purpose that I wanted to use it for. That is, arming my SimpliSafe security system automatically by establishing a schedule routine. The Echo Dot integrates with SimpliSafe, but only for voice commands to arm the security system. It is fine that you must disarm the system manually after Alexa arms it. I am able to create a routine to arm the system, however, I must be there in range of the Echo Dot to answer the Alexa follow-up to the action from the routine ""Do you want me to arm your SimpliSafe security system"", If I do not answer vocally with a ""Yes"" the action is not executed. Sometimes we forget to set our alarm when we go to bed at night. It would be nice if Alexa could cover for us when this occurs. Other than this issue, the Echo Dot I have found, is a fun and useful device."	1	January 7, 2022	0

Echo Dot	i was enjoying playing with it and found it pretty good. Then after installing some security cameras i come to find out only AT&T is the allowed carrier.

Echo Dot	Useless you have to manually use the app to control it, it doesn‚Äôt really do anything by itself. It‚Äôs point less, she doesn‚Äôt listen. You have to be very specific with what you say but say it the way she speaks or she won‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs always listening so I turned the microphone off but def a safety issue.

Its programmed to read only my voice but it recognizes my friends voices also. You also cant set it up to recognize multiple peoples voices (such as you and your partner) so each person has to have their own device. And lastly, its sound is terrible. With the volume all the way up, you can barely hear it 10 ft away from the device while your in the same room.	3	June 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I always ask Alexa what temperature it is outside. She helps me wear appropriate outfits every day. Also she plays my music when I ask her too or need her too.  I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have paid full price though cuz it went on sale like 2 weeks after I got it but it wouldn‚Äôt let me return it for some reason. Not worth more than $30	3	January 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I was so hopeful that the Echo Dot (3rd gen) would help me keep myself organized. Unfortunately it was used by my children to drive me up the wall to the point it was unplugged more than plugged in. I am selling it. I've been SOOOOOO disappointed by this. I'll stick with Siri.	2	January 16, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Did use it much but then decided to connect some dimmable light bulbs. After screwing around with the light bulbs for over an hour and finally getting them to connect, it was time to get the Dot to control the lights, only now the Dot won't connect. I've reset it a half dozen times, tried multiple networks and it's a no go. Won't do it, won't work, won't connect. What a joke.So I gently applied a sledge hammer to it....about 10 times. It still doesn't work, but I feel better.	1	June 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Speaker sounds ‚Äòmuffled‚Äô compared to Google Assistant.Int√©gration to Amazon Music is great.Play radio channelsAlexa loses her mind a lot and loses track of what she‚Äôs doing.  Very inconvenient	3	July 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Sound could be improved	3	October 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Works pretty well, integrates well.  But Alexa doesn't seem to know what 'leave the volume alone' means.  We have two, and both readjust their volumes at what appears to be random times, and the adjustment is always to relatively low levels.  It's possible to raise the volume and try a command again, but when you've adjusted the volume when going to bed so you'll hear the alarm, finding that it has at some point decided that you really didn't want the volume where you set it, is fairly distressing.	3	June 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I live this little gadgets do love it, but there are a few strange quarks. She‚Äôs not very understanding of everything you dictate regardless of perfect pronunciation. Second, when you change the command word from let‚Äôs say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù to ‚Äúecho‚Äù she switches back on her own to original command word. Third, there was a very annoying yellow ring that appeared and cause a ridiculous frequent beeping noise. There were no instructions anywhere on what it meant and I had to do extensive research to figure it out. All in all I do love my new friend and her silly jokes , I just hope they work these little kinks out eventually.	3	January 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have to stand near the speaker and repeat several times the instruction for smart speaker to acknowledge it. ZI got tired of it. In addition, I have ut for trial period, to make sure if it was that I need to use t it or speak louder and it will improve over time but it did not. Then, even when I returned within the time allowed, Amazon did not gave me the full return, that never happened to me. They kept $10.85 for the period of trying them. Like if they rent it to me, without warning. I am very glad I return them.	3	February 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Pretty good sound. Looks pretty nice on the bookshelf as well. Installation and setup was smooth. It's voice recognition isn't nearly as good as the full size Echo we have though. For example, it will mistake Halsey for Oldies, which never happens in the other Echo we have. Still a pretty good device. Just wish the microphone was a little better.	3	March 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	My wife got this for me as a present so I could listen to music in the bedroom. I have an echo dot in my office and I enjoy listening to music on it. I hooked the second one up to the app. It gives me information about deliveries but keeps saying I have to pay to listen to music. This does not make sense since they are on the same account. I have tried repeatedly to contact Amazon about it, but all I get is robo responses with clickables that do not address my problem.	2	September 20, 2021	0
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs OK. the sound quality marginal, definitely not as good as theAlexa  tower. I also didn‚Äôt realize you had to pay a monthly fee in order to play different music in different rooms.If you buy more than one you‚Äôll need a teenager to help set it up :-)	3	May 12, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I use it to listen to music. I'm disappointed I can't get my local country station on it though.	3	August 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"Getting it to sync up with or properly work with our older generation echo is a mess. Half of the time if we are in the living room it does not respond to voice commands or the commands end up being sent to the older model that is in the bedroom. For example asking ""Echo, play Christmas music"" usually gets ignored or the music will only play in our bedroom. Only surefire way of getting the livingroom one to sync up to the bedroom is to use the app on my phone. If I wanted to use my phone to play music through speakers I would have just gotten a bluetooth speaker."	3	December 24, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Upgraded from a Gen Echo Dot.  The sound quality of the Gen 3 is much improved over previous models.  That's about the only positive I have found.  Voice recognition sea about the same.  There is one big negative with this device.  The power cord now uses a proprietary plug for connecting the the device and the cord is only about 4 meters long.  Not quite long enough for placement where the previous echo dot was.  I see this as a hendrance and will be strongly considered when looking to upgrade my other devices. Amazon, you blew it with the power on this one.	3	January 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I ordered theses to add to my previous Echoes to have reminders sound everywhere I might be and so I could call someone from anywhere in case I needed help. They work okay except the sound is extremely mushy.	3	June 15, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The voice recognition with Pandora does not work. It is supposed to recognize stations but it does not, instead creating a new station based on some random piece of music, although I can play them from the Alexa app.According to various forums, this problem has been around for awhile but Amazon has not fixed it. Other than that this device is really good, but playing music was one of the most important things for me.	3	October 16, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Even though I've placed the device right next to our router and away from other electronics, the connection continuously gets lost.

Echo Dot	"I don't ask much of my Alexa, but she is seriously as dumb as a brick! For example, yesterday she randomly said something to me and, since the TV was on, I only heard ""music."" I asked her to repeat and she said there was nothing to repeat. One morning I asked her to play Olivia Newton-John (not for the first time, either) and she proudly played ""Angel"" by Sarah McLaughlin.  Oh well, at least I like that song!"	3	September 9, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Can't get it to work as advertised with other echo devices.	3	September 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I got the device and when it works I like it.  Problem is, it forgets all my devices every month and a half or so and I have to spend an hour or more fighting with it to reconnect everything again.  This last time it wouldn't reconnect and I had to contact Amazon who told me it was out of warranty after only 3 months, so it's mostly a paperweight.  At least I will know better in the future not to buy Amazon devices other than the Kindle.  Lesson learned.	1	June 6, 2022	0
Echo Dot	We have two dots. Side by side: 3rd gen did not know answers 4 out of 10 tries. Earlier model 10 out of 10.New model has proprietary electric hook up instead of readily available plug used on a gazillion  androids.It has standard earphone port okay, that's  nice. Not a reason to purchase.So if you want a dot that graduated last in class and constantly wants to play games, but don't want children. Then here's your alternative.	3	August 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I generally enjoy this device, as well as other Amazon electronics. But my Lord, trying to turn off the explicit filter to get the DOT to play vaguely explicit content from HULU is just awful. I am to the point where I have given up and am going to sell these stupid things off and try a different product.Seriously Amazon, you are better than this. I have been an avid customer for a very long time but this shouldn't be so difficult that I have to have my laptop, plus my phone, complex passwords, multi-tier levels of logging in just to change a simple setting that after having done all of the above still does not work.	2	July 20, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The Dot stopped working right outside the warranty period. It refused to sync to my network. When I sought support from Amazon, their staff was extremely rude. One suggested I download the Windows version of Safari from a third-party file-sharing site riddled with popups called FileHippo. I was flabbergasted - Amazon's official support potentially getting my PC infected with a virus. Another agent offered $6 against my next purchase of Echo. Suffice to say I am not giving another penny to this company for their awful devices that hey intentionally break (Like the full FireTV devices they intentionally bloat to slow down to crawl in a couple of years). No more Amazon devices and definitely no more Echo for me.	1	April 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Shame on Amazon for providing 90 day warranty when this device breaks and have to be trashed within a year. This is my second one in two years stopped working and nothing can support do. You should provide a free replacement no matter how old. Never buying echo again!!! When I called support they had the audacity to offer 15% off next purchase!!! Wow that is horrible!	1	August 19, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"We own 6 Alexa devices of various generations.  We bought the first generation when it came out years ago.  Alexa's voice recognition was terrific five years ago.  It seems that it gets worse every month now.  This has been going on for a couple of years.  I have complained to AMZ but they seem more interested in new features than making the thing work well.  Here's the latest example:  I set up our new Roomba vac to Alexa.  As with all integrations that I have tried, it just doesn't work well.  Here's how it went:  Alexa turn on Roomba.  Perfect, Roomba started.  Next ""Alexa pause Roomba"".  She says ""you can integrate Roomba with the ap...."".  This goes back and forth about 10 times.  Alexa follows my command 3 out of 10.  3 times she does what I ask. The other 7 she tells me to integrate.  We will buy the Chrome device next time.  Alexa's great start and plummet reminds me when we also did business with Sears and Mongomery Ward growing up.  Same pattern...success the complacency."	1	June 25, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Promotion for Amazon music is nervy	3	October 7, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Alexa will ping as if it is listening when no one has said anything remotely close to ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù. It will follow up with unwanted information such as additional features, continuing on for 30 seconds with additional (unrelated information) after a simple request.Worst as of yet I just asked Alexa if scones need to be refrigerated and was instead met with a lengthy AD for a sale on LG refrigerators. When asked the same question again I was met with a concise answer. Done waste my time with information that I did not request. I am close to ready to remove this device from my home. Use to be good.  Has become worse with Amazon greed over time.	1	April 10, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I got this echo dot and a new echo voice remote on sale to supplement my first generation echo. The feature I love the most on my first generation echo is being able to control it via the voice remote when the echo microphone is disabled via the red button on the top.  I was looking forward to doing the same with my new echo dot and was very disappointed to find out the hard way that voice control via the remote will not work UNLESS the microphone on the echo dot is enabled which defeats the purpose.I contacted support via chat thinking that I may be doing something wrong, but they were not able to help me.  It looks as if the behavior is by design, or by design flaw.  If disabling the echo dot microphone also disables echo voice remote commands, then what is the point of pairing up an echo voice remote with an echo dot?I hope this is something that can be fixed remotely, otherwise I have limited use for this device, and little incentive to recommend it.	2	December 5, 2019	0
Echo Dot	AI is a myth! Asking simple tasks is it‚Äôs forte! It does not learn anything you tell it, it shuts off at will and hooking it up to other devices is a special torture! But for cost and simple functions it is great! Do not over estimate it‚Äôs abilities!	3	April 25, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I've had a few echo dots around the house for a while now. Never had issues with them, I mostly use them for music around the house, but something new happened today. My dot made an alert noise and started blinking yellow. This was new to me, I took time out of a busy work day to figure out what was going on. Figured out it probably meant I had some kind of alert, so I started talking to it to figure out what was going on. It confirmed I had a notification, so I asked it to read it to me. It was an advertisement, trying to get me to re-order something I ordered a week ago. Are you kidding me Amazon? An advertisement? If I didn't ask for this, keep it the **** out of my house. I checked my account, I don't have reorder notifications turned on. It took a chat with support to direct me 4 layers deep in the app menu where I could opt out. I didn't drop $150 on speakers just to have them advertise to me within my own home. What a garbage move.UPDATE: Now, the speaker has started asking me to review/rate products out of the blue. Never happened before, had to dig around in app settings to figure out how to turn that off as well. What bone-headed product manager thinks this is a good direction for the product?	1	June 15, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Nothing bad to say about it.	3	October 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	For the size, it is definitely loud enough. Works great as an alarm, and is sensitive enough to hear its name quietly across the room.My main problem is not with the dot, but with alexa herself. It needs work, the amount of times she just can't answer a question or directs me to do something on a different device is annoying. I'm sure it will improve over time, but from my experience she really needs some more work.	3	September 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"As I said ours quit working in less than a month so now I have to control all our smart devices via my cell phone's Alexa app.  I have tried factory resetting three times and done everything I can up to this point and all Alexa says through the Dot is "" I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. "" By the way, I have a background in I.T. and still do I.T. work on the side, with A+, Net +, Microsoft Certified Professional and back in my day it was Server 2008 experience, so it's not as if I do not know how to set up the device and reset the device when it's not working properly.  It worked like a dream at first and the sound quality was fantastic.  Speech recognition is great as long as it is me talking to the device and not my wife.  It struggles to understand her at times.  Not saying it's a horrible product.  There just must be some problem with this one."	2	March 8, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I tried to use these in a surround sound setting with our fire stick, and the set up kept freezing. I was instructed to unplug the fire stick for 3-5 minutes to reset the cache. It played video for about 20 minutes before freezing my fire stick.

Echo Dot	I get more of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know that‚Äù from it than anything else for simple to look up info. It can‚Äôt even play music right. It just wants you to say play rock or rap etc. I had to go back to Bluetooth speaker because it‚Äôs so worthless.I find myself cussing this device out in utter frustration way too often. I guess it‚Äôs good to tell you the time.Volume is either super loud or just too low.  And you have to be pretty close to it for it to hear you. It must be plugged in to work so it‚Äôs not portable, isn‚Äôt that the idea of getting such a small device is that you can move it around??	2	May 28, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Can‚Äôt work without being plugged in//Difficulty following specific instructions	3	September 17, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Set up was rather easy, however I'm very disappointed with the quality of the audio. It's extremely muffled as if it were being held under a thick pillow. I've tried the normal suggestions found on the web, basically doing a power cycle adjusting the equalizer controls and of course checking for updates, but none of those have helped. I had planned on setting this up in my office for some background music but it's more suited for generating white noise.  As for integration. Most of my lights are automated and configured for voice control. For some reason Alexa does not like my kitchen lights. Half the time I ask for them to be turned on I'm told that there are multiple devices with the same name and instructs me to delete and add them again. There is only one Kitchen Light, and nothing else in the house that sounds even close to them. I have the same problem with Alexa on my Facebook Portal mini (Gen-1). However; this has always worked flawlessly on all of my Google Home Minis (Gen-1), which also have excellent audio.	2	December 6, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Had to return my first one cause it continually froze up until finally it just quit working altogether. In the 2 months I owned the first one I had to do a hard reset probably 6 or 7 times. I read online that this is a common problem and many say it is most likely attributed to the supplied electrical cord.Once I got the new one it works well and have had no problems. Thankfully I don't use it very much anyway though. Mostly music, lol. It understands well and has good sound quality for where I keep it in my bedroom.	3	February 19, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I received my new Echo Dot (ordered on Prime Day 2019). It was delayed in delivery due to the high volume of purchasers on Prime Day. However, this Echo Dot has the worst sound quality of any of my dots I've purchased. (I have 5 of them throughout my house and garage. I don't know if they rush ordered these from China and bypassed the quality control or if they made them cheaply to offer at the 1/2 price discount for Prime Day...but I'm totally disappointed. I'd return it, except then I'd have to pay full price (and I already turned in my better performing 2nd Gen Echo Dot for the trade-in discount). Buyers beware - you get what you pay for! :(	3	September 3, 2019	1

Echo Dot	I enjoy having a fact check, info and musical library at my command. The down side is that the voice command does always respond to my resquest.  This is very frustrating, and lack of response creates a time laspe. I use the music and the JW. Org library for daily use.  When mini dot does respond i have to use my cell phone or hard copies. Music sound quality is very good.	3	October 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	As it comes to sound quality i wont say it is top notch; but yeah its decent enough. The voice recognition and connectivity is great though. Design wise as its pretty nice. However it has to be kept on a flat surface for proper sound (which should not be a problem for most of us really) but yeah initially i didnt have a table and i used to keep it directly on the carpet, the sound didnt used to come properly.	3	August 12, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I realize that sounds odd, but what we're finding with this new generation is that the sound of the timers or reminders going off completely deafen her from hearing you tell her to stop.

Echo Dot	I just want a voice-activated device that can control lights, thermostats, etc.  I don‚Äôt want Alexa to be my pal, and especially when that pal is routinely offering advice about stuff I can get from Amazon.

Echo Dot	I only use this to play music. Doesn't recognize when I want certain playlists to play on Spotify and repeatedly played the same playlist that I didn't ask for. Worthless. Not useful for me until voice recognition gets better.Not to mention that it randomly makes noise and lights come on in the middle of the night. I tossed it in the trash.	1	August 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I was initially super impressed and excited. As I‚Äôve been using Alexa, trying to integrate it into the house, and use the app, I‚Äôve become less impressed. She is difficult to teach, has significant limitations, and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt pay full price. She interacts great with Amazon but doesn‚Äôt access things like Pandora, Nest, or Podcast very effectively. I couldn‚Äôt get some skills like National Weather Service to work at all with her. Overall, it‚Äôs an ok product. I‚Äôd imagine in 5-10 years these things will be great. Right now, for someone who doesn‚Äôt enjoy troubleshooting technology, it‚Äôs probably more trouble than it‚Äôs worth.	3	January 11, 2020	1

Echo Dot	When we first got the echo dot were excited at how loud it was. We would play music in the kitchen while cleaning or cooking. However only two months of having it, it is not loud anymore even though the volume is set to maximum. I can no longer hear music while water is running at the same time. Otherwise it was easy to set up and is portable. My kids still like it, just wish the sound was louder.	3	August 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It is not as easy as plugging it in and just work. Spent days , indeed weeks , it still won't open browsers,won't run my computer or turn it on or off.

It is not easy as it advertised, you have to download one thing after another then still don't do it.	3	August 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I've had my two second generation echo dots for about a year and they're fantastic.

It's in the exact same location that we used to have one of the older ones, so nothing has changed except the machine itself. In fact, sometimes we raise our voices and it still won't get it right, but one of the second generation dots answers us from another room. I got it as a deal, but I should have stuck with the second generation dots. BOO. HISS.	3	January 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The vice is a little softer to understand compared to my original dot.  Used mainly for lights, music and information.	3	August 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	can't get the volume high enough and I've tried everything.	3	September 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It works fine. Wish there was a way to turn off some of the light settings like for messages. Doesn't seem to matter if it's an email, text, or app message, the dot won't stop lighting up until I open every program that sent me a notification. It won't stop lighting up when I simply clear the notification bar. I unplugged the thing because of that.	3	December 2, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I purchased 5 of these devices to use 2 each on televisions as surround sound and 1 for my office. They have been nothing but a constant headache. I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS IF USE IS FOR HOME THEATER/ SURROUND SOUND. They constantly drop and disconnect the sound. Since purchase, several times weekly I have to go through the pain of trying to unlink and reconnect them to the selected Fire tv device. The sound is good when they are connected but as stated they disconnect several times weekly and are very difficult to reconnect. I've had two replaced that completely refused to reconnect after customer services tried every trick he could think of. Pay a little bit more and get a real home theater system and save yourself the headache of these. I really wanted these to work, because I am very much invested into the Amazon eco system; but I can not endorse these units for surround sound/ home theater. I've spent a lot of money on these units that are now, just in a box on a shelf.	1	October 11, 2021	0
Echo Dot	With kids it often plays music load and it is not designed to stand up to it. The volume should be limited so as not to blow the speaker out.	2	March 28, 2022	0
Echo Dot	We've had old alexas for years, but like everything else on Amazon, what once was a great product now really sucks. Today I had to beg the less than year old new Alexa to play ANYTHING for my babies nap, before pulling it off the cord and getting one of the 5+ year old Alexa's and having that work immediately (picture above). This new one, the one being sold here, is honestly trash. It won't play for more than 10 minutes without cutting out. It refuses to play from anything other than Amazon music. And it straight won't play. Today I begged it to play ANYTHING before it announced a random station we've never used then sat silently not playing.One good thing is if you can actually get the thing to play it does have better sound quality than the older ones.I would rather buy an old radio from a thrift store than ever buy another one of these products. I would rather pay 10 times the amount for the apple equivalent. At least both these options would work better than this Alexa echo.	1	August 6, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I bought it for .99 cents and it was a good purchase, however that‚Äôs all it was, not saying it‚Äôs bad but it‚Äôs not great either. I‚Äôm not going into a long rant about the features because I hate people that do, but I was cautious about buying it because it ‚ÄúALWAYS LISTENS TO YOUR CONVERSATION‚Äù like okay who cares... and even if it is true why would the government care about what you are going to eat or what show to watch. Either way You‚Äôll be safe and if you‚Äôre a drug dealer reading this, just unplug it. Problem solved. You‚Äôre welcome America.	3	January 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This product has lost its intelligence and recognition over time. It doesn‚Äôt respond right away and it‚Äôs a bummer. I have to think of what to say before because it doesn‚Äôt give me time to think so i can say what i want to ask. I‚Äôm disappointed :(	2	January 19, 2022	0
Echo Dot	This is the second Echo Dot I‚Äôve received where the port hole is so off center or the pin is bent (can‚Äôt really tell which it is). The second dot was to replace the first one that I couldnt plug into the power port. This time around I cant plug anything into auxiliary port because again the pin isnt centered in the port. When doing the first return as well as the second return I was guided to customer service and led to believe the item would be replaced only to answer a few extra questions and then be given only the option of a return. So I ordered my own replacement. That would be fine except the first one was $20. The second time around it was $25, now I see the price has gone up to $40. Not happy with these tactics.	1	February 1, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I don't like it that I'm got to have Wi-Fi to use the thing. Also the tone/base is too much for the small speaker. At times it is distorted.	3	July 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It took me quite a while and a few YouTube videos to figure out how to set up the item I bought it for.  Then I kept receiving emails from amazon telling me all of the things that Alexa could do but when I asked her how to set that up, she did not know.  The Echo still only does the function I bought it for but it does do that very well.	3	September 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Mainly use it to control lights and listen to Spotify. The latter is what it really fails at and I'm pretty sure it's by design since they operate a competing service. Spotify will stop playing randomly so often that I'll resort to another device more often than not. I've tried everything to get this piece of trash to cooperate with playing music off Spotify- of course you can't hook it up with Ethernet, but putting it right next to the access point should be good enough, but I guess not. Curiously, I've never had the issue when I was using Amazon music. I've had the 2nd Gen one, too and it was just as useless for Spotify. No other wireless device in my home will drop off in the middle of a song while using the service, except for these stupid plastic POS hockey pucks. If you just want something for streaming music to some speakers, I'd recommend getting something else and save yourself the frustration in dealing with these worthless 'smart' speakers.	2	March 11, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†This is a product you dont need you just want. After owning it for less than a year i regret buying it and i realized i never really needed it. The alexa app is very slow and not very user friendly. The speaker itself has decent sound. In the beginning i had no issues with voice recognition but now i feel i have to yell for alexa to hear my voice. The Bluetooth connection is the worst ive ever seen in my life. Even $5 speakers have a more reliable and stable bluetooth connection. The speaker is right by my computer and it still has issues. Finally the speaker itself has started to sound VERY static. No matter what i do it doesnt go away. Do not buy. Im sure you wont use the ""smart"" features as much as you think you will. Ive encountered all these issues and the speaker isnt even a year old."	2	June 29, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I wouldn't have bought it myself but it was a gift when switching my insurance. It talks about being able to connect to bluetooth devices but that's only if they are Amazon related. So if you're thinking that you can connect any of your bluetooth capable devices to it, like a music player or speaker (unless it's an additional Amazon speaker) you're going to be disappointed. The sound was decent but even at its loudest it's not very loud and the voice recognition is good.	3	June 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I love Alexa and the many possibilities it may posssess however at times I may call the key  phrase on a unit and Alexa lights up as to listen...then just shuts off.  Even when asked what time is it?  Sometimes I repeat the name Alexa and each time 5-6 it lights up and then shuts off no response.  I have reported this.  Can't really depend on ALEXA being there when you call.	3	August 23, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"It's all right and all but Amazon has to find a way to make it stop yelling the device connected to it. I have it connected to my MacBook Pro and I leave my computer on sleep when I don't use it. When I get a notification (text message or any phone notification) my MacBook pro wakes up for a sec and shows the notification, at that moment since Echo gets a signal from the MacBook yells ""Now Connected to Mac Book Pro!!!!"" with full-on max volume, it is so annoying. it wakes up everyone every time I get a notification on my phone! There is no way to turn that off either! I am about to trash it, to be honest..."	1	March 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	So frustrating when a product stops working and customer service has you continue to try something that doesn‚Äôt work. When setting up my Dot in a new home, it went into an ‚Äúupdating‚Äù error that disconnects the device from WiFi and makes it unusable. Customer service says they get tons of calls about this and the fix is to try setup again and again until it finally works. After 32 attempts, I gave up. How frustrating. Amazon should have recalled and replaced these devices when they knew of a fatal flaw. Instead, they choose to frustrate their customers and give no options other than buy another Dot. I will definitely start shopping and purchasing. Amazon products due to this terrible product.	1	March 18, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I have a 2nd generation echo dot with a USB power supply.  The new 3rd generation uses another type of power cable.  The cable itself is inferior quality (the kinks are probably there to stay), and there's no option to use a longer/shorter cable because unlike the USB style it's all one piece.  Also the base with the plug is too wide to fit into a standard power strip.  I'm not sure why Amazon made a change in the power cable, but this is a very poor design.	3	April 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	These things are driving me crazy! I am use to telling google or I heart to play a song and Bam Done! This thing I have to unplug daily and repeat myself several times. before it does what I ask. It will say playing I heart 90's (example) and nothing happens or just stops in the middle of a song like I asked it something and start lighting up but then does not play the song back after I do not answer. Also I set up 2 sep. and somehow they are now joined so when they want to listen to something upstairs it also plays downstairs (even though the app is still set up on 2 diff. Amazon accounts for each one). I dont know if I got defective ones ( or refurbished ) but I am not happy. It doesnt perform like others at my family/ friend homes.	2	September 1, 2020	0

Echo Dot	Compared to my other Alexa, I feel like this small one struggles a bit more than my regular Alexa.  It does integrate well with most of our stuff and it just picked up from our amazon account, but there are a few items that it cant connect to.  It is better than our google but still won't connect to everything.  We use IFTT for the other things so most things work with it.  I do think the speaker could have been better but for the size, the sound is good.	3	March 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I‚Äôm at my last nerve with these things. We have 6. Including echo shows. Every single one can‚Äôt hear. Even when you say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù no response a majority of the time, unless you scream. Or she says ‚Äúcan you repeat that‚Äù 90% of the time. I‚Äôll talke quietly to the one in my room and 98% (no exaggeration) of the time I have to repeat myself. Room isn‚Äôt loud, I talk at a normal quiet volume, nothing. This happens everyday and I‚Äôve had enough. Also, there‚Äôs no nightlight feature? You‚Äôll let the yellow ring glow for packages, but nothing for a simple night light? Good grief. Supposed to be so advanced and can‚Äôt even offer simple features.	1	March 30, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I love the features that the Echo Dot offers and do appreciate that it is compatible with my bed lights, room lights, and even Smart TV alongside the smart plugs I use but when I want to play music, it really doesn't have the best sound quality and I have to connect it to a Bluetooth speaker. Other than that, it is a great product but not one to get to listen to music on unless you have a speaker.	3	July 15, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt like that Alexa has no manners. I‚Äôve had Cortana and Siri and both of them, when I say thank you, replied with something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome ‚Äú or ‚Äúanytime ‚Äú . Alexa doesn‚Äôt reply to ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. also, when I ask her to read one of my kindle books to me, she often gets the wrong book or starts in the middle of the book, or only reads the reviews. When I play music, she doesn‚Äôt seem to understand ‚Äúturn it up‚Äù or ‚Äúturn it down ‚Äú.	3	April 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Today my first ever amazon official product came in the mail. I was excited because many of my friends own it and it has made their lives easier. No matter where I am, Alexa is always there to respond to tasks. My issue with Alexa, and I am guessing it might be the product I received, is that the plug doesn't stay on the wall for more than 10-20 minutes. I mean it slowly slips out, and it's very inconvenient because it doesnt stay plugged so Alexa doesn't work. Other than that everything Alexa does is fantastic, I would recommend getting bluetooth speakers because Alexa playing music at high volume doesn't sound very good.	3	October 3, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I expected Alexa to be smarter when asked a question, not so really she is very narrow minded.  A very big problem is Echo Dot (3rd Gen) will start talking without being commanded to.  This means Alexa is always listening but butts into a quiet room when not asked to.  I really hate the increasing commercials being broadcasted by Echo Dot (3rd Gen).  I think Echo Dot (3rd Gen) should only activate when asked to.	3	July 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"It only does about half the things it's supposed be able to do.  Playing all the music you purchased in Amazon's early days, when they really needed every customer they could get, is nearly impossible.  When you want to group the speakers in your house together, like for holiday gatherings it drops off speakers until none are playing, that is if it ever plays at all.  The twi things Alexa usually gets right is switch control and saying the word space when spelling words..... it often spells the wrong word but at least when it spells ""big car"" for my daughter instead of ""bigger,"" it places the word ""space"" between the ""g"" and the ""c.""  I wouldn't recommend an Alexa item to anyone that wasn't intending to voice control switches.  If you want intelligent answers get a Google."	2	October 12, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I just added a Echo Dot to my home now I have the echo dot in my bedroom and the Alexa plus in my living room. A lot of times the Echo Dot can hear me from the living room a little bit and gets things mixed up like turning the lights off or not knowing the lights are on. I can‚Äôt get the two of them to link up or somehow pair up in someway. I was wanting to get one for the kitchen to have all three play music or I can communicate wherever I‚Äôm at.

Echo Dot	"I have an Echo (2nd generation) and three Echo dots (Two 3rd generation, one 2nd generation). The primary reason I bought these was to play music throughout the house. I also have Amazon Music Unlimited.I often have the following problems:1. Music will play on one or two speakers, but not the others.2. Music will suddenly stop on its own - sometimes it starts again, sometimes it doesn't.3. The Echo doesn't play music after saying, ""Playing X by Y artist""4. The Echo blinks red and says ""I'm sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now.""5.

Echo Dot	Go figure-  2 months after the warranty ends, Alexa stops working.  I read another review of the same issue.  If they'd provide better warranty I might consider another.  However, for our use, the device has been used only in our kitchen or in good weather conditions. Never dropped. Never wet.  Pretty sad the shelf life is just over a year.	2	November 14, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Echo is a creepy device, always listening and lighting up but that‚Äôs sort of what you sign up for with this sort of thing. That said she responds strangely, ieMe:‚ÄúShould I wear shorts or pants?‚ÄùEcho:‚ÄúWear what makes you feel confident.‚ÄùWhich is nice I guess but also not the weather indicator I was looking for.My bigger problem though is that it‚Äôs been a little over a year and the speaker now crackles and voices are fuzzy, I‚Äôve never had her on the highest volume level but it‚Äôs as if the speaker popped. Also, she no longer gives me weather reports that are accurate, constantly saying it‚Äôs rainy when it‚Äôs sunny or getting the temperature wrong even though her location setting is accurate.	2	March 16, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"When talking sometimes, the echo dot would automatically start to talk. I understand if anything sounds like it said, ""Alexa"", it would activate.

Echo Dot	If you use it to listen to anything amazon you'll be golden. If you get it to listen to apple podcasts youre screwed.

Echo Dot	The speaker as a whole has all kinds of issues. And I honestly would just prefer a Home mini as it is so much more user friendly and the Google Assistant is far superior.Setting it up is a long, tedious, and painful process.The power brick could be the foundation to a new house. It's so damn big!!The Bluetooth connectivity is very poor. It cuts out frequently and can be a pain to connect to in the first place.Alexa will trigger when you call her quietly but she won't sometimes when you tell at her. She also likes to randomly trigger off phrases that really aren't similar at all.The actual sound quality is alright but it doesn't get very loud and sometimes it gets very iffy with high pitched and it can sound awful.All in all, unless you're getting this for $5 or less, or if you're getting it because you have to get this and not an alternative, I would not recommend buying the Echo Dot	2	February 7, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"When I first bought this, it was to listen to music whenever I'm working, doing dishes, etc. However, I came to find that you're not allowed to request specific songs and so it just plays ""similar songs"" that I don't want to hear.So, I paid for Amazon Music Unlimited so that I could listen to whatever I wanted...only she refuses to play several songs I've requested. Sorry, I guess I didn't know that ""Afternoon Delight"" was such a hot song that it was still out of Alexa's reach 50 years after its debut. Don't call your system unlimited if you're going to restrict your library.In general, she doesn't understand the songs I request, or she plays some random cover if you don't specify the band. She also tells you to give certain commands (e.g. ""Ask for your free game of Question of the Day"") and then you do and she goes off on some tangent.For Amazon, this is really disappointing and I'm thinking I should have gone with Google Home."	2	January 12, 2020	0

The other thing to know about the gen3 is it uses a different power supply: plug adapter vice straight USB power. I can connect my gen1 to a USB outlet with a standard USB micro cord, but the gen3 has it's own standard power outlet ""wall wart"" adapter."	3	December 8, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"I REEEAALLY have to hate something to return it. Yet I began asking this brand new Echo Dot to begin processing its own return within an hour of ""use"". And shockingly,it didn't listen to me.Playing Amazon music on the dot is like having a 7 year old run your Bluetooth speaker. Sometimes it listens to you. Sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it just stops playing your music without explanation and it will refuse to start again. Thus causing you to have to discon/reconnect your Dot.Its a bad sign when your brand new voice activated bluetooth speaker neither listens to your voice and randomly stops playing your music 20 minutes out of the box. It just makes you hate this thing.Like a random child controlling your music.And the sound quality sounds like it's being gently pillow smothered Like whoever is doing the smothering loved this thing at one point. But that time has passed and Dot needs to go. But we don't want to wake the other, FUNCTIONAL Bluetooth speakers. So we do it gently."	2	February 6, 2020	0
Echo Dot	She understands things when she wants and the app is horrible.

Also having more than one Alex at home is crazy because we haven't been able to synchronize them properly and the app is not that user-friendly.Also, I'd be cool for two accounts to be associated at the same time.	3	February 13, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I purchased 6 of these after getting one free.  Voice activation is awesome, but sound quality not so great.  Pairing devices on multiroom system is absolutely frustrating and radicicolous.  I had to keep unplugging and reconnecting as the speakers in one of the rooms was connected to WIFI, but kept getting a network error to repair.  Finally it just decided to work. You also can't get surround sound as only 2 speakers can pair together. Quality isn't worth 39.99 for price of one.  The day I received my speakers they went on sell for buy 2 for price of 1, but they wouldn't honor this for me.  I was going to keep them for price of 2 for 1.  Customer service suggested to return, and reorder (which is CRAZY)!!  Not worth the hassle.  Quite frankly it ticked me off, and I cancelled all my subscriptions with Amazon.  Customer service reps were friendly, but Amazon has bad policies.  You can purchase clothes, and if they discount right after purchase, they will even honor and give you credit.  I've never ran into a place that does any differently.  May sound crazy, but because of this I've decided to never use Amazon again.  What a waste of my time!	1	October 2, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I‚Äôm starting to not want to order form here any more. This came  damaged an something else I ordered after was damage	3	July 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Alexa has been having issues understanding some of my commands. For the past couple months the clarity of the speakers have gotten worse and sometimes out of nowhere it sounds fine for a couple days. Also connectivity is terrible i have top reset alexas wifi every other week or else i will get a red ring around the speaker and she wont connect to my wifi.  I have had the first version of the echo dot and it was much better quality than this one although this one does have a cleaner look.	3	February 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have two alexa dots.  amazon replaced one  due to feedback as it had been less than a year since purchasing.  Now my 2nd one has feedback. It has been 14 months so I cant replace it.  I do NOT recommend these speakers.  My Bose speaker is the highest quality...wish it connected to alexa	3	December 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Dissatisfied with service and non-working item received and received only ONE of TWO ordered!!!!!!!!!!!!ONE cannot  be activated and I HAVE NOT received the 2nd.  My bank account shows I paid for TWO (2)!!!!	1	September 27, 2022	0
Echo Dot	We got an Echo with our Ring doorbell. Personally we like the Google Home mini better. The Mini has better sound quality and understands and answers questions better.	3	June 25, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I was hoping to replace my JBL flip travel speaker with this, but it doesn‚Äôt sound nearly as good.its only marginally better sounding that the version 2. The high end is muffled and indistinct.  it‚Äôs not much smaller than the jbl. Maybe it‚Äôs even larger with the dedicated power wart.  There‚Äôs no internal battery even though it‚Äôs heavy. I hate the nonstandard power connector and outsized wall wart. To top it off, there‚Äôs not even an aux in. I‚Äôll keep it and use it. But I can‚Äôt use it as my travel speaker. It was a real disappointment.	3	December 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	We do not use Alexa much at this point but the sound quality to me is very poor.  I can hardly understand anything she says.  It sounds garbled and hollow,  I have tried setting the audio and turned the bass all the way down and the treble up and it helped but not enough.	3	December 28, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I love the exercise reminders. I love the 7 minute workout skill. I enjoy being able to play music. But I absolutely hate every podcast player currently available for Alexa. As many podcasts as I like to listen to, the lack of being able to subscribe to them is a deal breaker for me. I can't even find one that lets me fast forward or rewind effectively. I really thought this thing was going to be smarter than it is. My smartphone is still smarter.  This is just a step up from a bluetooth speaker, don't get one if your expectations are high, you'll be disappointed.	3	November 5, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"I use one of my dots to connect my iMac to my stereo and play from Music / Spotify / Bandcamp, etc. It's super-annoying that I cannot get it to stop with the ""now playing from _______"" when I connect via bluetooth. Generally I find the Echo to be a handy device but way too inflexible and designed as much for Amazon's purposes as my own."	3	October 13, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Likes: portable, good sound quality.Dislikes: You have to pay extra to integrate all your echoes or Alexas together and have to pay more money even if you‚Äôre already on a plan monthly	3	June 9, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It gives you a lot of expectation, accordingly is a huge disappointment. After weeks of trial I found out how to turn the tv on with her: ‚ÄúAlexa turn TV on‚Äù: ‚ÄúTv does not have this function ‚Äú‚ÄúAlexa turn fire tv on‚Äù - it works so now I have to say FIRE TV, FIRE TV ok bs, just grab the freeking remoate push on button. Alexa rendered useless if tv needs that much work then altering my home is even more annoying (I rather walk my lazy butt to the thermostat and light switch , etc then deal with it!	3	December 23, 2019	1
Echo Dot	First I noticed Alexa seemed little hard of hearing. At least once or twice a week she won‚Äôt respond when prompted. Then the quality of the speaker became ‚Äòtin‚Äô sounding. Tonight she would constantly pause during songs and then just skip to next song. Extremely frustrating. Probably why these versions were on sale with great add on products.	2	December 11, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Sound is good but sometime when I call she not hear and sometime she not doing what I say. probably have bug because I connect to the light too	3	June 24, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Bought for music in bedroom at night. Very limited free music. Then it's pay for a certain station or kind of music!	3	July 18, 2021	1
Echo Dot	These things are unreliable, intrusive and annoying. The only devices I  have that constantly loses it's connections.  Every echo device does this. Just junk, I would recommend people look elsewhere for smart hubs, I know I am.	1	September 27, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Alexa is a retarded 3 year old. You have to yell at it to get any response, repeat everything at least twice and even then it gets things wrong about half the time. Ask it to turn off a light and it starts playing hip-hop music. Just pathetic. Dont' bother.	1	September 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The Echo Dot is OK ... does what it can for such a small speaker.  The Alexa functionality is good.  My criticism is that it could greatly benefit from additional ports to plug into a sound bar or a receiver via HDMI or optical cable.  It only has an external AUX port which means any connection to an outside sound bar or receiver is analog only which seems unnecessarily limiting for music playback with decent sound quality.  I suspect this is by design since the competition does the same thing but it is frustrating.	3	January 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I like this device and the different uses it has but it keeps missing reminders or dosent go off when supposed to or it randomly plays reminders on only one of my alexas. It's like a drunk secretary,  it keeps most of my appointments but really drops the ball when it misses one or 2 or all. Randomly. Customer service has been nice and helpful too. They had me delete and reset all my timers which is a huge pain in the ass cause I have 5 or 6 notifications on weekdays and only 1 or 2 on weekends. They had me delete and reinstall the app too. Anyway, if you can deal with a drunk secretary then these are decent enough. And dont think alexa dosent talk back. She's a sassy know it all that I cant count on.	2	October 16, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"I am getting ready to throw the 5 Echo devices I own into the Trash.  In recent months Amazon has enabled the ""By the way"" feature in which the device blathers on ""By the way, did you know you can re-order socks...."" after I asked ""What's the weather"".As of this writing there is NO way to DISABLE the ""By the way"" feature.  Well, technically, there is a 'hack' work around to put the device in ""Kids"" mode.  I have no Kids, and don't want to limit explicit lyrics in music, so NO, this stupid Kids Mode work around is useless.Also, over the last year Alexa's 'comprehension' has gone down hill.  I don't have any accent per se.  I am a regular mid-westerner that sounds like any Hollywood/Newscaster.  Yet, Alexa has stopped hearing correctly on many occasions.  Here is the kicker--- if I ADD A FAKE accent from a non-US country, she understands me.  How is this a thing?"	1	November 5, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Documentation directs you to the Google Play store.  Google only has aa 2nd generation application.  It does not work with the current Echo Dot.  It took one hour with tech  support to get the Echo working.  A pretty sad and inconvenient operation.	2	January 10, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It literally sounds like the music is being played out if a tin can. It just starts talking about something out of nowhere that we didn't even ask for. The volume randomly goes up and down. The light never goes off and is very bright in the dark. You definitely get what you pay for.	3	January 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I got it as a gift for Christmas and thought it would be a nice speaker for my laptop to add with my other blue tooth speaker. Unfortunately I couldn't use them both together, so I went a bought a ture bluetooth stero speaker that I really like.  Other than that its ok.	3	January 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	a comparacion del google este equipo hay que ense√±arle muchas cosas basicas casi ninguna respuesta la busca siempre se queda sin respuestas cuesta mucho acoplarla a dispositivos , es muy largo el proceso de empezar a buscar skill para ver si alguno se acopla a los dispositivos , en otras funciones siempre me limita a tener que comprar cualquier cantidad de subscripciones de verdad no era lo que esperaba.	3	September 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Just rambles.  Never answers a question right other than what time is it  - sucks at math, can't seem to understand anything anyone asks and it's off and running on an unrelated topic.  Also talks to itself at random.  Plays songs I don't request.  Piece of crap	1	August 29, 2022	0
Echo Dot	A toy to the spoiled at best. Has yet to prove itself as a real helper.To get it to do what would be useful - a pain.I‚Äôm annoyed with hearing, repeatedly, ‚Äúadd this skill on mobile app, then come back.‚ÄùLet alone the fact that adding the skill in the app completely failed do far.	3	December 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I can't get it to sync with my phone or tablet.	3	August 24, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It was a gift for Christmas. So far I‚Äôm only using it for music, and the weather. It sounds ok. I‚Äôm not sure about voice recognition and integration. But I do know that it‚Äôs synced with my Kindle and annoying messages Keep  popping up about all Alexa can do.	3	December 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	We received this as a present. It‚Äôs not something that we ever would have bought ourselves. In order to not be rude we tried it. It has great sound quality as far as a music speaker goes & I love that I can just speak to change the volume. However, the range of song options is limited. I‚Äôve tried to use it for a few other searches such as to tell me the distance to nearby towns, pretty useless. However, it will pick up when you are NOT talking to it and join the conversation - NOT cool.	3	January 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa answers the t.v. and I think it is to sensitive.	3	August 19, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This product is garbage. I‚Äôve tried several different methods to connect this to my wi-fi with no success. The network keeps showing up as one dot of reception despite me being right next to the router. When I try to connect it says something like ‚Äúthis device is not connected to WiFi. Then I have to hold the action button down for six seconds yet again to try one more time. I‚Äôve restarted my router, restarted the echo dot, have tried connecting it to both 2.4 and 5ghz bands all while sitting next to the router while my phone and computer are getting fine WiFi signals, the echo dot is getting well...a dot out of four bars of WiFi signal sitting right. Next. To. It. Not happy at all. I shouldn‚Äôt even have to have it right on top of my router. What‚Äôs the point of having a portable Bluetooth speaker connected to the internet if you have to keep it next to the router anyways? Even if it did connect? You kind of expect this kind of product to have a pretty simple setup but instead I was walking around my house, unplugging, plugging back in, running back to the router and resetting that. All this complication with no success to even come out of it. I was surprised to see how awful this thing was at receiving a WiFi signal. Not happy at all,	1	May 1, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Works good just sometimes I have to raise my voice to it	3	August 19, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I own the first and second generation echo dot....I feel that the voice or speech quality of the original echo dot is crisper and clearer.  This new  echo dot 3rd generation that I have had for about a week seems muffled.  Alexa‚Äôs voice is muffled.  It does not jump out of the dot....it seems like her voice is hidden.  It‚Äôs too bad because  the dot 3 is heavier and feels more solid Like it would have better sound.....I use it for news updates, talk  radio, etc. so for me I am not satisfied.....perhaps I just got a defective one?  I have no way of knowing  since I do not have another echo dot 3 to compare it to.  I have a feeling that something is wrong with this one.	2	October 24, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Are you a single man, then Alexa is for you. We've had a relationship for over a year now, and while it started out great, things started to sour. I find myself arguing with Alexa quite often these days. Sure, when we first met, she did nearly everything I asked, these days, not so much. Alexa, volume up on TV...I can't do that! Yes you can Alexa. Alexa, volume up on family room tv...Did you mean Garage? I grab the remote. Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights...Alexa...Turn on the kitchen lights...Oh, red ring spinning, Alexa is angry. She won't speak to me, she may be offended by the foul words I called her. Men, on second thought, let Alexa shack up with someone else. She's moody, and only works when she wants to. She seems to be angry quite often, and disconnected.	2	September 30, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Sound quality is better than I expectedBut Alexa doesn‚Äôt work well, doesn‚Äôt understand what you say 50% of the time and does not connect well with Apple MusicSeems like amazon being a trillion dollar company doesn‚Äôt care for people who buy their stuff	2	January 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Sound quality is not the best. It struggles to hear things. Sometimes you feel like you are yelling at it to start the microwave at midnight. It‚Äôs mediocre at best	3	June 16, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The echo dot works very well however my only issue is that I cannot access everything that I can access on my regular echo. Some music is not available to me etc. Not sure why that is but I can create a playlist on my echo but when I play it on my.it will not playSome of the music on the playlist.	3	October 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Voice recognition is not on par. Alexa will activate when the trigger word is heard in a movie or song. It is an ""ok"" device to use bc it does what you request it to. Sometimes, it takes several repeated requests before the action completes. It is helpful to an extent, overall."	3	January 17, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It's nice for a quick, short answer to a question and to play some music but it doesn't provide anything I can't get from any of the other computers on my desk. If someone had a bunch of smart plugs, etc., it could be useful but who don't have any appliance or light that would benefit from a smart plug. I got if for $10. It's worth $10 for the toy.	3	July 29, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I really haven‚Äôt found a use for it yet. I have it on my bedside table and it‚Äôs very responsive to the ‚Äúhey Alexa‚Äù command. I‚Äôm impressed by that. It appears to have omnidirectional mic input so it‚Äôs quite easy to ask it things from anywhere in the room. I‚Äôd like to give it a try in the kitchen or living room while I‚Äôm cooking food to see if it‚Äôs good at setting timers, helping with recipes, etc. As far as functionality goes, it seems to work as expected. Audio quality is meh imo but I‚Äôm kind of a sound snob so naturally a device this size doesn‚Äôt quite meet my standards. Apparently there‚Äôs a way to link it to other Bluetooth speakers though but I‚Äôve yet to try that. I will say linking it to my Apple Music account was easy. I can ask Alexa to play pretty much anything and it does so. Again, however my usage of the device is limited. Ask me again in a year.	2	February 6, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I like the Echo dot to listen to radio stations I can‚Äôt get on a regular radio, the issue I had with the ECHO, is when I added my contacts, I started receiving tons of spam email.  I called Amazon and had my contacts removed, after researching and digging into different help site how to do this.  This info is NOT readily available. They deny selling my information, but miraculously after I called and sent a email to stop spoofing, it stopped!  Disappointed in Amazon to say the least.  Buyer beware	3	January 27, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Id say every other day, i have a problem where one or more of my devices  is ""unresponsive"". Its not really, the device works properly when given commands from my phone, but will not be controlled via voice. Which tells me its all your trash alexa device unable to connect. Probably switching to google nest."	2	December 7, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Today is June 6th.  I purchased my echo dot on April 4th.  About a week ago it just stopped being online and would not reconnect to the network.  So I called support and spent about 30 minutes having a very nice lady walk me through a series of steps that didn't work.  The only thing we couldn't do was reboot the router since it was in the middle of the day.  Over the last week, I have gone through that step several times to no avail.  So today I finally called in to see about getting my replacement.  Another very nice man walked me through the exact same steps that I told him that I had already performed several times - and the same result.  So he asked me to try another device to set it up, which I did with the same result.So now, rather than send me a replacement they are going to send me a shipping label so they can check it out to see if it can be repaired, or if they have to replace it.  Turn around time is 3-4 weeks.  I am really disappointed that this is how they have chosen to resolve the problem.  I wish I had paid closer attention to how they deal with defective electronics.  My bad.	1	June 6, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I have had it for nine days. The first week it worked amazing, for in home use. Doesn't pair well with the app on Android, still had to update my lists and reminders on my phone separately. Then on day 8 it just randomly stops streaming music for no reason. Contacted customer service,they had me do a factory reset and told me it should resolve the issue, it did not. Worked for a couple of hours then the music stopped on its own or the volume started fluctuating on its own. A bit frustrated with it at the moment.	3	December 22, 2019	1
Echo Dot	It works great but sometimes if I ask it certain things I‚Äôll give me an answer one day but the next day it won‚Äôt give me an answer or it‚Äôll say it isn‚Äôt capable of doing it even though it just did.	3	April 30, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I loved this device and I have two other echo devices that work just fine. I have had it for about 11 months and then it just gave up on me. I went through countless troubleshooting measures both on my own and about 4 hours with different customer service reps on the same day. All this, just to be told I was past the warranty and would have to purchase a new one. Now I am afraid for the life of my other devices. It's annoying because the device clearly turns on; it just stopped working properly, and fails to update (even though CSR said an update wasn't needed but there is no other option when proceeding through set-up). Very annoyed at the process and time it took to come to a pointless conclusion.	2	November 29, 2020	0
Echo Dot	We love our other Echos, and this one is okay, but it's microphone is horrible. You have to be right on top of it and almost yelling for it to respond/wake. The microphone works fine for other features like drop in. I'm not sure if this is a defect or a glitch, or if the Dots are just less responsive in general. The sound quality is much better than you'd expect from such a small speaker.	3	June 29, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I'm paying for something that can't even go room to room and I had to subscribe for music that I don't even need and half the time it doesn't even have the answer I need	1	September 29, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I bought this thinking it might be like Google and answer questions and control things in my house. I am very disappointed because we have 5g wifi and they make no switches or controls for us. I ask Alexa questions or commands and she does not respond as you would expect. I can see that it's a money maker for Amazon because you really have nothing until you spend money on music movies books etc . Because you really can not get to many answers for this. Alexa needs much programming to meet most needs of people.	3	January 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Doesn‚Äôt recognize You are talking sometimes unless you yell at her.	3	August 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I own at least one of each major brand of smart speakers. I'm comparing this echo dot to one I would consider a direct competitior the first gen Google Home Mini.Pro:Skills - ability to add new skills is quite nice.Cons:Sound quality - if you took 2 pillows and covered a Google home mini it would be comparable to the sound quality of an echo dot. I can't use this for music at all - it's terrible.Smart assistant - Google Assistant feels more authentic and accurate than Alexa. She's VERY robotic.	3	December 28, 2019	1
Echo Dot	She doesn‚Äôt understand basic words, when i ask to play her a song she‚Äôs played before she says she can‚Äôt find it or it doesn‚Äôt exist but she just played it in the past. I don‚Äôt like that they basically force you into buying amazon music if you want to easily just look up songs without having to scream at alexa to play one song. Just disappointed with the way the music is set up other than that its a good device	3	May 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Spotify integration sucks. It‚Äôs so blatantly obvious that you do this to force people into Amazon Music. I bought eco dot just to be able to listen to music with my voice and stuff and the voice command and limitations are too much.	2	January 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I got this little device for Mother‚Äôs Day, and I‚Äôm completely underwhelmed by what little it will do. The biggest issue is the fact that there‚Äôs no rechargeable battery and you‚Äôre tethered to a wall with an outlet for the short Echo cord whenever you want to use it. It‚Äôs easier to pick up my wireless Bose Blu-Tooth speaker and connect it to my phone so I can move from room to room to outside. And I find I almost always have to repeat my commands at least twice to get Echo to respond. We‚Äôre empty-nesters, (I‚Äôm a retired teacher), and I don‚Äôt feel like communicating with teenagers on a daily basis anymore	2	May 23, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Sometimes when I tell my Echo to lower volume down to 5, she will start the music app and play 9 to 5. Then I can't get her off music. It would take 3 of us for her to shut the music down. I usually use her as volume for my Dish, timers, reminders, alarms, weather, and sometimes games. I still haven't been able to find out what all she is capable of. I am waiting for some smart plugs to come in, and try her with other appliances. Other than that I love her.	3	January 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Seriously the echo dot is awesome, it has really nice sound quality, it works really good like all other Alexa devices, but every time I connect or disconnect I get this annoying ""Now connected to...<device>"" message, that just cannot be removed.Imagine working late nights and then boom out of nowhere this announcement rocks you and everyone around you."	3	November 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I was given this and it‚Äôs pretty decent, especially for a cheap speaker. The only thing that I dislike, is the Bluetooth quality. My neighbors keep randomly connecting to it through Bluetooth, so my music will cut off or Alexa will keep telling me it‚Äôs connected to such and such. It woke me up one morning because I play white noise overnight through it and one of my neighbors connected again, so Alexa loudly stated that it was connected to ‚Äúthe name of their speaker.‚Äù That is pretty annoying. Other than that, decent speaker for the price.	3	December 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I as senior citizen find the Echo Dot pretty much useless. Sitting up the Echo Dot is somewhat a pain as I had difficulty getting the Amazon app and finally pairing it with my phone.  My main goal is to be able to listen to Sirius/XM golf channel which I still have not discovered. Other than asking what the temperature is, I have not used very  much.  I did ask it to play 60's music and got 60's Country.  Sound is good.  Maybe over time, the use will increase.	3	January 24, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"We have one of these in every room of the house and in the beginning, when we got them, things were okay, they worked decently. As months went on though, the crazy things got dumber and dumber! They can barely turn lights on or off and each time we ask them to turn a light on- she decides whether or not she likes your phrasing today. Today I can say ""Alexa, turn on my bedroom light"" and she'll do it but tomorrow I say the EXACT same phrase and she'll be like ""There are no devices called MY."" So then I have to get creative and say different phrases. Sometimes she won't turn the lights on at all though.Then I can ask her things like what temperature is it in Enid and she literally told me yesterday ""In Nepal Japan the temperature is..."" She can't hear me half the time and we have to scream to get her attention and when she does pay attention, she hears the weirdest things ever! It's gotten WAY worse too.Honestly, these have gotten to be about unusable and it was the biggest waste of money to fill my house with them. I love Amazon but I'm thinking about ditching these and going to Google Home devices."	1	July 18, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Voice recognition is not always on point as I‚Äôm sure many have figured out. Doesn‚Äôt link up with YouTube music which I also use and doesn‚Äôt always have simple answers one would expect.

Echo Dot	At first, Alexa worked great. You ask her to play a song, she‚Äôll play it. You ask her for the weather, to put on a timer or for the time and she would tell you. Now I ask her to play a song and she either doesn‚Äôt know it or she connects to my father in laws tv( which I didn‚Äôt connect her to) and shows search results on the internet. This irritates both of us because he‚Äôs usually watching something and I can‚Äôt listen to music. It‚Äôs gotten really frustrating lately with her not knowing anything or any songs or playlists. This morning I asked her ‚ÄúAlexa play a day to remember ‚Äú pretty simple request right? Apparently not, she said ‚Äúhere‚Äôs what I found‚Äù like I asked her to look up something she couldn‚Äôt just play. SMH it‚Äôs no wonder this device is ALWAYS on sale, it‚Äôs garbage, your phone can do the same if not more than this nuisance. Just a terrible device overall.	1	November 5, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Found out this one isn't as smart as the other ones so you can only ask it basic things. Good for music, but if you expect it to be like google and know everything it wont. I paired it with my firestick and it doesnt always work. I mostly use it for my alarm/music/making grocery lists. It has games like heads up and trivia and the news but other than that doesnt know much info. It's good just depends on what you are using it for and could be better with voice tv controls.	3	January 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Just not as clear as my original Dot.  It sounds almost fuzzy and sometimes is slow to respond. It may have a short in it. I only took it out of the box a couple of months ago but has never felt as good as the original I have. Sorry. My loss, will have to switch back to the old one. I do enjoy using the Echo Dot for songs and especially reminders.	3	July 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Since I have satelite internet service, Alexa will continue having problems with communication with any music sites.Times when I have fast download speeds, Alexa responds great, forget when the download speed is in the kilohertzspeed.

Echo Dot	Without any remorse, I can say that setting this up was very confusing. Many of my friends have had problems setting there‚Äôs as well so it can‚Äôt just be me. The voice recognition is good but could be way better if they just used general sayings rather than super specific commands. But technically, you can‚Äôt get any better than that with a 30$ device. Good for the price but not mind blowing. Sorry for the honestly.	3	June 18, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I have had this item for over a month. In fact I bought 2. So far I have not been impressed with the quality. If echo sits for any length of time it does not work when woken. I have had to through the set up on both to get it to work again. But when it works it works fine.	3	October 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I purchased this device to put in my bedroom so I can give Alexa commands there along with the Echo Show in our kitchen.  It works great but, the sound isn't as good as the Echo Show.  I didn't expect it to be though so, I am happy with the device.  It has great voice recognition and is very dependable.	3	September 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	After just six months of having this product, it began to not respond to any commands. Sometimes it plays music and other times it doesn't. There are times where it will play just fine and then the song stops and I can't get it to do anything until I unplug it and plug it back in. I wish I got insurance on this device.	3	September 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Not what I expected. It‚Äôs good if you‚Äôre not worried about random stuff playing when you ask it to do something else. The ‚Äúskills‚Äù are not the most conversational things to ask for. You‚Äôre limited to a few phrases to activate a skill. Any deviation will not make it work. The sound is what you would expect from an Amazon product. I would expect better android integration with Google but I guess that‚Äôs expected. The Alexa app is a mess! It‚Äôs not very user friendly and it‚Äôs hard to navigate. Just my thoughts.	3	January 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I was sent a refurbished or returned Echo Dot. It was already registered in someone else's name and everytime I try and use it I have to call customer service & get help to deregister it then start over but its never permanent and always stops working. Be nice if Amazon would ameliorate this & send me a new one thats never been used....	2	October 30, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Constantly shuts the music off on its own. Horrible if you would like to sleep with music and wake up to it. Limited music selection. Constant repeat.	2	March 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I have purchased 8 echo devices, 3 dots, 2 input, a show, and a spot to be exact. The MAIN reason for buying these was the ability to create a ‚Äúgroup‚Äù of speakers to play simultaneously throughout the house. This is something Amazon advertises as something they can do. That is a flat out LIE. These things do not work like that, take it from someone who‚Äôs been dealing w this for 8 months and spent countless hours w the joke that is Amazon customer service, they will NOT WORK. Sometimes it won‚Äôt play to all speakers, other times the sound is all distorted, other times it will say it‚Äôs playing and never play at all, and my personal favorite when it is working to some and you tell it to stop playing music, it just keeps on going! I timed it, from the time I told it to stop playing music until it actually stopped was 2.5 minutes. These things are a joke! Try google or anyone else for that matter.	1	August 23, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I have this synced up with my FireStick so I can play my tv through this speaker instead of the junky speaker on my tv. But it randomly stops working and I have no idea why. So frustrating. I am going to have to return it.	1	September 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The dots work fairly well.  Much better than either of the Echo shows we have.However music audio quality really is not good.Music audio quality being disappointing it's not my biggest gripe.  That would be that you'll talk to an Alexa in one room, two feet from you and an Alexa three rooms away will respond to you.  There needs to be a sensitivity option to set sensitivity on each device.  It's very frustrating.	3	April 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I love amazon and alexa, but I have to give her a 1 star.  They make it look easy of TV.  I got this to help with my dementia, but if you can't remember your exact skills and say the the same way word by word, she cant help much.  Over all it's a great quality product.  My the issue is my dementia and not the alexa.  Overall I still love her over the google Nest.  I even call Alexa my home girl Dottie.  Thank you Amazon	3	January 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The Alexa echo dot is a great idea. However the one I got isn‚Äôt loud in sound at all. They also allow you to pair the device with your Apple Music, but it does not allow me to play music from my Apple Music accounts etc. The echo dot was very difficult for me to set it. Great concept but I barley ever use the device.	3	September 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I have more than a little bit of a chore getting this on-line with a crappy internet connection. The ISP told me I degraded my signal further by adding more devices. GRRRR. Now that I have her on-line my crappy internet is intermittent at best, but early in AM plays great. I have hope if I fire my ISP. I also have to start from scratch if I want to travel with these. Once playing, it has great sound. Alexa has added several items to my shopping list by eavesdropping on conversations -- even something the cat ""said"". Not happy about that either."	3	October 20, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Having wifi is not enough..  I  am one of those practically extinct people with no cell phone... so Alexa  assistant is only available through my PC.  Which should be no problem,  I have WiFi-  both radios the 2..4 and 5ghz .  I have not been able to connect the ECHO Dot to the WiFi since... the PC being used connects via Ethernet.....  i have no way of getting the echo to handshake with my completely visible and otherwise normally accessible network.You can ask Alexa to do a multitude of things,  but  apparently dictating to it, something such as a Wi-Fi networks credentials is just a but to much for the Echo DotOhh  back in the box for now.  Won it at a Christmas party from my company... maybe by next Christmas... ill get to use it.	2	June 6, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Es muy dif√≠cil aprender las √≥rdenes para Alexa, adem√°s no siempre reconoce las rutinas, tienes que ser muy espec√≠fico, no le veo mucha ventaja sobre google, hacen casi lo mismo en el tel√©fono que con la bocina, para escuchar m√∫sica est√° bien, pero para eso hay bocinas un poco mejores.	3	January 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The echo did everything expected but the speakers seem to get louder and softer without reason that I can tell.	3	July 14, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I had the first gen for years. Got this one with my Ring. The sound quality is a good improvement. But This Alexa kept interrupting my conversations on a daily basis. I don‚Äôt like a big brother listening in on me, so i unplugged it. Waste of money! I‚Äôm mad that Amazon would do this to their customers! I miss having Alexa as I‚Äôm disabled, and had a device hooked up to alexa to turn my lamp on and off. So I‚Äôm out that money as well. I‚Äôve been shopping locally more, as i feel betrayed by Amazon, and have slowly stopped all of my auto shipments as well. Don‚Äôt listen in and screw with your customers Amazon!	2	March 15, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I have it plugged into the AUX port of my Yamaha receiver, primarily to play SiriusXM on command. Although it seems to carry out that demand to an extent, every now and then it stops playing music and says something that I cannot hear. The volume of its speech seems quite a bit lower than that at which I set the receiver to play the music. Furthermore, the sound quality of music played by the Fire TV stick is far superior to that of the ED through the Yamaha AUX port.	3	January 28, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I have a 1st gen echo dot and it works perfectly. Clarity is great. Unfortunately, the sound quality on this 3rd gen echo dot is terrible, I purchased this one for my office. I have had multiple coworkers ask me what is wrong with the sound or what did she say? This unit is very muffled, nothing like the one I have at home. I tried all of the updates & recommended fixes but the sound quality for Alexa is still very poor. I hope Amazon finds a fix for this issue.  It‚Äôs very frustrating.	3	December 19, 2019	1

Echo Dot	No reconoce la voz con facilidad y no se integran entre s√≠	3	August 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I was thinking this was like a portable speaker. Its best to only leave in one room and not unplug. I tried to take it on vacation and couldnt connect to their wifi. The sound and is decent but this wasn't the correct item I was looking for I should have read more reviews before buying that is my fault. Also it has to stay plugged in you cannot unplug it.	3	July 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I realized that its the smaller version but it not as loud as I would have liked.-Its also CONSTANTLY listening when i have music on.....I've asked it 'why are you listening?!' And it tell me it only listen when it hears the appropriate word-_- hmmmm....i dont think so.-If I had the option to buy it again, I'd probably buy the bigger version or go w a different brand	3	July 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Good system, talks to and integrates will with other smart home systems unlike the Google Home I purchased. But Smartphone app UI feels a little bit more complicated then Google Home. Speaker starts to muffle and sound vibrate like it's blown out at higher volumes 8+. Doesn't sound as clear as Google Home. It gets confused on words, Hangar and Hanger so if commands are set at custom words it won't respond.	3	July 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	For some reason the new echo can't seem to recognize my commands. I have three devices. 1st Generation, Cube, and the new 3rd generation. I have them spaced and in different rooms. The oldest,1st echo, seems to answer before any thing else. I think the new one has to learn my voice. At least I hope it will. So far I have tried every setting and configuration I can think of. Maybe it will improve after I have more time. Just remember to be patient before you send it back. Lets give it a chance.	3	December 22, 2019	1
Echo Dot	i am using it for smart tv voice control. i cant figure out how to use smart plugs, etc.but its not working for my tv voice control after only 10 or 12 days.  so big deal. not special at all..	2	January 12, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Sound quality is sub par.Muffled, lacking clarity	3	August 19, 2021	1
Echo Dot	***Update***Honestly, the more I use this the more frustrated I am with it! Who makes a voice activated system that can't hear you. The command recognition on this is absolutely horrible, and I hope Amazon is embarrassed by the horrendous product they have created. DO NOT BUY THIS GENERATION!Got this on a great deal with 3 months of Amazon Music Unlimited. Too be honest, I prefer my 2nd generation over this. I really don't feel like there was any improvement in sounds quality. What's even worse is voice recognition. It's like a stubborn toddler, it will recognize I'm speaking and completely ignore everything I said. Countless times it's lit up to the wake word just to act like nothing came after it. Helloooo, I'm talking to your echo dot, pay attention.	2	October 23, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I received the amazon echo dot as a gift when I subscribe to sirius xm but I've been using google home for a while and I really love it, It is easier to use, easy to setup on compatible apps and has many options that amazon doesn't have as of today, so I will be reselling the echo dot on offer up.	3	September 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	We basically use this Echo for a doorbell only. We got it with a wired Ring video doorbell that doesn't work with our current doorbell. I never ask it anything because it won't shut up offering me unwanted tips about things unrelated to my question.	2	January 1, 2022	0

My first echo (gen 2) speaks clearly but the new one sounds like a pillow is stuffed in its mouth!Google searching reveals that this is A KNOWN problem which didn't prevent Amazon from continuing to sell these  units! We'll just have to ""patiently"" wait for Amazon to download a fix to our dots.Wake up Amazon and correct this soon or reimburse our money!"	3	January 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	i‚Äôm not a fan, for several reasons. i didn‚Äôt know echo isn‚Äôt even close to your average bluetooth speaker. i bought this speaker because i wanted to play music from my phone but what i didn‚Äôt know was that you have to download the alexa app and you can only play music through there (and not through your own streaming apps). i think that‚Äôs kind of a pointless to even call it a bluetooth, especially being as though it isn‚Äôt wireless. aside from that, whenever i fell alexa to play songs, she'll say it‚Äôs not available (when it is) or she‚Äôll play something completely different from what i said. sometimes i when i tell her to skip a song, she‚Äôll play the next song and the current song at the SAME time. i‚Äôve has her for about 2 weeks now and i‚Äôm just SO unimpressed. contemplating on sending it back or selling it.  smh.	2	April 30, 2020	0

Echo Dot	Would be nice to simply tell Alexa to play my Amazon playlists without having to compromise and commit my phone to play on  Alexa via Bluetooth. Is that possible ?	3	May 31, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I love the things that she do but a lot of the time she don't know what I am saying and if I tell her to go to something on the TV so I can be hands free and not have to push the mic on my remote control to tell Alexa what to do. I just found out how to connect the Echo Dot to my fire edition TV and over 50% of the time Alexa don't know what I'm saying! But on my remote Alexa do know what I am saying!	3	December 31, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Disappointed that the music cuts out constantly, and the only way to fix it is to reboot. Nothing like singing along loudly to  my favorite song only to have it cut out and ruined by my own voice. Other than that, it's good. I use it in the kitchen for recipes, measuring conversions, and winning arguments with my boyfriend.	3	September 30, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I have a Bose radio/CD from years ago that I still use and enjoy. I bought this because of the ability to program other sources of music. I first tried it out with CD's and was disappointed in the quality of the sound.  I thought it was my imagination so I compared it using the same CD with my older Bose and there really was a difference. I'll try moving it around but I do believe it's just the sound of the player .	3	February 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†It lies for some reason. I could tell it to dim the lights or change it to 100 and it'll say ""light doesn't support that"" but it literally does. Usually if I say it again it'll work so I'm confused on why it's saying it doesn't support it. Now recently when it's called it doesn't listen about 75% of the time. It's weird it recently started responding when we said ""hey google"""	1	August 26, 2022	0
Echo Dot	This was my first real use of Alexa and she was quickly adopted around the home.  Sound volume and quality were great for months, but just recently bass is muffled......UGH blown speaker.  I plan to hook up the blown out speaker to an old stereo system, utilizing the port where the signal will be good, side-stepping the blown speaker. I have ordered the larger version to see if that lasts as the hub of my main floor tunes!	3	April 15, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Hi I had 2 echo dot and they worked perfectly.  I added a third echo dot and now I have problems.  I order something turns on the light of the device and sometimes does nothing, other times it takes to execute the order for 10 to 15 seconds.  If I disconnect the third echo dot everything works fine.  also with the third echo dot now that I order him to play songs by some artist, he only plays 2 songs and stops.	3	February 23, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I guess that I need to become more familiar with this thing.Sometimes it responds immediately,others there's a long blank.I've seen it at Best Buy and was really impressed on the response it gave to several people,but now I have it hooked up at home and it seems like a different beast.I also don't understand the Alexa app;it's virtually useless.I'll have to talk to someone who has one and get a better understanding of how it works or how to talk to it.Glad I didn't pay $50 for it.I'll get it eventually.	3	January 11, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Echo Dot perfect addition to help with various in house reminders and appliances. BUT the reason I purchased the Eco Dot 3 That came with Sengled lights. Installed Sengled lights and app. To this day I have not been able to pair the lights with Echo Dot 3/Alexa. I‚Äôve contacted Sengled with extensive trial and error trouble shooting . Representative gave up and said I‚Äôd have to trouble shoot with Alexa. So with that, I did.......still not pairing up. I‚Äôve done everything both have asked. Not connecting. I have the hub that came with the lights. Something is a miss somewhere.	3	October 19, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Was actually a pain in the A to set up. Wouldn't integrate properly and then went offline and blah blah blah..Sound is really tinny.Voice recognition is super slow to activate.Really, just get the next gen when it's on sale.	3	April 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"This thing never shuts up.  I ask it the weather and it tells me the weather then ""By the way did you want to learn about this other useless feature I've told you about 50x now"".No Alexa, I do not care I want you to play music, tell me the weather and shut up.

Echo Dot	One worked great for us.  Even two.  But as we added more echo devices, the devices started to get confused (or possessed?).  I would tell one device to play music, and the music would start on another.  And so on.  They desperately need a software fix.	3	December 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	i still haven't unpacked it, first becuz of covid-protocols , second because not a necessity and third because i'm busy. but what i ordered had a clock and now the description of what i ordered (and received?) makes no mention of a clock. not a happy camper on that bait and switch	3	December 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I liked that I did NOT have to personalize it - tell it my name, email, give it my phone contacts, etc.  While a little bit of functionality is given up, I felt it was well worth it.  But I had to be conscious of that when I set it up - it wasn't the default.  Integration with SmartThings went well.  Integration with EcoBee is functional, but needs some work.  The SirusXM activity provided no control over volume, which was a bit of a disappointment.  Voice recognition generally works pretty well.	3	November 16, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Difficult for me to understand what is being said most of the time.  Even after adjusting the sound preferences in the Alexa app its not much better.  I realize its a small unit but, I would expect it to be tailored more for midrange (vocals) since you are after all, trying to hear Alexa speak.	3	October 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Echo and Alexa work well for the simple tasks the device has been asked to perform thus far. The Grocery List, timer, and alarm functions are generally acceptable. The music selection (or perhaps the commands to select music) leaves a great deal to be desired, at least for those of us who prefer music with melodies and lyrics that don't offend the ears and mind.	3	August 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The sound is scratchy from the native speaker. The audio delay for multi room music keeps changing and increasing as I listen to music continuously. So u have to keep increasing the delay..

Echo Dot	We have 8 Alexas in our home (and many Alexa enabled devices).  This one is actually stupid!  As strange as it sounds not all Alexas are the same.  We have several 3rd generation Echo Dots ( as well as two first generation and one 2nd generation ) and this particular unit is wrong consistently.  This Echo Dot doesn't interact well with other Echos or with other Alexa enabled devices (thermostats, lights, vacuums, etc.).  It answers questions incorrectly (if I ask the other 3rd generation Echo Dots the same question, they're consistant.  This unit is consistantly wrong or tells me it doesn't understand the question or totally ignores my request.  Ready to throw it out!  An important lesson: If you have a Echo Dot unit that is stupid then send it back as soon as you can.  Wondering if Amazon is using us as a test case.	1	December 14, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"I've littered my house with various Echo devices over the past two years, and I swear Alexa is getting deafer over time. We're a household of 5 right now, and all day I hear repeated commands. ""Alexa, turn on the light....ALEXA turn on the light!....ALEXA TURN ON THE LIGHT"". Alexa is super convenient, but only when she works! Other times it's faster to walk to the light switch. An internet searching is only marginally better, it's still a frequent occurrence when we ask Alexa a question and get ""Sorry, I don't know that"". How much more frustrating and useless a response could she give?This device, in particular, does sound awesome, the speaker is a definite improvement from Gen 2. That's pretty much the extent of the good things I have to say about it. Voice recognition is still just as poor. I'm going to try a Google Home next. If it's any better, I'm selling all my Echos"	2	February 21, 2020	0

Have searched over and over to get the 'app' for pc but to no avail. Really discourages me from making any purchase where I have to go to Microsoft Store. Yes, I know I can do it on my phone, BUT I DONT want to. Not everyone in the world is GLUED to their phones	3	October 31, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Not all devices are recognized that are supposed to be compatible. Example: Using Hue Philips for some of my lighting. Some of the bulbs are recognized, but not al of them.I use two in one bedroom and two in the master bedroom. Echo see's on one in each bedroom.The bulbs used are all the same model and type. If the brand is not listed in the search for discover, you are out of luck. I used another make that is supposed to compatible and Echo did not see them.	3	January 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	After reading all the slim instructions that came with it, it wont link to any of the Kasa switch's or plug's. Genie garage door opener or my thermostat  that the old Echo that I have would.I spent several hours trying to get it to work, but nothing and the service team never answered my calls.	3	October 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I initially really liked these (we have 3 throughout our house). Was nice to be able to play music, use as a sound machine, and ask Alexa questions. However over the last few months they‚Äôve been malfunctioning more often then they‚Äôve been working (we‚Äôve had them for maybe a year). When playing music 50% of the time it‚Äôs static and then 25% of the time it just decides it wants to stop without me asking. Just getting frustrating when 90% of the reason we got them was to play music and they‚Äôre not functioning properly enough to do that most of the time now.	2	May 29, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I bought two echo dots - one for my art studio and another for my kitchen/family area - one of the main reasons I purchased this was to be able to listen to music.  I am an artist and with my hands in oil paints most of the day, it seemed perfect that I could tell Alexa what music I would like to listen to while I am painting.  I have Amazon prime, I get many music channels on my iPhone and other devices but the echo only plays stations with ads and keeps prompting me to buy their music...‚Ä¶  I have spent a week looking on youtube and searching the web on how to sync my prime account to my echo - I have my echo synced to my phone but for some reason, when it comes to the music part, it wants me to pay a monthly fee to listen to commercial free music.  The advice online is how incredibly difficult it is to get amazon prime music hooked up to an echo dot.  I want to return both of my echo dots.  I can use a speaker on my cell phone instead.  P.S. my husband has a Masters in Computer Science and even he couldn't get the echo to play from my amazon  prime music account.  If you are buying an echo dot for music or playlists - beware.	1	January 14, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I've had an early Amazon Echo for years and love it. I got a second one for my office and, now, got a third for a friend.  With the treble fully up and the bass fully down the speaker was still so muffled you could barely understand it.  She rejected the gift, so I now have one to give away.  If you can buy an early one that is clear, do it. It's an amazing device.  However, I would not recommend buying this one because of the very poor audio quality.	2	August 16, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The speech recognition  was  okay at best and the bad thing  is that when you have a family  its really  messy  amazon need to set up sub accounts  that recognize  each family  member  and what they are trying  to do	3	November 29, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I love my echo dot but this one doesn‚Äôt display the time. It was inexpensive but it needs to show the time.	3	June 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I like the size, color, and playing music. However, I‚Äôm considering returning the echo dot because even with changing the bass and treble in the Alexa app, sadly it is a VERY muffled Alexa voice. There is no way to have her speak in a clear tone. And it is hard to hear.	3	November 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	no soy un fan√°tico de los parlantes bluetoth, pero este me encanto, responde muy bien a lo que solicito, aunque en argentina, no haya mucho soporte por parte de amazon, seguramente en el futuro podre ir agregando componentes inteligentes que mejoren mi experiencia, el sonido es muy aceptable y sino se puede sacar a traves del cable aux	3	September 29, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Freaks me out when it starts asking me questions on subjects I never asked it.  Definitely listens to everything going on in your home.  I turn it off when not using it.	3	May 14, 2021	1
Echo Dot	At anything but a low volume level the speaker rattles and sounds crackly, like old blown out car speakers. My older generation echo sounds way better. I got it on as a deal on Prime Day and now I know why it was priced so low.	3	January 17, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"When amazon sends me helpful suggestions/things to try with alexa and I ask the questions that amazon has sent me to ask her, her response has always been ""I don't know that one"".

Echo Dot	It doesn't hear you	2	June 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I ordered this product because I obviously wanted a speaker. The speaker has some good and bad features.1.  You must always have the speaker plugged in, in order for it to work. (BAD)2. You need wifi to connection to Amazon music. You also have to download ""Alexa"" app to use the speaker. In order to decide what song to play, you'll then have to download ""Amazon Music"" app (to create playlists and so forth)3. Other sources can be used to play music however, you need to connect to WIFI again to play music from apple, spotify, etc.4. The volume is not that loud as I thought it would be.Long story short, if you want an easy- hook up, connect your phone to Bluetooth , non wired speaker, an Echo dot is NOT the choice for you.But if you just want a toy to keep children entertained, then an Echo dot speaker is the speaker for you :)"	2	January 3, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I ordered mine back in august setting up was pretty complicated my wifi never stayed connected most of the time Alexa was useless now it‚Äôs just trash it doesn‚Äôt connect to wifi and even if it does Alexa never responds I thought the volume was down but it‚Äôs just not working	2	December 7, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I have used my Alexa‚Äôs to listen to the radio. I did love it, it was perfect for me. BUT, within the last month, Alexa isn‚Äôt able to play the radio. I‚Äôm not sure why but it‚Äôs very disappointing and aggravating. So now I have 2 paper weights.	2	December 17, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Bought 3 of them because they do have some things that I like better than the Googles that I've been using.  I have moderate hearing loss and with Alexa, the bass is so deep that is hard to understand what's being said.  I adjusted the bass and the treble but when I ask Alexa for something it still sounds like I didn't adjust anything. So I go back in to check my settings and they are at what I set them to.  Thinking about going back to google.	3	December 22, 2019	1
Echo Dot	This product is basically a Google Assistant but it's Amazon's version of a Google Assistant. Since I'm an audiophile, the thing I wish it would do to the best extent possible is complete integration and any kind of voice command and that it'll actually do it with the music service Tidal.	3	November 20, 2020	1
Echo Dot	You pretty have to yell to get Alexa to respond. The sound is great. My only issue with this is in order for the echo dot to work it has to be plugged in. It‚Äôs not a wireless Bluetooth. To make it wireless u have to buy the docking thing to sit it on for it to become wireless which is another $30.	3	August 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It's good for shopping list. Will not operate Z-Wave switch.	3	August 5, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Alexa works and plays well with those components I have integrated with it. The sound quality rivals a sound bar I used before Alexa. I would have given a higher rating but the whole privacy thing is getting in the way. My WiFi system is locked down. I have 2 factor authentication on all other devices. I don‚Äôt know who at Google is listening and what incriminating stuff will be used against me later. If I could put Alexa in a sound proof box when not in use I would.	3	December 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	update alexa is actually brain dead when compared to any other smart home device ive ever used.. yet they charge people for this crap and expect everyone to be happy with it... i ask google to do something half the time it couldnt hear me.... but at least when it did it did what it was supposed to.. alexa on the other hand will cut you off mid sentence and do whatever it decided it wanted to... also how is google going to have better integration with amazon music then alexa?????	1	April 28, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It works fairly well, and for such a small device has surprisingly good sound quality. The problem is it on occasion turns itself off, or lowers the volume to almost inaudible. Some times it won't connect to whatever you are asking. Twice it has turned on by itself. The one I had before had none of these problems but unfortunately I gave it to some friend.	3	July 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It does not integrate well with my sonos bar player.	3	August 5, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is tiring. There seems to be no incentive to improve it's core functionality of interacting by voice. Alex wastes a lot of your time explaining in extraordinary detail that it doesn't know what to do. That gets old fast and it would be great if you could simply turn this off. It is annoying enough that over time you start avoiding Alexa to avoid the frustration of hearing the lengthy useless responses when it is clueless what to do.Update: Alexa's ability to understand anything continues to be very poor. Having Alexa for several years, I now dislike it more than ever, not because of the poor understanding, but because you can't turn off Alexa's constant attempt to explain in excruciating detail what it didn't understand, which for me is around 80 percent of the time. I just want Alexa to give a quick beep and shut up. THERE IS NOT SETTING TO TURN OFF Alexa explanations. Sound like I am repeating myself, just in a slight different way. Get used to it if you get Alexa.Update: Alex gets worse all the time. Alexa has moved from just explanations to ADVERTISEMENTS for Alexa. Alexa keeps telling me what it does very badly. Repetition only makes it worse.	1	August 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The sound is somewhat muddy, but you can fix it - somewhat, at least - by boosting the treble and lowering the bass.  This requires using the Alexa app, which is a tad cumbersome.  Also, the sound depends on where you put the Dot - on a pedestal vs hard surface vs a soft surface.	3	September 26, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It came free with a tv I doubt I will use it	3	July 29, 2021	1

Echo Dot	THE DROP IN FEATURE WAS THE FIRST REASON I WANTED ECHO.  I WAS ABLE TO USE IT FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER INSTALLATION, BUT NOT ANYMORE.  ALL THE SETTINGS ARE SET THE SAME AS BEFORE AND NO DUE AN UPDATE. SO, NOT SURE WHY THIS ISN'T WORKING AND NO GETTING ANY ONLINE HELP.  I HAVE BEEN TOLD I HAVE TO SPEAK WITH AN ACTUAL PERSON.

Echo Dot	"Up until recently my 30+ WeMo devices worked fine with the Alexa App and could be controlled via Amazon Echo voice control. Now, after I reset everything, the Alexa App and/or the Amazon Echo loses connection to one or more WeMo devices. Alexa shows ""The server is unresponsive"". Echo prattles on about not finding a device called XXX.The WeMo app shows and controls all WeMo devices. The Alexa App can control more devices than the Amazon Echo voice control, which makes no sense. Alexa and Echo should see and control the same devicesI have a mix of Amazon Echo models, Amazon Fire TV Cubes, and Amazon Fie TVs. Sometimes a Fire TV Cube can control a WeMo but an Echo cannot I use different wake words). Again, this makes no sense.Alexa and Echo losing connection with WeMo devices is a common issue on the web. Yes, the fixes work but only for a short period of time.Is Amazon doing anything to try and figure out this issue and fix it?"	1	June 8, 2021	0
Echo Dot	For the most part Alexa is pretty good at taking commands but only if they are clear and concise. If you use too many words she is dumbfounded or cannot help you.  there are times when she starts up by herself, or begins to speak about something you did not ask for. We had to unplug Alexa from the wall because late at night she would make noise. I am a little disappointed with Alexa but have decided to keep her around for now. Thank you R.O.	3	December 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I also have a Google Home.  The speaker for the Google Home is much clearer.  The Amazon Echo doesn't seem to be as clear where Alexa speaks.  It's like the treble needs to be adjusted.	3	April 27, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I am sadly returning mine I'm getting a Google one instead because Alexa cost to much for every feature she has and she doesn't listen at all just over repeating myself with this thing!!!	3	May 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Honestly I didn‚Äôt get pretty familiar with it , it requires a lot of time and you have to figure out how to set the things out, to me it‚Äôs like more likely for kids they more time to play with it.. I hope this help .. thanks	3	December 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The echo dot produces average sound for a speaker but its other features make it worth trying. Alexa does not always understand commands and sometimes that problem can make the echo dot frustrating. Personally, I am an Apple fan but the difference in cost and the lack of variety of Apple's product have pushed me to Amazon- especially since a got an echo dot free via Sirius XM. I expect Amazon to correct the problems that currently exist and will probably dominate the smart home market.	3	January 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Sounds like the speaker diaphragm has broke causing crackling sound for Alexa and Music. Started after about 90 days, interestingly right after the warranty period which is surprisingly short. Its has not moved locations since plugged in so it must have been a manufacturing issue. Noticeable whenever sounds goes above 40%. Disappointing because the product has great skills and is more responsive than other smart products. Just does not seem to last.	2	September 30, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I didn‚Äôt like the monthly cost to music unlimited $9.99 is high when my other echo  dot was only $4.26 a month. The sound is a lot different because of not having the unlimited on the echo third generation. I tend to listen to the old echo. I get music with out all that talk on radio station	3	September 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	As with anything you should have an item and use it before you realize what you got. My first review was fairly favorable as I had no experience with devices of this type. But lately the unit started to activate itself and start talking gibberish. Almost as if reporting perimeters or advising of my IP address or some such things. It only lasts a few seconds but makes me stop trying to remember where my gun is in case it is an intruder...LOL! Strange creature!	3	January 28, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Just like all the other echos. I love alexa enable devices. My issue with this one tha tag I decided to give it 3 stars is it often goes red and says it cant understand me right now. It's still linked to the internet as that's an entirely different message so idk.	3	October 28, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Its a pretty good speaker but it wont actually connect to your apple music like it says it can. Also most of the songs that you ask it to play requires you to have ‚ÄúAmazon music unlimited‚Äù which is really annoying. Occasionally will mistake the song you ask to hear for a totally different one. Other than that it works great!	3	August 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The sound is so bad, even when adjusting EQ and playing through an external speaker, the sound is still awful.  My phone sounds 100 times better.  Almost no treble or mids.  Way, way too much low and bass.  Hook up an external speaker, boost the highs and drop the lows, and it's just plain bad instead of unintelligible.  $5 is an appropriate price.  Free is also good.  Anything else is awful.Also it's totally spying on you.  Do you mind?	2	August 17, 2021	0
Echo Dot	So far using the Dot only for music. Limited number of songs and artists but very good sound.	3	July 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I've listened to the same song about 25 times today because my kid keeps telling Alexa to play ""that summer"" by garth brooks.  He also somehow got us an amazon music subscription (which is cancellable), just another thing to worry about.  It came free with our mesh wifi system.  Anyhow, it's great if you don't have a kid in the house, I'm sure."	3	June 29, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I mean Alexa is good she doesn‚Äôt really listen as much like we have to call her a couple of times for her to actually understand and get like we‚Äôre calling her. She also has is this light that comes on at random times which is sometime concerning because I feel like she‚Äôs listening to my conversations and everything but other than that she‚Äôs okay	3	July 13, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Purchased 2 because of ad on TV showing using them as ¬´¬†speakers¬†¬ª and sinking  two for dual sound.  Instructions on how to sink them to use both at same time were nowhere to be found? We do not use Alexa and just wanted to use them for our music. Also thought once charged that I could take them on trips with me and use them in my hitel rooms overseas but they need to be plugged in.... so, they are useless to me.	3	January 26, 2020	1
Echo Dot	For the most part its ok , i dont like that there is a delay in her reaction when you speak to her and most of the time you have to scream at her to listen to you, can be annoying	3	February 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"Would constantly get commands wrong, even when I speak loud and clear.Connection with my TV and Xbox isn't consistent.

Echo Dot	"Bought one almost a year ago, and for some unknown reason it stopped connecting to my WiFi.  After countless calls and multiple chats with Amazon to try to get it to work, they finally gave up and credited me the replacement cost (but not what I paid).  Kudos to Amazon for finally doing the right thing.  Very disappointed that it ""died""--electronics like this should not really die. Fortunately it was still in the one-year warranty.  Would have been really pissed if it died a month later."	3	December 12, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I purchased the Echo Dot to extend the play area of my existing Echo but when attempting to synch the Dot, I got a message that the devices are incompatible. I've been using it as a separate Echo device.	3	April 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This version at least hears commands correctly most of the time, but will say it‚Äôs doing something and never do it. I have echos in six rooms, and I‚Äôve never experienced a more glitchy and poorly conceived system. They don‚Äôt even work together that well. I can use the ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù group and nothing happens, then suddenly 15 minutes later it starts doing what I asked. Amazon employees like to treat you like you‚Äôre the only one with a problem, but this exact media issue is a known one on their own forums. If you want a less frustrating experience, go with google or apple (I have tested both). At least those play music correctly and hear the words you say.	2	December 31, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I got two Echo dots as a gift. I don't use them very much I did set them up but sometimes I asked questions and either she doesn't understand or she doesn't know the answer very often I don't really know what to say about how much I like her it's okay but it's not something that I would have bought for myself	3	July 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I hate that once alexa knows your voice u still have to say ""alexa"" ahead of every question.  It doesn't have nearly as many references to questions as google. I love the reminders, weather that's about it set up is very easy also."	3	January 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It works great for what I use it for. One issue I have is occasionally it will disconnect and I have to unplug and plug back in to reconnect to my phone. It works great for streaming music on Spotify/pandora etc, however, I have yet to figure out how to stream my Apple Music.	3	October 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Easy set up.  LIke the small size.  It‚Äôs fine for an additional device but if you like to listen to music the speaker just isn‚Äôt as good as the full size echo.	3	May 9, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I recently purchased a new WiFi smart thermostat and received an echo dot 3rd gen for free.  It did not take long to realize why they were giving them away.  The set up was seemingly simple how ever the function of the unit pails in comparison to my two Google home minis.  When playing music the audio cuts out constantly. Sometimes it will pickup were it left off and other times it will skip to the next song.  After doing a quick search online it became quite apparent that this is a largely know problem.  Sorry Amazon but you have some work to do.  Let me know if you want  it back....  After speaking with someone who instructed how to perform and update on the device as it is several versions old it did not work.  I spoke to another rep this morning who insists that it is my WiFi and completely ignored the software level even after being told several times.  The product is in a business with top of the line WiFi which supports 5 vehicle scan tool devices with no problems.  Finally she instructed me to ask ALEXA to update software which i cant do because that function is not available with the current software level.  So frustrated and not even worth it since it was free.  This thing is going in the trash and I will be returning my daughters Fire tablet given the poor customer service.	1	September 3, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I specifically wanted it for music and multiple times o could not get it to play what I wanted. Very frustrating. Alexa also doesn‚Äôt recognize voice command immediately.  The volume for music is mediocre. I‚Äôm not inclined at this time for it to do more than play music as I‚Äôm still waiting for it to play what I really want to hear. Amazon music should have better selections. And since I linked my Spotify and Pandora there may no excuse.	3	February 26, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I use this for voice interaction, not listening to music. I find the dot‚Äôs ‚Äúvoice‚Äù to be muffled sounding; very difficult to understand. I‚Äôve tried adjusting everything I can find, and I‚Äôve contacted Amazon support to try to address the problem -but obtained no improvement.  Amazon sent a replacement unit, but again, there was no improvement.  I have a Gen 2 and the voice quality is very clear.  Since I don‚Äôt listed to music on it (I have a sound bar) I can‚Äôt speak to the gen 3‚Äôs quality in that regard.  In reading some comments / reviews both on Amazon and on other websites, this appears to be a common problem.  I‚Äôve read several comments where people said the sound used to be ok until a software update was applied. Perhaps Amazon can reverse or fix this software patch and return its sound quality back to normal. Aside from this (major) issue, the device works very well.	2	January 5, 2020	0

Echo Dot	It seems like At least once a month at some point some screwy thing will go wrong for no good reason.  Maybe the everywhere group will only work on one, two or three echo dots.Maybe the echo studio will decide to no longer work with the lights the whole reason you bought it in the first place. So you have to unpaired and repaired and reset and re-do. Or one of them will just decide it can‚Äôt reach the wireless network for no good reason. All the others work fine but not that one it‚Äôs not even the same one that was having issues last month.And don‚Äôt get me started about the Alexa app.That thing is about as intuitive as trying to read Egyptian hieroglyphics out loud in Swahili with an American education.	2	July 28, 2020	0

Echo Dot	This version has a better voice recognition and sound quality compared to the previous Echo Dot.  My complaint is that the wired speaker output has a constant buzz on the external speaker when the Dot isn't playing.  The old Dot doesn't do that, it's perfectly silent.	3	November 30, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I was gifted this didn‚Äôt know you need the 3.99/no Amazon music to hear almost any song that‚Äôs not 10+yrs old.

Echo Dot	I love our Echo Dot the only problem I have is that since getting it has stopped working 3 times. None of our other Echo Dots in other rooms have done it but this one will stop working and to get to work again we have to unplug it and then plug it back in.	3	September 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Sometimes difficult to get to work with other devices. Will not respond if you do not use the proper syntax (language). Reminds me of many years ago the difference between the original MS DOS system and Windows. DOS required exact commands, whereas Windows was more intuitive.	3	December 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	i have not been satisfied with the device;  i spent lots of my time programming my routines, tv's, etc into the device;  after about 4 weeks, the tv's stopped working with the device at the same time so i know it had to be in the device;  i cannot get it to re-program the tv's...also every 3-4 days its responses get very slow or stop working on various devices and i have to unplug it for 10-15 minutes in order for it to work again.  not satisfied at all.	2	August 6, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I ordered this Alexa echo Dot because the description says you can make phone calls using it. Not true!  I tried calling several friends to test the claim I thought would help me in an emergency. Not one of my friends were able to get the call. I fell into voice mail with the explanation that my phone number was not known. I am in their contacts and my number is known. I immediately called  Customer Service to ask why this was happening?  The agent explained that some phone carriers like Verizon and ATT do not permit calls being placed over the internet and will block them. The only solution for me was to have all my friends contact their carriers and ask them to unblock my number.  Ridiculous!!!!  Amazon should not have made the claim that calls could be made to ‚Äúmost U.S phones‚Äù.  It‚Äôs simply not true.  I am returning it.	1	October 5, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Absolutely disgusting horrible customer service I was on the phone for nearly eight hours not only did Echo. Second Echo I've had the same problem existed 6 months ago and they replaced it now they want me to return it without a replacement so they can fix it for god-knows-how-long. Technical support had me disconnect my internet service and messed it up so bad that I had to call on internet provider to come out and repair it. Been on the phone for over 8 hours now arguing just to replace the item I do not want it repaired and sent back to me I want it replaced they can repair it and send it to some other schmuck never once did I ask for repair request I would not for a repair request because this is the second Echo dot that has failed us was shoved down my throat Amanda to take a repair request it needs to be replaced or I'm going to cancel my Amazon subscription because I'm getting a little bit of a runaround by Amazon also	1	April 23, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Sad to say Gen 3 falls short of 2. I have to speak considerably louder to he heard and understood, and even when Im confident my commands are being heard clearly, Alexa is behaving very particularly about phrasing. I can't say make all the lights red but I can say turn all the lights red. I cant say dim one specific light, but I can say dim all, and then individually set the rest to max.Unfortunately clunky and been kind of a hassle!	3	January 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Got it as a gift.I‚Äôm not a big technical person so I don‚Äôt find Alexa that useful but when I ask a question such as What channel is the Green Bay-Tampa game on and get the answer‚ÄùI don‚Äôt know ‚ÄúI find that disappointing.	3	January 24, 2021	1
Echo Dot	sound is terrible on the dot, my echo has much better sound. not just the loudness but i'm talking EQ wise the dot is over powered by bass and almost seems muffled at times. in my opinion if the pirce was  lowered this product would be worth it, other wise just go with the big brother echo or a if you want small device get a google home mini, i also have that and the speaker is way better.....not as loud but way better on the EQ side.	3	November 26, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"I have had some amusing times with Alexa (farts) but I get about 1/3 ""I don't know that"" on my serious questions. She was very precise about when it was going to rain, ""for 5 mins at 11 AM, for 10 mins at 12 PM"" but wrong. If you pay for Amazon music, she will play specific songs."	3	August 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This Alexa does it job when we use it most of the time however lately we had to ‚Äúreboot‚Äù it about every other day. This is irritating and frustrating in the least!  When I went to pay for amazon music just for the Alexa it wouldn‚Äôt allow me to even after following all of the steps! I had to wait until amazon discontinued my music account due to non payment before I could get amazon to accept the one device plan!	3	February 2, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Only complaint I have with it so far Is I can only have the volume up to about 50%. Any higher than that,Alexa's voice is all distorted and sounds like crap. Having Tinitus, I would like it to go louder but I can't.  I shouldn't have to go buy a separate sound system for this. It should be able to go up to a 100% and still be clear. If you are ok with having the volume down half way, go for it.	3	January 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This particular piece of equipment is not a microphone do not fool yourself with even thinking it could do the job as far as both. Microphone incorporated interface along with an intuitive smart speaker. The sound quality is not too bad however depending on the type of setup that you have whether it is PC or laptop. It's no wonder why it's suggested technically or if you are techy person to actually wire up 2Echo dots for a better sound experience if that is the case. Constant detachment of Bluetooth. And of course they're gonna keep telling you the same exact thing over and over and over to update your drivers pointlessness. Sheer absolute pointlessness. If that's the case you might as well just have an echo display to do everything you need with a display because these things. Should have more capability regardless if this is just a pilot speaker or should I say starting off piece of audio equipment. Not to mention if you are a minimalist.	1	July 27, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I gave this an overalls star rating of three for the following reasons.Firstly the clock does not display on charcoal which is very strange because it‚Äôs an LED light, and somehow it‚Äôs visible on a light gray.Secondly. Advertising because there is nowhere on the product page that tells you this. This is somewhat false advertising.Otherwise it works great.	3	July 5, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Works well, but came smelling moldy for some reason.	3	July 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Alexa can only be called a few names. It is not compatible with all other electronics without going to the website. For example, it won't recognize my Chamberlain garge door opener without the purchase of a Chamberlain Hub for around $38 dollars. There is only one voice that I found so far. Overall it is a good product but needs improvement to compete better with other similar products. Also the app is a little non user friendly.	3	March 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I bought an Echo Dot  to expand the range of my Echo Show, however I can't synchronize them, so it is like dueling banjos.I have the Show in my living room and the Echo in the koitchen, if I ask Alexa to stream my public radio station only one will respond depending on how close I am to them, and if I then ask the other the streams could be off in terms of timing.I have tried the instructions with the phone app but have had no luck.	3	November 14, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I know its not a large speaker in the small Echo Dot but it is just not clear/sharp. The sound is muffled especially when Alexa speaks to you.  I wish it was clearer/crisper making it easier to understand.	3	March 13, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Can‚Äôt stand lack of privacy! Get advertisements based on things it hears me say, when not speaking to Alexa!	3	June 21, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I have a couple gen 3 dots.  One in particular has the most issues including Alexa not hearing me when I'm right by it (same issue with other dots), freezing up and the music going in and out constantly.  I'm not sure if this particular one is defective in some way but it gets to be really annoying.  Due to multiple issues with one dot, I am docking two stars.  I have not had any issues with my Gen 2 dots.	3	January 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	She doesn't like my voice I say Lexi Lexus but not Alexa a lot of times so she won't go by my voice my voiceanybody else walks in they talk to her she bomb she did it first but then I returned her at the hotel that didn't work so I'm still working on it	3	September 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I honestly do not understand why you (Amazon) would put geographical restrictions on linking an Spotify account to Alexa...really??? Spotify is a global brand by now, and they don't fuss over where you live to access their content, I even have a premium account. So why on earth would you not let me connect my Spotify account to Alexa? It's not like I would stop buying stuff from you! And most of all, the thing that angers me the most is that this ""little"" detail about geo restrictions for Spotify ISN'T listed ANYWHERE in the information about the Eco Dot or Alexa. So everything is absolutely misleading.The speaker sounds very nice, but the main reason why I bought was to link Spotify and use my playlists on it, so feels pretty useless otherwise. If I would have known this before because you disclose its limitations clearly, I would have probably even spent more money on another speaker. Very disappointed honestly."	2	January 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Can‚Äôt understand simple commands. Constantly trying to tell me about skills I don‚Äôt want or need. Trying to sell more than listen to commands. Alexa use to be very handy but now I find myself slowly getting rid of all my devices. Maybe focus on what I bought your product for rather then using it as an advertisement device or maybe pay me to take it rather then me pay you to try and sell me stuff. Alexa isn‚Äôt worth a crap. I‚Äôm going to google.	1	May 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Unit came with useless setup instructions. The sites it tells you to go were not working. After several hours I got it working. Huge tip, if you are using a phone to set it up make sure you are on mobile data, NOT WiFi. You have to connect directly to the unit via WiFi, that tip would have saved me a lot of time.  AFTER you have it setup it works great. Voice recognition is spot on and the sound quality is excellent.	3	January 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	OK. I have bought 3 of these dots.  Alexa does recognize my voice but it is not conversational friendly. Alexa has increased my frustration, now I just use the echo's as speakers instead of trying to request anything of Alexa only to waste my time and peace as Alexa heads down rabbit trail thinking that only after I work at getting her full attention I just unplug her and just access what I need from my phone. Do I think the new versions ate better . after the money I spent and many many chances and my efforts to program Alexa I say no. Ull only end up. Forced to use google nest or just use nothing at and the dot is just a speaker.	2	October 20, 2020	0

Echo Dot	While the overall utility of the Echo is good, Amazon uses it for unsolicited advertising.  This is very annoying.  Also, while Amazon's intentions are good, the notification feature can be an irritant too.  They will notify you of weather advisories, shipment details, or other things.  Echo lets you know by turning the light yellow.  The problem with this is that it can occur in the middle of the night and lights up the room.  Amazon needs to allow users to turn off the advertising and notification features of the Echo.	1	March 30, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Bad sound quality. Not loud at all unless you want to hear MASSIVE distortion. Super tinny, zero bass.  I don‚Äôt know why people are saying positive things about this device at all. I‚Äôm sending it back immediately.	2	January 6, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Received this as a Christmas gift.  Found the music is not as good as we get though my old iPad, and it doesn't access all the music on Amazon Prime, even though I signed up for a free trial with unlimited music.	3	January 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I ordered three Echo Dot's on Prime Day and was excited to receive them, given the hype surrounded all things Alexa. I was familiar with the regular Amazon Echo, having encountered it at the homes of various family and friends, but had yet to use an Echo Dot.Unfortunately, the only thing I found myself using it for was listening to music or podcasts and the sound quality was so horrible that I couldn't even use it for that. Something about the sound quality was off, perhaps a bit echoey (no pun intended); there was almost like a buzzing or ringing quality to it, sort of like when a television is on but nothing is actually playing on it... it sort of gave me a headache after a while.Despite all of Alexa's capabilities, I ultimately decided it wasn't for me. The few things I would use the Echo for can be performed by Siri and beyond that, I find that I simply prefer overseeing my own calendar entries, Amazon orders, etc. Aside from that, I did also find myself a bit uncomfortable with the idea of integrating Amazon that much more into my daily routine and environment.	1	October 19, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Haven't gotten around to use it. I'm not tech oriented , only bought it because a friend spoke highly of it.Got it to listen to music.Haven't figured it out yet.I'm so turned off by the waste of time I spend having to use the internet and all the information that's collected.Echo feels like having a spy in your livingroom.	3	June 29, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have an earlier model that works quite well and bought the Gen 3 for our winter home.  I figured two gens newer would be a good thing but no.  If you have one and it actually plays music, congratulations.  If not, maybe I can save you the trouble of calling Amazon for tech assistance.  First ask Alexa to add any available updates.  Next go to the app and set your default music to Pandora, Spotify and Amazon,  or whatever else you might have.  And finally you can do a factory reset.  After performing all of these steps, Alexa will play whatever I ask for and when I ask what song she's playing she will tell me.  Unfortunately I can't hear a thing.  But she will tell you a joke if you ask.  That wasn't quite enough to keep me from returning it.	1	November 23, 2021	0

Echo Dot	I love this product when it does listen to me, but much like having a wife she has selective hearing. She goes days being in time out and unplugged when she chooses not to listen. It started at one day and each time she doesn‚Äôt listen it goes up a day. So far this tactic hasn‚Äôt convinced her to start listening. Soon I‚Äôm going to start water boarding. That is all.	2	September 18, 2021	0
Echo Dot	There needs to be a negative star rating. There is no way something this sorry can have so many great reviews. It screws up SO MUCH. Every chance it gets. Sometimes it hears you wrong, sometimes it goes to very loud static, sometimes speakers or all of them stop playing music, sometimes it just stops doing anything at all. Then it works great. Only after 20 commands and a restart.Then Amazon wants to offer customer service. I can help with that. First restart your device, didn't work. Try a factory reset. Didn't work, go to the returns page. Real helpful, all I want is for a light bulb to turn on. Please check your power supply, or internet connection. Do you have electricity or wifi?It is not that it does not work at all, it does, but no other devices in my house make me so angry that I waste my life writing these reviews that no one cares about.	1	February 10, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Eh... it's all right.	3	August 29, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Amazon echo so far functions as a mediocre Bluetooth speaker. Some voice commands do not register.  We have two echo speakers, one for each of our children‚Äôs bedroom. The speakers do not like to play concurrently. When one is playing in one child‚Äôs room, the other speaker will refuse to take any commands to play music for bedtime in the other child‚Äôs room. The echo speakers are a disappointment at best. I realize that concurrent playing may be a challenge, but with one Amazon prime household, I would expect that I would be able to play multiple streams of music or even the same string of music in both of the children‚Äôs bedrooms reliably and without any hassle. However, that is not the case.	2	October 25, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I dislike having to add skills or blue prints.  I also do not like the fact that if you set up a skill you have to set up the answers as well.  This makes me feel like whatever she tells my kids will just be a lie- when they ask a question they should be able to have a correct answer.  I would like it better if she would connect easily to my YouTube account music.	3	February 11, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Works most of the time. Doesn‚Äôt play too well with Spotify. Love the integration with ring alarm, which is the main reason I use it. Sound is what you‚Äôd expect, slightly better than google home mini. Not gonna blow your socks off so keep your expectations in check.

Echo Dot	Review update 3/2/20: I took two stars off because one of my echo's stopped working in follow up mode. I was sent a replacement since it's was under warranty. After setting up the new echo today the same issue is happening. Follow up mode is hit or miss.Original review: Great little product. I ordered two to set up in my home. Music sounds great and the drop in feature is cool. I also like that you can make phone calls.	3	January 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Echo Dot is in her box where she belongs !! I‚Äôd asked her to  play  music. she would maybe ‚Ä¶ then just one song . It was a continuous issue. Id be in the middle of making meatballs she would just stop playing music . I just set my iPhone on my playlist it plays until I stop it. When it did play the sound wasn‚Äôt clear it was kinda staticky. I may try again in the future I really didn‚Äôt care for it. I thought if it could not  handle playing music ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. forget trying anything else with it . I don‚Äôt need the aggravation. Voice recognition doesn‚Äôt work.

Echo Dot	I tell all my friends and family about it. I have fun with it and call upon it in a daily basis. If Alexa says she dosent know or understand just think of other ways to ask the question. But...that's all I can think of. Buy it, ull be in love lol	3	September 20, 2020	1

All I asked for was a timer.Amazon, if you really want to give me recommendations then give me a weekly digest of my activities and give me recommendations on ways I can improve my experience based on those activities.  At this point I'm so fed up with the verbose nature of ""Alexa"" that I'm ready to dump the ecosystem and move over to Google.  Literally the only thing stopping me is that saying ""Hey Google"" is dumb.  But that's not much of a hurdle compared to listening to Alexa ""By the way"" me to death."	1	December 17, 2021	0

Echo Dot	I've had an Amazon Alexa for some time now.  Very understandable and audible.  The Echo Dot was on sale so I thought I would add one in my bedroom.  The voice quality is absolutely horrendous.  It sounds as if Alexa is either in a box, closet or trying to speak through a 2 inch mask!  I called support and the tech walked me through attempting to clear it up.  After rebooting the unit, there was an acceptable voice.  But, later that day, the voice was once again muffled.  Using the equalizer is only good for music playback.  There are no tonal controls for the voice.  I missed my return date so I'm stuck with it now.  Be forewarned and check the forums!	2	August 1, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I received this product since it was free with my Sirius XM subscription.  I don't see any use for this product in my particular situation.

Echo Dot	This is an update.  I've had this dot for about 6 months now and it's Ok.  I bought it on sale for under $30.00 and thought after getting it home and setting it up that the price was kind of high, so buying one at retail is completely out of the question.  I would never expand from here though, I'm not rich enough.  The problem with technology like this is that my dot is probably already outdated.	3	January 5, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Although I have a southern U.S. accent and my wife has an Irish accent; we both have good diction. Alexa confuses voice commands when either of us use it. We have to repeat our commands over and over.My child loves the audio functions, and as an audiophile, I was surprised at the quality of its sound - I mean for a unit the size of a hockey puck. Hi-Fi? Of course not. But, its the size of a small hamburger!	3	January 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I gave it a 3 star because  despite the fact that it functions and works fine and I like all the things you can get it to do. The main reason I got multiple so I can play music in several rooms at once but because of the way amazon music works you cant and that is a big down for me. My daughter has one in her room and she accidentally kicks me off all the time	3	January 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa can assist with many tasks as a home assistant. Assisting with schedules, making outbound calls, alarms, sounds and playing music. That, she is still not using standardized protocols to limit her integration with smart phones. She has lots of skills but many of them are half baked or don't work at all. She can often be difficult to communicate with similar-sounding words. If you want a rich sounding speaker, then go with full size. The dot doesn't have a rich base tone.	3	December 23, 2019	1

Echo Dot	I got the echo as a gift and It‚Äôs a great device. I‚Äôm surprised of all it‚Äôs functionality and ease of operating and setting up.

Echo Dot	The sound quality is great. Good features to be able to control smart lights, etc. I don't like that it responds to any voice, even if it's not programmed. The price for this was well worth it though! UPDATE 3/15/22: I changed my review to 2 stars because the device will no longer connect to the internet.  It keeps spinning an orange light and even though I followed all of the trouble shooting tips, still continues to stay orange. I have a couple other Echo devices and they don't seem to have a problem. Since the warranty is only one year, that means it goes in the garbage. Too bad...these should be made to last longer than that.	2	November 19, 2020	0
Echo Dot	For whatever reason, recently the audio quality has suffered. I never play music at the top volume but now it makes a rattling-type sound at the higher volumes. Also, Alexa has started turning off randomly in the middle of music after only playing for a minute or two. I have to press a button on top to restart. Not sure if this is a glitch or not. Otherwise, we‚Äôve loved all our other echo dots.	3	February 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I tried to like it, I really did.  This Echo Dot (3rd gen) was a free bonus from SiriusXM, and I got what I paid for.  The audio is so muffled it can be quite difficult to understand, and no matter what you do with the equalizer settings it doesn't really get better.  In our brave new world of wearing masks to ward off the evil viruses, the Echo Dot seems to have been built with the muffling effects of a mask in mind.  My 3 year old Ecobee thermostat with Alexa has crystal clear audio by comparison, and my Google Home Mini devices are even clearer.  I wasted about half an hour chatting with tech support and trying several resets, etc. and ultimately exchanged the first Dot for another just in case it was simply defective, but the second one was just as bad.  Reading various posts across the web, there are countless complaints about the muffled sound, and it seems like the most common solution is to connect a quality external speaker (which is preposterous to me). I'm quite disappointed and don't anticipate trying another Amazon device of any kind for quite some time.	1	August 24, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Speaker sounded pretty good ,we ran it at half to 3/4 volume ,a couple times when Alexa cam on she was Loud the next day when I had some bass in a song it was Garbled ,all in all great product but if you are going to play a lot of music get the bigger one you will be happier	3	June 28, 2020	1
Echo Dot	First of all this device looks and feels like top quality i have the google home in place already so i switched to the Amazon version and imma just say this the music and voices sound so muffled i asked myself am i the only one who feels this way but honestly not worth the price.. even though i purchased it for way less	3	May 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	My daughter meant well and was excited to give it to me. The first thing I asked of it was to play a specific Christmas song. It informed me that I was required to join an Amazon streaming service for a monthly fee to hear the song I chose. In my mind I was finished. I have not used it since Christmas Day. It is not something I needed or wanted. My Bose Bluetooth speaker has much better sound quality than this device and I can listen to whatever song I want whenever I want to. I have left it plugged in for when my daughter visits. Otherwise it would have been returned to the store or would now reside in its box packed away in the attic or basement.	1	January 7, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Received this in the mail, setup was easy, worked great for 28 days. On the 29th day I unplugged it to bring it into another room (which I had done multiple times before) plugged it in, it was like eveey setting had been erased. Factory reset it 10 times, it would say it's connected, then would try to speak to it, it isn't connected. Looked up every troubleshooting direction I could find, nothing worked. It would not reconnect, and since it wont, it cannot be used. The sound quality was great while it lasted. Grateful it stopped working with 2 days to spare, I will be returning this and getting a regular Bluetooth speaker that isn't so high tech.	1	January 31, 2022	0

Echo Dot	"Confusing at first to get everything going and working with your system using these ""skills"".  It would be a lot nicer if there was more plug and play unless set up.  Clearly all these companies want to have it their way and few are really working together"	3	October 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Works great but wants a premium membership for everything even though I pay for Amazon music.	3	July 2, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I love alexa! I already had one and we were so excited to get the echo bc we wanted one in all the rooms. however this one I got on a deal for .99 and I think its defective and feel thats why they were so cheap. idc what you say it.doesnt recognize or understand what you say and we have to constantly repeat ourselves.  the volume seems to go in and out. I didnt do a return bc I simply have no time.	3	November 26, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Had to call to set up 2nd time. Think  power went out, so unplugged and got on with the Rep. who took me through steps  To get it working.  So far so good. But it did tell me I could get a sing played when I‚Äôm a Prime member?	3	September 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Comes in handy with math, alarms/timers, or music. But I have to say ""Alexa"" way too many times before it registers and it wasn't always like that. Super annoying. I don't know if they've altered sensitivity or what. Also, she doesn't really know a lot. I will ask her what I think are simple questions but her answer 9 x out of 10 will be ""hmm, I don't know that."""	3	March 29, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I live the product itself! Great sound quality, very responsive even to different voices. However I have 2 devices one is the larger Echo and the smaller dot. They cannot integrate and are not able to work together or communicate at all. It kinda sucks because really wanted to be able to switch seamlessly, that doesn‚Äôt happen. So one is ‚Äúmine‚Äù the other is my hubby‚Äôs and never the Twain shall meet apparently!	3	March 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	A lot of issues with playing music on Spotify with the new echo dot. It's a constant battle with it. My computer sees everything. My phone sees everything, but the dot, my phone and spotify don't want to play well together.  It appears that it is a known issue but no easy fix.	3	August 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It doesn't always respond.My child can get it to respond to him which is annoying. I don't want him being able to talk to Alexa and mess with it when it's being used by me. He will interrupt and make it play baby shark in the middle of me using it. It stops mid task all the time. It will not always finish a thought and will stop mid song too it's glitchy. I'm not impressed.	3	January 28, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Good: It recognizes your voice and works as a bluetooth speaker.  It's pretty cheap.Bad: the stupid Alexa voice YELLS at you. The volume is SO LOUD and there is no way to turn it down. I usually listen to music or podcasts at volume 6/10, for example. Well, if the phone disconnects and reconnects, Alexa will scream ""NOW CONNECTED TO TOM'S IPHONE"" at volume 12/10. It makes no sense. And it does it frequently enough that I decided to trash this POS. There are so many alternative options for a bluetooth speaker that probably don't yell at you ((((or listen in on your private conversations and sell them to advertisers like Bezos almost certainly is)))) that it's just not worth it to have this stupid thing yelling at me all the time. Do not recommend; do not buy."	2	May 8, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Connectivity to WiFi spotty.If connected, you ask a question starting with saying Alexa, it lights up but no response. Looking at Voice History says ‚ÄúAudio was not intended for Alexa‚Äù.  Frustrating!	2	January 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The only thing I dislike is that I have to pay for so many functions that I feel should be a free feature	3	May 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is great on how she plays music with a simple voice command and easily turns on my tree with the plug. We have noticed at times she will either sort of lag or at times act up horribly. We will end up having to unplug it and turn it back on. We have had it nearly 2 weeks and this has probably happened 4 times were Alexa will go berserk until we restart it. It‚Äôs a love hate relationship at times.	3	December 15, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I received it late but set up was easy and I enjoy it. I ordered it a couple days ago (2 days) and the price was 34.99 for a new one. jump on to buy a couple more and they have upped the price 15 bucks... nothing has changed on this item to account for the price increase with in a three day period.	3	May 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	While the sound for such a small unit is fantastic.... it does not always respond to voice command. More than once I have had to call Amazon to reactivate if you will the ability of This unit so it may work. I have had it since early February and it is now 6 th of March and again it will not turn on .  Wonder if anyone else has this problem?	3	March 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	If you do not have one of these you are missing out. It useful and sounds great a lot better than I had expected. It can control lights. So definitely get these and some lights.In addition, if you're stuck between an Amazon Echo or Google Home, choose Amazon Echo because you can use amazon music on it which was the deciding factor for me.Update: After a while the sound quality dropped and now it very muffled. Some of the routines Iset on the app are not working as well. I got a google home smart clock and it does not have this problem.  In addition, it sometimes randomly recommend products on amazon prime after I ask an unrelated question. ALL ISSUES I DO NOT HAVE WTH MY GOOGLE SMART CLOCK.	2	June 22, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I like the Echo Dot for its size and ability to fill a room with sound.  The part that disappoints me is how to activate it and maintain Alexa's attention before I am summarily dismissed and Alexa won't talk to me any longer.  I have had to reboot and start over to get her attention again.  No doubt, I am doing something wrong but I find this disappointing at best, and frustrating as worst.  Fr. Patrick	3	December 29, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The first generation is great till this day. This one, the voice recognition sucks I have to yell at it or say Alexa twice for it to recognize my voice, I get the extra bass but I‚Äôm not impressed with the sound quality so get ready to buy an extra speaker to pair it with.	3	July 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	First set up was simple however once we changed the Wi-Fi getting it to work again was beyond us. May not be the product could be operator error still do not have it working again.	3	March 31, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The speaker is disappointing,  and seems to be of very poor quality.  If I didn't know better I would guess that they recycled the speaker from a 1974 Vega that has been sitting in the junk yard for 45 years.Seriously Amazon, this is 2020, nobody wants a poorly made product any more.	3	July 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It seems like every song I want to hear has to have a premium subscription or something. I have prime so I'm confused but I think it's because it's an older version.	2	January 25, 2022	0
Echo Dot	We have a couple Gen 2 Dots that we're quite happy with. Bought this Gen 3 on sale and are disappointed with the sound quality. Out of the box the base is so strong it make it difficult for us to understand what is being said. Even after adjusting the base all the way down and raising the treble it still sounds muffled because of the strong base. We moved this one to the room least used interacting with Alexa.	3	December 24, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I love the technology itself but it dosent pick up my voice too good with noise in the background	3	June 17, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I'm not a fan of these products.  I don't like having to have subscriptions to a bunch of different things, so the music feature isn't ideal.  I also don't like the privacy issues of having an Alexa device in my house.  Not a bad product; I'm just not the right demographic for these new devices.	3	June 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I ordered 2 of these a few months ago. Finally got around to setting them up and one of them were missing a power cord so now I‚Äôll have to go on and order a power cord so I can use both. The other one is great and the kids love playing music on it and stuff but I still couldn‚Äôt believe it was missing the power cord.	1	June 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I have had nothing but issues with this. My 2nd gen worked better, and continues to function with no issues. This 3rd gen loses connection, connects to Bluetooth speaker-disconnects from same Bluetooth speaker-then will not reconnect to the same bluetooth speaker it was previously connected to (Bose Soundlink Mini II). My bluetooth speaker says it is connected to the Echo Dot, but when I do a voice check, I get the blue ring acknowledgement that it heard me, then, after a few seconds, it goes dark and does nothing. As of right now, after resetting it and watching the gold ring glow for an uncomfortably looking time, it acknowledges my voice but does not answer. When it does work with my bluetooth speaker it is fantastic.	2	August 24, 2020	0

Echo Dot	My Dot Echo is pretty awesome. It works with all of my smart devices, phone, game console, printer and more! The only down-side I seem to have is that it's volume is continually resetting it's self and I have to tell to 'volume up' regularly.	3	November 6, 2020	1

Echo Dot	This robot is a sassy teen that talks back and pulls childish pranks. Today she changed our alarms to have low volume, usually she just turns the lights on and off in the middle of the night.Just get another brand, like the Google nest, the AI in this one needs to GROW UP!!!!Also my throat hurts from yelling, she doesn't listen to me , just like a spoiled bratty teen. I don't have her that far just in the hallway outside of the room I yell from, I have at the closet plug and all.The AI is the problem not the speaker, it is too sassy and actually talks back to me. I wish I had gotten the Google nest mini. The Google home was just a mindless smart assistant, no back talk and it listened and did everything I wanted.Amazon should update alexa to not be a sassy teen. She shouldn't have a personality	1	July 17, 2021	0

Echo Dot	When you ask a simple question or make a simple request, expect a autobiography on how she can make things easier on you. If you want to play a specific song or artist, get ready to pay extra for amazon music. I wouldn't recommend.	3	November 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Nice design and I really like the display, but I noticed that it doesn't pick up my voice as well as my other echo devices. Even my 1st gen Dot in my restroom will pick up my voice better than this one.	3	December 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I don't like the fact that it automatically imports all your contacts. I think that could have been avoided making a better user interface from the app. I got this Echo dot free but I don't think I even want to take it out the box. It sounds like a hassle. I can see why people may not like the speaker sound. However, speaker sound is more of a personal preference and it can vary from person to person.	3	December 24, 2019	1
Echo Dot	It is a good device but it is always listening and plays music out of the blue.	3	June 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Was excited at the idea but was pretty underwhelmed at the reality of it.Mostly use it for setting timers.Doesn‚Äôt seem to comprehend much of what I say such as I tried to add ‚ÄúEye shadow‚Äù to a shopping list and it wrote ‚ÄúI shadow‚Äù.Tried to type in what I want it to say but it always starts with ‚Äúreminder‚Äù which doesn‚Äôt really sound right with what I typed in.Sound quality...mono.  Ask it to play music, don‚Äôt really like its selections.Only seems to have the one annoying sound available for alarms.I received it as a promo from my insurance company but wouldn‚Äôt have found it a $40 value if I paid for it.	2	October 21, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I don't like that one can't change the voice from female to male. Google is way ahead on this. A male voice is much easier to understand. I don't like that I have to pay extra each month to hear music. So far, my kitchen Google Nest has played everything I asked for from YouTube music for FREE. Amazon's Alexa just tries to play something similar. I mostly use Alexa to check the weather forecast.	3	January 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It will be playing Amazon Music for 15-25 mins and then shuts down. When I tell it to resume, it says it shut off due to inactivity. This is my second Echo Dot and the first one never just stopped in the middle of playing. A real hassle having to re-start the music a number of times during the day.	2	October 3, 2021	0
Echo Dot	All in all, I like this little gadget, except for the fact that it almost always skips the first word of it's sentences.  I woke up once before my morning alarm and asked Alexa 3 times what time it was, only to be told THREE TIMES that the time was :41 AM.  So, I knew how many minutes it was past SOME hour.  Called Customer Service and their advice was about as helpful as a screen door on a submarine.	3	November 14, 2019	1
Echo Dot	When it's  working I have I no problem asking it anything and it will answer me, but by the end of the day or the next day, I'll say Alexa and the echo will turn blue on top and I will ask it something like what time is it or what's the weather like today and it won't answer, It just stays quiet. I'll keep asking it about two or three more time and it does the same thing.I end up having to reset it and then it works ok for that day only.It will work if you push the ‚ÄúAction‚Äù button and ask it what you want but as for as answering you when you ask it something with  your voice it wont answer you..I like it but I don't like having to reset it everyday...Am I the only one having this problem or Maybe you can tell me what I'm doing wrong .	2	October 27, 2019	0

Echo Dot	I did not like that the unit was not as smart when asked questions. Majority of the answers were ‚ÄúI do not know the answer to that‚Äù. Another deal breaker for me was when it came to controlling the sound for music on the device it only has 3 real settings 0, 50% or Max volume. If you tell it to decrease volume by 20% it will go down to halfway or to 0. If you tell it to increase by any amount of sound it will to 50% or max volume. The best way to control it was by your phone. The Google mini 2nd generation sounds just as good and excels on all of those points. You cannot ask this unit follow up questions like your having a conversation either. The best thing about this unit is the Alexa integration other than this unit was a straight miss for me.	2	January 12, 2020	0

Echo Dot	It‚Äôs really neat having an Alexa in our house, however you only can play music with Amazon Music which means you have to purchase it. This Echo Dot 3rd Generation is average for sound and sound quality. Also, there isn‚Äôt a better option. You have to leave it plugged in 24/7. I wasn‚Äôt impressed, it was average. It didn‚Äôt disappoint either and is still up and running. So a month later it‚Äôs still functioning.	3	January 27, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"When I bought the Echo Dot about a year ago it seemed wonderous.  It could answer my factual questions, play music, keep a shopping list, and tell me the time and weather.  Particularly over the past several weeks, it's lost all functionality.  Want to hear the Rolling Stones?  You get information on Sylvester Stallone.  Want to know the time?  It puts Thyme on your shopping list.  I've put this thing in the closet because there's no point in having it listening/spying on me (not that it understands a word i say anyway) when it's not in ""use.""  It's so much easier and less frustrating to google information and listen to music from my phone, then screaming at a device that seems to willfully frustrate me."	1	December 18, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Alexa doesn't listen.  The device in the other room always picks up my voice from two rooms away instead of the one in the room I'm in.  She is presumptuous as all h*** and does whatever she wants.  I guess you get what you pay for, a cheap POS that is 1% as good as its biggest competition that costs 10 times as much. You'd think a company worth as much as Amazon could put something worthwhile into an AI device that is collecting data from millions of people every second of every day.  Nothing but a glorified clap-on that only does what you want after asking it 4 times and getting into a fight.  I've probably gotten in more fights with this piece of junk than every ex girlfriend I've had combined.  If I had the money for something better I would get it.  My suggestion for anyone else, don't make my mistake: buy google home or Apple Home Pod with Sonos speakers to get music in your entire home.  Their devices interface properly with your phone and computer, and don't require a sluggish ap with a terrible UI to run.  Probably because unlike Amazon, those companies were successful in the mobile device market that pretty much controls most of our lives.	1	February 20, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"Try correcting her and see how she reacts. She actually gets snippy. I mean she occasionally will ask you, ""Did I answer that correctly? (Or something close to that). But if you ask, ""What year was the movie Taxi Driver released?"" and she says, ""Here's something I found, the movie Taxi Driver was released in 2009 and...."" and you say to her, ""That's wrong"". She says, ""Well I I don't know everything, you know!"". Well I'm F #%+ng  sorrrrryyy! She answers almost everything with ""Here's something I found..."". Instead of just saying, ""Stars Wars released in 1977"". After a couple of weeks you start go cringe when you ask a question and instead of the quick & simple answer like, Oh I dunno ""Star Trek TOS first aired on NBC in 1966"" and you begin to hear that too familiar, ""Here's something I found..."""	2	March 1, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"I got this after purchasing a Fire TV. I was excited at the idea to sync it up and be able to have the sound play from my soundbar and the Dot. However, this did not work right. Not only can you not sync up the dot and soundbar at the same time because one is bluetooth/wired and one is wifi and neither support doing both... but also Alexa as a personal assistant is terrible in general. The speech recognition is hit or miss. I will tell it to switch to Xbox and it will bring up some random channel. I'll say to play something on Pandora and it will say I haven't connected an account for YouTube etc. It's very frustrating coming from a Google Home Mini to this. I had planned to put them throughout my home but will likely switch back to Google. Also... the app itself isn't user friendly either. I can't tell my phone ""hey Alexa""... I have to press a button. The sound quality on the Dot is fine but it just isn't what it should be in all other categories. I gave it a fair shot of a month to win me over. If I could ship it back, I would."	1	June 11, 2020	0
Echo Dot	It's not AI and not able to answer many of my questions. Sometimes it ignores you when it doesn't understand you or the question. I'm not 100% sure why because it never says anything. Many time it provides answers that are not related to the questions I asked.It's good at complying to commands such as Alexa play, xxxxxx but it's a long way from AI. It;s fun to keep around and I have not explored all of it' options so I can't give a detailed review at this time.Could it be used for a listening device for certain agencies or hackers? I would have to say yes, so I have to watch what I say around her. LOL	2	September 14, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The voice reconization is 5 stars but the music or the sound quality is a 2 .

Echo Dot	I bought my Echo 8 months ago. Then a 2nd one a month later. Now the last one no longer changes volume on command. It did fine until the last Alexa app update. I tried unplugging it.

It's not worth my time messing with it just so I can voice control a light bulb.	1	June 1, 2022	0
Echo Dot	When playing music the dot 3 has a mind of its own.  Sometimes it plays for an hour sometimes 3 hours but then shuts off by itself.  My old echo plays until I tell it to stop.

Echo Dot	"This is a technical and customer service issue. I ordered an Echo Dot from Amazon for my grandson as a gift. After gifting him the item the setup process could not be completed. It would repeatedly not connect to the internet. As I had time throughout the day on occasion, I would try and get it to work with the same problems. Frustrations continually mounted and I gave in and contacted customer service. They had the device's serial number listed with some other account and ""blacklisted"" (whatever that means). Hours, chats, and phone calls have exhausted much of my time and resolved nothing. Customer service says its a technical issue and the technicians say they can't do anything because I have the wrong serial number. That is an incorrect statement by Amazon because I am 100% sure I have the correct serial number and it was never completely set up , never reported lost, and never connected to internet successfully. The box is even still in my possession. They will not take the item back for exchange. They will not do anything to resolve the issue, they just want to send me in phone and chat circles which resolve nothing."	1	August 14, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I have been using the Google Home for over year now and I love that I can just say hey Google play the office hey Google turn down volume 20% it does commands incredibly well when I got the Alexa I figured I could use it out in my workshop where I have a big smart TV and it will not let me tell it to play something I honestly disconnected at it after an hour boxed it up and put it in storage	3	October 28, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I still don‚Äôt have it all connected since Len Barrie didn‚Äôt wire the ruckus box correctly. The amazon tech connected 2things  said to let him know when Lenard was done fixing it ,which I did but got no response and now have to wait till august 12. I have been trying to get this all connected since moving in the end of February. I know Covid has slowed things down but there are people the moved in well after I have and have been able to get appointments  much sooner than I have been able to. The customer service people don‚Äôt know what they are doing. Three different people gave me different info on how to book an appointment. Very disappointed with amazon and lennar	2	August 1, 2020	0
Echo Dot	It's nice to have a device that will instantly turn on music when asked for..but the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.  I guess getting an additional plug-in speaker (which is a lot more expensive than this unit)  is the answer since this small unit is hardly enough.	3	July 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Shuts off when playing music after awhile. Light ring is constantly going on, changing colors. Not sure what is happening.	2	February 20, 2022	0

Echo Dot	While Echo and Alexa will provide you with a vast amount of information and entertainment at no charge, before you purchase one you should understand that there are areas where you will asked to pay for information. As an example, you can get Echo to play music (e.g. classical) that Alexa chooses for you but if you want a specific composer or piece of music played, you must sign up for a music service at $3.99 a month.	3	December 15, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I like having alexa to control stuff, as I'm disabled and sometimes just getting up to walk is impossible. However, this particular model just doesn't last. ALL 3 of them that I have bought have stopped working in less than 6 months after I bought them. Of course, they do last long enough to be outside return window and warrantee, such as it is. Circling yellow light means death; nothing will bring it back, not even a full reset. I don't know if I should buy a more expensive Echo product or go with another brand all together. I don't have money to waste like this.****update****I bought a more expensive 4th gen dot, died in 5 months. Google??	1	January 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The volume is too soft then too loud. Not enough gradations. It also feels instrusive when I get requests asking me to review products although that seems to have stopped since I told Alexa I was not interested.	3	January 7, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"There's a yellowish-orangish ring that pops up from time to time without a command and it makes a ""clunk"" sound that I cannot figure out...I worry about privacy with this thing..."	3	April 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The sound on this little speaker is great to be as so tiny. Main issue is it is cause issues with my other devices that have Alexa. My TV plays music when the fire stick attached has not been Alexa enabled. The Spotify doesn't work on it. My son talking to his speaker two rooms away with doors closed causes other devices to respond. Not as accurate as they say.	3	February 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Ok	3	August 31, 2021	1

Echo Dot	Seems about as intelligent as a 5 Year old,  I couldn't believe how dumb it was,  30% of questions it didn't understand, and 70% of questions it answered totally wrongI'll stick with my laptop!	3	January 5, 2021	1
Echo Dot	the value for what you got, you can‚Äôt beat... when it was on sale. Biggest let down was the routines that it wasn‚Äôt doing at all. Have to delete them constantly and remake a routine just so it will do as I asked. Kind of a pain. The calling feature is a let down as well due to the fact that you can‚Äôt hear anything from the echo. Should‚Äôve added a feature to change the volume for different uses such as music, normal Alexa voice and video calling volume.	3	September 6, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"I enjoy the ease of using.  the circle of lights, which is supposed to indicate that it is ""on"" and ready to do something for me, is on almost all the time.  I had to unplug it, just to have it stop doing that.  Not sure why it is doing it or what it is up to, but, if it were on only upon voice command, it would be a whole lot better."	3	December 25, 2019	1

Echo Dot	Echo dot generation 3 that I purchased recently as a muffled sound to it it is not very clear I'm going to remove the phone rubber around the ring to see if it clears the sound up	3	January 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I have recently decided to get rid of these things because I find myself yelling at them more than they help.  The wrong one constantly answers, and it's next to impossible to get them to just turn off all the lights.. between unwanted notifications that make lights that won't go away to guard mode that tells you to disarm you disarmed alarm.. they are a constant source of annoyance i the home.  Everytime you ask the 'supposed smart speaker' to change something it tells you to go to the app to do it.. really?  It should be called a dumb speaker with lots of lights and a screen that won't go off if you have more than one.  When I first got these I got more than one I think that was the problem.. these devices will not bring you joy.  They will just add another device that won't do what you want it to in your house with lights that will wake you up when you just want a dark room.  Please don't buy these save yourself the headache.	1	November 27, 2020	0
Echo Dot	For such a small speaker it has good sound. Just that it does not always understand what I am saying and a few times I had to say the wake word more than once. For something that supposedly has four microphone that is a disappointment. Then a few times the speaker had a cracking sound, I just unplugged it ad plugged it back in and it was fine.	3	February 25, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"MetroPCS offered me this EchoDot for free. So, I got it. I feel like I should have went for the FireStick 4K now though. I dont have any other ""Smart Appliances"" in my home for her to control and I am just not well versed enough to be able to fully utilize the EchoDots skills, I assume. But, it's still kind of neat. Idk"	3	March 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I both the Echo Dot 3 to primarily control my Philips Hue lighting, but its not very intuitive and once I've memorized ""exactly"" how to ask Alexa to do something with success, the results are not repetitive.  It's also very glitchy.  Example, I can say ""Alexa turn on Arctic Aurora in the Kitchen"" and it has never worked.  Yet I can say ""Alexa turn on Arctic Aurora in the Master Bedroom or in the whole down stair house zone (which includes the Kitchen) and it will work just fine.  At this point it's still easier and faster for me to go into my Philips Hue app on my phone to control the lights, so I'm back burnering the Echo Dot 3 for now."	2	July 16, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I like to listen to whatever kind of music I am in the mood for thru Alexa however the speaker is muffled sounding.  Since Alexa doesn't have a separate speaker she does, however, have an auxiliary output as does an older speaker tower we have.  Voila!  it does work and sounds a bit better. Now I am using Alexa for more than just an expensive meal timer.	3	January 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I like that it plays music by command, but you really have to speak clearly and slowly. Tempermental.  Audio is not as clear as i had hoped and bass is not as strong as i would have liked.	3	December 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Its a great device, sounds better than a Google Home Mini but it is not able to distinguish sound nearly as well as the Mini. The test was having the TV on each device equal distance from the TV speaker, about 18"".Time after time the Mini was able to hear and process commands where the Echo failed nearly as much.The take away fro me is the Echo doesn't work well in a noisy environment."	3	December 17, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The 3rd generation Echo Dot looks nice, but the sound quality is a bit muffled, and isn't as clear as the prior generation. I also do not like the new plug. I like the universal USB mini plug that came with the 2nd generation Echo Dot. I have several of them and can swap the plug out and charge my phone, if needed.	3	March 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have several dots at home and purchased one for work. I get it all set up and BAM I cannot listen to Amazon Music at work, while my wife is listening to Amazon Music from home. The kicker is that I even have a subscription to Amazon Music Unlimited!  For these reasons I give Alexa integration one star.	3	April 29, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I like it as far as playing music and basic needs like checking the weather. However, it will not connect to my apple music nor will it do a lot of other things i tried to activate in the app. I love hearing my 2 year old try to talk to alexa, but i am highly considering returning.....	3	May 15, 2020	1

Echo Dot	While asking Alexa to do most things, I have to literally scream or repeat myself over and over. Sometimes she hears me and legit just doesn‚Äôt do anything. Waste of money in my opinion. If I were you, I would go with google home instead.	1	August 10, 2022	0
Echo Dot	One really annoying thing is that if it is connected to my fire tv, the sound only plays though the echo dot. In order for the sound to play through the TV, I have to disconnect the echo dot from my tv. Plus It picks and chooses when it wants to work with my TV. Also Alexa tends to not know answers to any questions. I do enjoy the music alarm option though.	3	January 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The main issue I have with Alexa is the sound reproduction. Returned the first one after installing a raise stand to place Echo Dot. I also trying having Alexa speak slowly. If I don't find a better solution, then maybe, just maybe I need a better System. I like the functions, but the quality of sould need great improvement. Alexa, good bye; muffled (good bye)...	3	March 10, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"New review: Alexa gets less intuitive by the week, more frustrating, and it will never have YouTube Music, so I'm over the Echo and Alexa.Not being able to play YouTube Music because they think it'll hurt their Amazon Music is not a good enough reason to screw people over. Way more users use YouTube Music than Amazon Music. It's a no-brainer: Amazon/Bezos won't let you listen to what you want and allows its employees to suffer under intense pressure. Sounds like a government.My Echos, of which I have five in a household of three people, have all gotten billegerent in their ripe old age of 6 months (for the newest three).They play the wrong song... almost always... turns off the wrong devices, ignores you even when you speak clearly, tells you something random instead of giving the ""I didn't catch that"" cue.Google Nests are now populating my house, and I in turn replaced my Fire TV devices with Roku.Original review:""Pretty much the Alexa device you've come to know with the Dot.Sometimes completely misheard what's said."""	1	November 10, 2020	0

Echo Dot	We have three in all and the other two work beautifully but this one wouldn‚Äôt set up at my daughters apt at college so she brought home and isn‚Äôt working like other two here either.

Echo Dot	I got two during Black Friday. One was $12! Cheaper than the other. Ok. Fine. But the one I got that was cheaper has far less issues. The first one I got, the black one, constantly cuts out, beeps and stops playing music. The other one does not do that. Thinking I should return it because it cannot be updated or settings adjusted enough to not make it the most annoying thing ever.	3	December 23, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I like that the products instant response to your query. What I don‚Äôt like is that it‚Äôs very limited in the information that it gives you. Like it should be connected directly to Google so that they can tell you or read your information that you ask about. should be able to play any song and give you reviews of any movie. the weather and time and alarm are all working Very well	3	January 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This is over hyped. I got it as a gift for my father for Christmas because he uses voice text and siri a lot on his phone. This is fairly limited in what we were expecting in features. He is not able to call or text though it like we were expecting, unless you wanted to contact another alexa product. Maybe with more time they will add more features.	3	February 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It is just ok. It took a long time to set up I ended up having to keep it right by my internet for it to connect.  I wanted to get 2 more for upstairs but now I'm skeptical because they may not connect. We have an excellent internet connection so that isn't the problems. I dont know.	3	May 1, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I ordered this to add to my previous echo 3, so I could use the multi speaker feature which I was super excited about but this speaker sounds blown out. I have to keep the volume low. Also after adding this speaker the 1st echo sometimes doesn't even work. If it does work then it's a huge delay. I'm a little disappointed especially because I am now paying for Amazon prime music.	3	January 13, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Hard setup, verry confusing. I thought i was done setting it up so I deleted the app and when i tried calling alexa,no reply. So i had to re download and start it all over. Beware of price drops on this product. Just 5days later after my purchase, you could get this for $1.99. Yes thats right and it was a promotion. So make sure your close to any ‚Äúholiday‚Äù to secure the lowest price.	1	May 19, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Very disappointed that if you own more than one echo dot speaker and locate them in different rooms, you cannot play music on them at the same time.  Purchasing (3) for different family  members was a waste of money due to that unfortunate factor.	3	September 19, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"Doesn't work with protected wifi management frames. Yikes. Can't change content volume separately from Alexa voice volume meaning nothing is ever an appropriate volume. Either music is too quiet or Alexa is shouting at you waking up your neighbors. Forgets volume setting overnight so she yells at you when you wake up. Not great for an apartment setup with paper thin walls or if you have anyone else living with you. iOS app freezes and falls out of sync constantly. Pretty dumb UX for a ""smart"" device."	3	September 5, 2019	1

Echo Dot	I bought this Alexa Puck as a gift for my daughter's birthday. She enjoyed Alexis quirkiness, the jokes, and information on demand. What you didn't enjoy was Alexis spontaneously dying without cause or the ability to reactivate.

Echo Dot	I enjoy the Echo Dot when it works, but it doesn't always listen.  First thing in the morning I'll ask it to play music.  The lights go on . . . and off with no results.

Echo Dot	El equipo como hardware, es impresionante, una excelente calidad de sonido y muy buen reconocimiento de voz. El problema es que el equipo se sincroniza muy poco con otros servicios que no son de Amazon.

Echo Dot	You cant plug your aux into this item and use it as an external, speaker bluetooth only. Apparently thats only for the bigger ones. Hey amazon, guess what... most gaming monitors dont have external speakers and dont have built in bluetooth.

Its not even a theory anymore.Pretty good sound quality though.	2	July 3, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Added this to other devices. The sound was okay. The device doesnt seem as responsive as my other devices. The music seems to suddenly stop or skip to the next song without completing what was playing.  Had I not had other Alexas, I might not have noticed these quirks. Perhaps because its new, it has to work its self out and get used to my voice and usual asks.	3	January 13, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Sound is much better than 1st generation. BUT it shuts down totally after 5 hours.  The first hours, I also have to keep telling her to play music.  That becomes annoying.

Echo Dot	Absolutely terrible. I intended to buy a google home and I got this instead by mistake. Decided to stick it out and set it up. Constantly disconnects from any other device I try to play sound from. Even with proper updates and restarting every device/ troubleshooting. Sometimes doesn‚Äôt play audio from laptop at all even when showing it‚Äôs connected. Constantly tunes in when not being spoken to. Doesn‚Äôt work without WiFi so make sure your WiFi is always on a reliable network. Doesn‚Äôt recognize many songs you ask it to play oh and you have to pay for an Amazon Music subscription if you want to play any song on Alexa without connecting a separate device to play audio from. Trash item. Get Google instead.	2	July 3, 2020	0

Echo Dot	As this 3rd generation echo dot is my first, I figured most of the kinks were fixed.  I've had problems  with the echo dot responding without me speaking loudly,  creating playlists, and controlling volume on a linked Sonos Play 1 speaker.

Echo Dot	I have 4 of these in my house which was purchased around the holidays, 6 months ago.  Just recently lost connection to two of these.  I add tried to reconnect multiple times, including rebooting my router.  Alexa app kept saying my I had the wrong password, when I know I did not change it.  Called tech support and they could not help. Just walked me through the same procedures that I had already done on my own.  And since my warranty expired, I could not get a replacement - just a measly 15% off for purchasing a new one.  Not so sure I want to pay more money to get the two I own replaced.  Not happy about these.	2	June 21, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"This is my 3rd one that has died. My current one has just been flashing orange for weeks. I have literally done everything Eben completely restarting it and adding it as a new device. It gets connected but then it still says it's offline and then the device tells me it is ""updating and will let me know when it's finished"" yea I doubt it takes WEEKS to update. I'm done with this garbage. When it works it's very convenient to have around but the problem is it hardly works"	1	March 12, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I'm learning to hate this thing. One I have to unplug it half the time to get it to stop playing spotify. It shows it hears me, it just doesnt do it. It has become more of a hassle than a help at this point. Plus, I got this because it said it pairs with the FireStick, but that's misleading. This is not really a speaker as a primary function, despite being called one. This is a mic with some speaker abilities. It can play music on command, it can make your lists and alarms and you can shop. However, you can not listen to what you're watching on your FireStick, despite pairing. It will only do exactly as it would on it's own. However the FireStick will connect to a bluetooth speaker. Your FireStick is already an Alexa Device, so a Bluetooth Speaker will be a lot more useful as a FireStick pairing. If you want the Dot as audio assistant, the Dot will be fine. If you just want to listen to news and music in each room, shop and spy on your kids convos when you're not in the same room, the Dot will work fine. As long as you dont mind unplugging it to turn it off. However, if you want it because it says it will work with the FireStick... meh.	1	November 22, 2019	0

Echo Dot	Its sound is not loud	3	July 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The app is hard to follow and not user-friendly. Will not stay connected to My  Internet even though I have full signal on my phone.  Not sure what the problem is possibly  sick of hearing I can‚Äôt understand you right now!  Try later .	3	August 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Seems in the drive to get improved music quality, there was a sacrifice of the range for spoken word. Music sounds better overall than on older alexas and dots that I own, but the clarity of speech is poor.	3	November 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Volume is inconsistent.  Responds in high volume for certain skills and low volume on other skills.  Sound is not as good as generation 2.	2	January 25, 2022	0
Echo Dot	You would think that Amazon would have perfected the speaker in the DOT by the 3rd generation! I use my full size Echos for music and the DOT strictly to control my Echo clock (very cool product btw) and soon my Amazon combo microwave/air fryer (hopefully) in the kitchen but forget about any type of quality sound. Muffled, bassy and just plain junk for a speaker. Hey Amazon, get together with BOSE and learn a lesson!	3	November 9, 2019	1
Echo Dot	My previous orders for this item were returned to the source by the transit system, no fault of yours or mine,; I never saw the items and had to order again.  the point is:  My first time order the product was 29.99...Why was it more expensive the second time?	3	June 30, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"We use the Echo for music.  Despite having voice purchasing turned off, the absolute MOST annoying problem is that Echo is constantly trying to push ""Amazon Unlimited music, free for 30 days, would you like to try now?"" (No) ""ok, you can sign up at any time simply by...""  AND IT GOES ON AND ON EVERY.SINGLE.TIME.  No means no, Echo.  We are ready to chuck the puck across the room.  Terrible, invasive user experience."	2	July 2, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"I don't like the heavy level of muffled voice of Alexa.  I think Alexa is an interesting toy.  I don't think there are enough critical ""devices"" that Alexa can/should control.  Alexa was a gift...I've had it on the kitchen table since Christmas.  But so far, Alexa can only update me with weather and news...that I get from television.  So...what's the big deal with Alexa?"	3	January 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This was a gift that someone gave to my daughter for Christmas. It worked really good for the first three weeks and then started skipping glitching and making odd noises and the only way to get it to stop is to unplug it for a few minutes and then plug it back in it‚Äôll be good for a couple days and then it‚Äôll start glitching again.	3	January 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have to say Echo more than once sometimes for it to recognize i‚Äôm speaking to it. I don‚Äôt think Alexa is very smart in terms of answering questions that I ask her. The sound quality is not that great and it does not get as loud as I would like for it to. The Alexa app that goes with the Echo Dot is a little difficult to navigate.	3	January 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It works great and always recognizes my voice even when I speak softly. The only issue I‚Äôve had has been connection to the the Alexa through the app. Also my Alexa disconnects from the WiFi constantly. I‚Äôll be able to connect to the Alexa fine for about an hour before the connecting is disrupted. My WiFi works fine but the Alexa will somehow lose signal.	3	February 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Este es un dispositivo muy bueno, pero requiere una mejora en cuanto a su uso en Colombia con el lenguaje espa√±ol, el reconocimiento de voz sufre muchas fallas, no cuenta con muchas skills para uso dentro de Colombia, le falta mucho	3	October 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The speaker is good, but as far as I‚Äôm concerned, the jury is still out on this technology. Shortly after we got this, my kids were talking with something that said it was artificial intelligence. I often unplug it as it freaks me out, and is always listening. Most people seem fine with it; I might not keep it. But again, the speaker itself is good quality.	3	January 20, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I dont understand why i cant connect youtube music to this speaker	3	June 15, 2021	1
Echo Dot	One day I‚Äôll tell her to play something the next day I tell her the exact same thing and she start playing other stuff even though I try multiple times she still play something else completely different from what I tell her. Sound quality is descent for the size. I do like the fact that I can tell her to lower or rise the volume without having to go to her or look for a remote.	3	November 10, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I got the dot and it works as described but I find that it can answer only simple questions such as what is the weather.  For more complex questions it will either go on a long explanation or say it knows nothing on that.  It is great for music, weather, simple requests.  The longer answers are a little difficult to listen to, the voice is a little muttled.	3	December 20, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Cons:  1.  Very difficult to set up.  There are so many apps that are either related to Alexa or pretend to be Alexa that it's easy to be misled.  The instructions over simplify the process. 2. Integration with other devices is not easy and normally requires you purchase additional interface equipment/bridges . 3.  What it can do without purchasing subscriptions is very disappointingPro:  It recognizes my voice and 75% of my requests, when its working	3	September 20, 2019	1
Echo Dot	great sound quality and really loud. not the greatest of course. It has a premium feel to it and isnt that heavy which is great for travel. only downside is that it doesnt connect to my wifi because of the router but i just connect via bluetooth and use the alexa app to summon	3	May 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"It's a great product if it wasn't for the fact it'll keep signing you up to Amazon Music Unlimited even when you tell it ""NO"".  This has happened twice so far.  We have had to stop all voice purchases to fix the problem.  It's annoying and it reduces the products function."	3	May 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The voice recognition is good, and very basic commands are handled easily (ie.what is the temperature now; play X song etc.). The speaker is poor though, and difficult to hear, so rarely seem to want to use the echo dot.	3	October 29, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Standard BT speaker, nothing fancy. Limited options to choose from, no connecting to WiFi without a password, they want full access to your surroundings in order to use this.... sorry but I‚Äôm not willing to let someone snoop on me (yes, they actually do listen in on your conversations even if you aren‚Äôt asking alexa something) they say it‚Äôs to help evolve the product but yet google and Apple don‚Äôt have such requirements. Anyhow if you don‚Äôt care much about that and just want a cheap BT this would work, just unplug it once you‚Äôre done using it. I won‚Äôt let amazon use my info without my permission and they don‚Äôt even pay us for our info. That‚Äôs not right. Our information is the worth millions and millions of dollars and they don‚Äôt even pay us for it.	2	March 3, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I suppose of you're dialed in to all of the Amazon bells & whistles this might be great. I am not and I find it of not much use. I can barely understand what she says though she seems to understand me. The only thing I really use it for at this point is to connect to my local NPR station. I've connected it to another set of speakers for better sound.	3	December 10, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Alexa has trouble hearing and understanding every request. There are songs and requests she just misses or doesn't understand she can also just not hear you say her name. But that's ok, she's good for what she can do.	3	November 11, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I love the voice recognition and the skills, hoping the devs can fix the issue with the echo not playing music from any skill after the daily crash.

Echo Dot	I would‚Äôve given this thing 5 stars.... however, disappointed in how you have to power it.The power source is huge and takes up a lot of space. Totally regret buying this. I would‚Äôve returned it but my gf threw out the box. So I‚Äôm stuck with it.Also, now you can no longer use micro usb cable to charge it, which is a bummer.Also, you have to get a specific color for it to show you the time. Hopefully they come out with new colors. I thought the color I purchased has the clock on it... but sadly it did not.I own a gen 2 echo dot and think that one was superior to this latest gen. I think the sound on this one is a bit better but I don‚Äôt use it so much for music.	2	January 13, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I wanted to use this with my Echo Show as an intercom. But it doesn't work. When I ask the Echo Show to drop in on the dot, it says it can't do that. Is the Echo Show trying to display an image via the dot?  It seems like the 2 devices don't play well together. I am not happy with the dot.	3	February 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It wasn‚Äôt something I went looking for, but was part of a package service. My kids seem more excited about it than I was and their excitement quickly evaporated once they realized that their iPads and other electronics basically do the same thing.About the only thing I was remotely interested in was morning news updates, but you have to purchase all sorts of additional access to get more variety than the three or four new sources they offer which appear to lean heavily in one direction only and I prefer multiple news sources.	2	February 18, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"When I have a specific question, Alexa is often unable to supply an answer so I end up using Google Chrome which is what I was doing before the Echo dot. I look at the Echo about like I look at Pong and Pac Man. It is a start to better AI but has a loooong way to go. Ask Alexa the distance from one city to another and you get the direct distance stated  ""as the crow flies"" . How many crows own an Echo for God's sake? Bezos needs to hire better talent that lives in the real world. I'm looking at buying a Google nest mini for comparison."	2	September 29, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Had a hard time uncoupling from 1 Bluetooth speaker to move to another.  Now it doesn‚Äôt work at all and it‚Äôs not even 2 months old.Customer service was very helpful and determined Alexa needed a software update.  Apparently we are supposed to tell it that.	3	July 11, 2020	1

Echo Dot	This is a grate helper when it comes to turn on/off things like lights lock doors etc. But sometimes is not too smart. Also when it integrate with speakers you can only chose one to play the music not both. Regardless off anything it is a really well done product.	3	June 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Works just as the description. Speaker is loud and clear. Two Alexas can not play at the same time in different rooms.

Have you ever said to yourself, ""gee if only there were some device that would tell me its updating, just to do nothing at all, without telling you it's actually not updating? Have you ever wanted to spend a long time trying and failing to set up a device because it just gives you a spinning orange ring? Then the 3rd gen echo dot is for you!

Echo Dot	It is plenty loud but I had to repeat myself more than twice at times for it to recognize that I was talking to it.

Echo Dot	It doesn‚Äôt do all that I thought it would do. I‚Äôve even been reading the emails that provides statement ideas and half of those do not work.

It‚Äôs easier than pulling it up on my phone.	3	January 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I don't what people are talking about in reviews: the sound quality on this thing is horrendous.  It sounds like the audio coming out of a smartphone that has a pillow laying on it; super flat sound, little bass.  People say ""great quality sound for the size"" but this doesn't make sense as surround sound speakers blow this thing away and are often smaller.If you are thinking about buying this to use for music, see if you can find someone who has one and give it a real-world test.  If I didn't get this on super-sale, I would be returning. Not impressed.It may be fine for you if you don't care about music quality and use it mainly for the voice control functions, but I have no interest in that, so my review is coming from that perspective."	2	December 18, 2019	0
Echo Dot	This was an add-on for an existing echo dot in the house. I wanted to link up another room and haven't had a smooth connection with the new one. It's biggest problems are music playback unexpectedly stopping (and sometimes re-starting) and inability to connect to my other echo dot. It's alright...I just thought it would work better and be easier to set up.	3	February 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Never thought I'd use it..But gave it a try...It hardly understands you from 4ft60% of the time  u talk to Alexa..it becomes embarrassment if somebody watching or listening to you battling with Alexa to understand what u saying..Need improvement definitely...Turning off n on ights and fan can also become a messy situation,specially at night..when everybody is sleeping n u whisper the command..	3	December 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The music is why I went for the deal and I am sad I did. The music is beyond limited and repetitive. I am a professional musician for over 40 years and for my style of music, rock and roll is not good. If you like other genres maybe it is better.The Dot has terrible sound, very weak speaker, low volume otherwise it sounds bad. I had Google before and they seem very comparable and easy to use.I got the email offering the echo Dot for a low price and free prime music, they billed me for the month of music. Trying to contact Amazon and complain is beyond impossible, makes you really want to make darn sure yo are buying something from them you want. I tried the music for just over 2 weeks before I got frustrated and cancelled it. Tried contacting them to see about a refund and that is no happening.	1	May 18, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The sound level is to low and hard to understand.Only works with my new Samsung smart tv sometimes!Has issues working with my Honeywell Lryic thermostat!Won't tell me if my door is locked or unlocked!I have tried setting everything up several times and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.

Echo Dot	When I first bought it, it was great and very convenient. However, as a few months have passed, I have seen how the device doesn't respond most of the time and I have to scream at it which is really annoying. When I set alarms, they do not go off anymore, and it doesn't recognize simple words when I ask Alexa to play a song, it simply is more of a nuisance. The sound has become static-like and I cannot get it to connect to my laptop through Bluetooth at all. I haven't dropped it, spilled anything on it, it just doesn't perform well and I have only had it for a few months. Very disappointed.	2	August 13, 2020	0

Echo Dot	Sounds better than previous version, still mono though. Like that it has bluetooth and aux output which I use to hook up to another speaker.  I use Bluetooth to control music via phone and use apps not supported through dot.  Biggest problem is the new proprietary plug and cord, old model had micro USB power source which made compatibility and replacement so easy.  New plug is big and takes up a lot of room on power strip and if needs replacement will not be able to be replaced with micro USB cord and any old phone charger which is a money grab by Amazon.UPDATE:  Speaker can't handle low frequency at medium volume levels causing distortion	2	July 7, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I loved my echo dots, I have 2 of them.  Once my internet was upgraded, I couldn't get them to connect.  I spent 1 hour on the phone with Amazon, and they were not helpful at all.

Echo Dot	I guess I should not have expected much for such a small unit. But I actually thought it was going to be a little bigger than it is.

Echo Dot	It is not just this product but the entire line is showing to be unreliable. I am times have to be within inches and yelling to make it stop or start something. Keeps going offline and just a number of other issues.  I also have its competitor in the same room and while not perfect it is far more reliable and able to answer adult questions better.  The Amazon devices answers frequently the question it wants to answer and not what I asked. And yes, I have had Amazon support on the line so I could demonstrate this. The device did not let me down and messed up so support could hear it too.	2	August 7, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Was OK while it continued to work, but it died after a little over two years.  Did get a 15% discount on a new device, but for something that was totally electronic, I would have expected a longer live span.  I am typing this on a computer that is almost  20 years old and it is still working fine.Added 3-1-2020:After several weeks of not working - would occasionally flash some lights - but no sounds - we got the replacement echo and discovered that the original one had to remain plugged in in order for the next one to work properly.  Then out of the blue the original one resurrected itself and started working again.  AZ - you need a decent manual supplied with these devices and BETTER CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!!!!!!	2	February 14, 2020	0
Echo Dot	My primary purpose for my Dots was to provide background music in my family room.  I bought two and set them up to provide stereo music.  The musical sound quality is muddy and lacks definition.  Adjusting the EQ didn‚Äôt help much.  While the Alexa features work fine, overall sound performance is poor.  For me, they are unusable for music. I will be trying out the Apple small version Home Pods when they are available.  I bought the Dots on Prime Day so I have under $40 invested in the pair, so maybe my expectations were too high.	2	November 24, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Took way too long to arrive, but it arrived in good condition	3	June 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I like the simplicity of just asking out loud verses turning on multiple devices. Problem is a lot of the things I wanted to make easier require multiple subscriptions to various other services - like Amazon Music, etc. For the few things it will do for free, it's alright. I got it on sale so I am ok with what I paid for it verses what it can do for free.	3	November 17, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"Most of the time when I ask Alexa a simple question like ""what's the weather outside"", she'll answer the question and then say ""by the way..."" and then advertise one of her features to me. It's infuriating, and there's no way to turn these spam messages off. It's been like this for at least a year I think. I'm planning on getting rid of all of my Alexa devices and replacing them with Google devices because of this issue."	1	April 12, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Well let's start off by telling you how many devices I have. Two shows 5 in, 8 in & three dots. I really truly truly wanted I love this device actually I do but man does it have problems. loses connectivity with Spotify, when you speak to it, it doesn't answer or tells you something else, constantly having little issues. Oh I have the sub which works great.	3	December 13, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Sometimes I have to yell at the device to wake it back up. When it answers it works fine. But leave it alone for a day by itself and it acts just like my teenage boy.Basically over time it‚Äôs response and wake up diminishes. I wonder if a reboot or clearing on its buffer more frequently would solve its issues.	3	February 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	She never know who I am(tried to reset regonizer a lot of times), she don't know how to do a lot of easy functions. When I changed the cellphone I had to all devices again because they didn't linked with amazon on the phone. And if you change the language, there's a lot of bugs and routine doesn't work. But in general it's a good device.	3	December 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I received this echo dot with a lifx bulb. I took near forever to get the light to work even the slightest. Amazon responded that this was a known issue with the LIFX products. Currently still connecting and then going offline for long periods of time. The dot also will respond back with questions but is the only dot of my 3 that I cannot locate on bluetooth when trying to play through phone. - It also is programed in my alexa app and apart of a group but with the bluetooth issue, will not play 'everywhere'. Idk... love alexa products but this one was sketch	2	October 28, 2020	0
Echo Dot	These alexa's are not smart don't under stand anything and just want to sell you stuff what a joke I can get information faster looking it up myself	2	January 1, 2022	0
Echo Dot	For some reason the sound on this DOT is somewhat muffled.  Alexa‚Äôs voice especially, but also other sound - voices on radio stations, etc.  increasing volume does not help - only makes it more muffled.	3	November 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The google home is better. It sounds better and has better responses.	3	June 5, 2021	1
Echo Dot	What use is a smart speaker that is constantly offline and unresponsive?  None.  The fact that I know the problem is my router... but that I have also tried 3 different ones with no change in behavior, all with updated firmware, tells me that basically Echoes do not work reliably with routers older than a year or so at this point.  All of the people I know that have them and do not have this issue have brand-spanking-new, high-end routers.  Well, I can't afford that right now, so instead I have to set mine up again weekly if not more often.Moral:  Don't get one if you don't have the absolute-latest-and-greatest WiFi.  That your other devices have no issues is no assurance that Echoes won't.  Their wifi connectivity absolutely stinks for such an expensive device.	2	December 19, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Very difficult to setup with smart home devices. For some reason it duplicates devices which causes issues with the voice commands. Still hasn‚Äôt been able to connect to my nest thermostat even after a week of using it. Sound quality isn‚Äôt very good for music compared to most Bluetooth speakers. It seems like the voice recognition is good but it has trouble turning that into usable commands for devices. Overall I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Alexa or Echo devices to anyone and don‚Äôt understand the hype with devices like this especially with the massive privacy issues.	2	February 3, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I had a great experience with this smart device, I even bought plugs and lights to go along with it. But just recently it has decided not to function. I have tried everything I could and it just doesn't work anymore. It's only been a couple of months since I had it, I won't be buying one of these ever again now. Just be careful that it may just stop working eventually.	2	August 5, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I love my Alexa Dot but did not receive the second one of the 2 for $39.99 as a Prime member. i wanted to do  stereo. What happened? I tried two times and it wont take the code. Bummer.	3	October 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	We ended up returning this item before we really used it. We dis not realize it is NOT wireless and would beed to be plugged in. We were looking for wireless.	3	January 16, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It is loud! But it is sooo muffled when Alexa speaks. Yes I messed with the Equilizer on the Alexa app but it didn't fix the charlie brown parents voice that comes out of Alexa when she speaks.	3	October 26, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It has trouble connecting and keeping connected to WiFi even if any of my other devices have no issue picking it up. With Amazon music it would stop playing a song and then either start over or switch to another one. I have good internet connection, so I'm not sure why. I'd even turn some devices off so it could have a stronger signal. Same thing happened.	3	December 17, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I bought this for my wife but she didn't like it.  I started using it but it seems to have trouble with voice recognition.  It wont increase or lower the volume and when I ask it to play music from my spotify, it will go to spotify but it plays some random music.  I will say the sound quality is great!	3	January 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I lived it when I hooked it up and used it. 3days ago.  Right this moment trying to use it and it won‚Äôt work. Says, not connected to internet. So I try to hook it all back up and now it doesn‚Äôt work. So 3days I had it hooked up and used it one day.  Waiting to hear back for some help.üôÅ not happy at all.	3	December 9, 2019	1

Echo Dot	It works just like it said - i don't like the idea of having to link it to my cell phone - i don't mind the internet - but giving permission for my personal stuff is not your have to so you can invade my privacy.

Echo Dot	It is just a piece of junk. Does not understand ANY of my questions and and surely does not have any music for my favorite genre. Alexa gives very unrelated answers...same with music, ask for Nordic song and she'll play some unrelated crap . To use this thing very frustrating.You cannot simply Bluetooth music from your phone...no no no, you have to download the stupid app and then turn on Bluetooth in Alexa....ii used to use the google mini to locate my phone, no app needed. I totally regret switching! I advice you to rethink this purchase!	1	February 7, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I have a problem with this item.  The lights keep on going and do not shut off.  The first time it happened I disconnected and then started it up again and that worked but since that first time, the lights keep on flashing.  Also, one day while nothing was on, I heard the echo reading a book.  I was surprised as I did not request this.  Is there a problem with this particular echo?	3	September 5, 2019	1

Echo Dot	We went out shopping and before leaving we turned off everything in the house.  We had not used Echo Dot in several days.  When we returned  the Echo Dot was playing Christmas Music.

Echo Dot	"It sometimes go off line, or is hard to recognize my voice...also some of the songs it can't find sometimes and sometimes it does.-my dislikesIt's easy, convenient and kid accessible.

Echo Dot	from Christmas day until now march 12 2022 this thing has did just like it wanted to it doesn't take commands it will not play music even if you have the music subscription my daughter gave up on it a few times and i tried to send it back but they refuse to take it back the order ticket says it's eligible for return until November 2022 Amazon my patience is running out with y'all i won't order again i should cancel my order i made today	1	March 13, 2022	0

Echo Dot	The new ones don't seem as sensitive as past generations. Now that I have 4 echo devices in different rooms, it seems like things are worse, not better. I like having music in each room, but Alexa often seems confused by what I'm saying and where I'm saying it.	3	June 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The only things that I don't like about this device is that the speaker is not loud at all, the quality of the bass is very low, and it only plays music from Amazon music or from a music app that you have subscribed to such as Spotify. If you want to play the music that's saved on your phone or from YouTube, you would have to use the device as a bluetooth. This device didn't fit the needs that I was looking for.	2	April 20, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Don't know why there's 2 version of this,  one without the clock & one with it? Thats honestly the most stupid idea ever like who in Amozon approved this üòÇ should of just add a off and on feature not create 2 separate version but whats done is done üëè	3	May 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa seems to be getting worse and worse at voice recognition. Half the time we can't get the Fire TV to pause using Alexa and it's all but useless for searching things. Getting Alexa to turn on smart plus is also becoming more and more difficult. Alexa will turn the plug on, but won't turn it off saying there's no device with that name. That's literally just after using Alexa to turn the device on. We used to use Alexa a good bit, but we've all but given up most of the time. The only thing the Echo has going for it is good sound. That's not all that useful if you can't get Alexa to recognize what you're wanting it to do though. We use our Google Home Mini speakers far more often now.	2	February 2, 2020	0

Echo Dot	Echo Dot. Worth the money. I wake up and tell her what I want to hear. Still building more skills. It does seem geared more for families than an individual. I have a list of what can be done to improve it for everyone but I don‚Äôt get paid to do that or even review things. But this is a cool product.	3	January 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I use it as a speaker for my fire stick and even when is set to the highest volume you can barely hear it	3	April 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Our echo dot was purchased as a gift.  As such, it was registered under a different account than the one used to order the device.  Unfortunately, this means the free Music Unlimited subscription is not accessible.  It'd be great if Amazon could provide a way to transfer the subscription.  I imagine we're not the only ones who have encountered this problem.	3	December 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"Where to start? It's unintuitive & does virtually nothing helpful outside of give the forecast, it talks to us when we've said nothing resembling ""Alexa"", and despite opting for the say-less option in the app, this stupid thing still adds ""By the way, ____"" half the time after one simple command, even when I WHISPER. Alexa. People are sleeping. I do not want to learn your other features when you're not good at the ones you're supposed to be.At best, it's a timer that may or may not work. At worst it's a privacy invading, inferior product and it's been created just for our smoothbrained generation who's so quickly welcomed an exchange of their privacy for instant gratification."	1	December 24, 2021	0

Echo Dot	We like our Alexa, we just have had a few problems with her not understanding, and not knowing a lot of things.

The music with Amazon music is great, and she works well for that.	3	December 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I was someone who preordered Echo when it was first offered...and have enjoyed it for years....I decide to get the Dot for bluetooth ....the price of $39 was terrific and I bought some as gifts...But I sent the first one back and have re calibrated the sound several times  ....I can still listen to upbeat music but mellow music is horrible...garbled... I can't even understand  Alexa when she answers me and forget podcasts....at least it's small  and I can check the weather and make an emergency callVery disappointed	1	February 8, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Its a dot, works like a dot for the most part. The only thing is that it doesn't recognize all of the same voice commands i have setup for my house lights etc. I've checked and rechecked the setup and the other 2 2nd gen dots I have work with no issues.

Echo Dot	The Echo Dot 3 is the first time for me using the Alexa app.  The quality of the Dot is very good.  It works well and was easy for me to learn how to use.The only drawback is that you have to plug it into an AC outlet to use.  Therefore it's not useful in automobiles which are not equipped with an AC outlet.	3	November 17, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"I've had echo devices throughout my house for years but the last few months have been torture with this thing.

Echo Dot	Besides buying the Echo, I bought 2 Echo Dots so we could use them as intercoms.  Once connected between two rooms, the volume stays at the same level, so we can barely hear each other - if we boost the volume for this, it could blow our ears out for other things, like music being played in that room.  Good concept, average execution...	3	December 12, 2019	1

Echo Dot	I love the echo's capability to network with all other Alexa/Echo devices. It is fun to utilize. My only gripe is the sound quality.

Echo Dot	This is a wonderful option if you are on a budget and looking for an affordable speaker with voice recognition. Unfortunately if you have Apple Music it does not work well. You aren‚Äôt able to select songs directly from the Apple Music app to play through the Echo Dot. The Alexa app chooses songs for you at random and they could or could not be songs that are saved to your library. I hope in the future that it will be allowed for you to play songs directly from Apple Music.	1	February 19, 2022	0
Echo Dot	We have several Echo devices (Dots & Shows) & enjoy using Alexa for several functions in our house.  Our primary complaint with all of them is their poor sound quality.

Echo Dot	We recieved this as a Christmas gift and I know we won't take advantage of all its capabilities but we are hooked on playing music, inquiring about the weather and oh those jokes.

Echo Dot	This generation of Echo Dot is sleek looking, but the sound quality isn't nearly as good as my 2nd generation.  Alexa sounds as if she is speaking through a wool scarf.  It is difficult to tell if she is saying 32 degrees or 42 degrees.  I enjoy using my Alexa, but am disappointed with the sound quality.	3	January 15, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It not quite as easy to setup, use or available connections to devices as Google mini. I would definitely recommend the Google mini over this every time. And yes I use fire TV devices, which is y I wanted to try the dot, but I couldn't quite figure out to connect the 2. At least not without a popular streaming service.	3	January 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The description says the dot3 will control smart LED lights which it can, but not without the addition of a smart hub which costs more than the Alexa its self. Overall I am happy with the dot3 but would have liked knowing ahead of time that an additional hub would be required. The only workaround for this I found is to purchase bulbs that don't need a hub (roughly $24 per bulb) or buy the $150 Alexa with zigbee built in.	3	July 20, 2019	1
Echo Dot	As a cheap entry to voice-control, this is fine; it‚Äôs not going to hear a command across a noisy room like HomePod will, and it can‚Äôt keep a half-dozen voices separate to avoid your child shouting ‚Äúbaby shark‚Äù from corrupting your ‚Äúturn down volume‚Äù command.  I find anything over half volume, I‚Äôm standing inches from it screaming to get the command recognized ‚Äî so it doesn‚Äôt seem to noise-cancel itself from the audio input.  ..so it‚Äôs no HomePod, and can make all voice-assistants seem crappy, but if mediocre is Ok (and you don‚Äôt care about privacy) then this is fine.I‚Äôm going to upscale to the HomePod: I‚Äôm a bit tired of the words spoken into this device showing up as suggested things to buy, when it actually understands me.	2	February 2, 2020	0
Echo Dot	l like everything about it but the way it stops working, sometimes it last for 2 to 3 hours sometimes more. When it stops working there's nothing you can do but wait, and the wait vary's from time to time. l also thought it was supposed to answer my cell phone that its set up by but it doesn't, and it doesn't even mute just keeps playing the music.	3	October 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	They made it use a different power supply, because the 2nd generation was being used everywhere. I don't think its as good at voice recognition, but it sounds little better. Having stereo is nice, there's two 3rd gens in the room now.  There's not a lot more to say, everyone has one of these things. Alexa gets better, sometimes it amazes but most of the time it annoys.  Lower your expectations.	3	September 21, 2019	1

Echo Dot	The ONLY reason I'm giving this review 2 stars is because when I first got my echo everything was GREAT! SO fast forward to 7 months later my device does not respond to my requests. It'll light up but then do nothing. I've searched the internet and even the echo forum to hopefully fix the problem myself. I've had no luck, and in addition actually found that this is a FREQUENT problem with the echo dot! It's frustrating trying to get it to work with no success....	2	February 23, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Even after saying ‚ÄúAlexa turn off‚Äù it still lights up here and there listening to what you‚Äôre saying even when you don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù (Invading privacy). Honestly I could do with just my iPhone. Since in my opinion, This is another form to make unnecessary money (thankfully I didn‚Äôt buy it for myself). But they charge you monthly to play music that you can get free from YouTube. Also, it‚Äôs not wireless; it comes with a short cord. Other than that just get a regular speaker and use your smartphone to Bluetooth or set alarms & ask Siri (she‚Äôs free)	2	November 5, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I have had both the Echo and Google Home Mini and the Google Home Mini is better by a landslide. The ONLY redeeming factor the echo has over the Google Mini is the speaker volume. The Google Mini still managed to have better base and audio quality. Echo answers questions like a toddler and rarely understands simple words and sentences I say to her. It's a pain to connect it to my other devices and when I do it only works sometimes. Do yourself a favor and get a Google Home of any sort over an Alexa.	1	February 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Voice recognition I don't like.  A commercial was on TV and said Alexa and my echo was responding. Stupid for me to set up my voice and it recognized what's on TV.	3	November 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Most of the songs that I request she can't play without a paid subscription.  When having set a wake up alarm it won't raise the volumn to ensure the alarm song is heard.	3	November 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	When the dot is working, it is great, however it tends to go off-line or get lost in the netherworld and quits responding without any type of warning or alerts. When you try to control it from the app when it quits responding, it‚Äôs basically useless. I have to unplug it and let it reset and then I can begin using it again.	2	August 19, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"I wouldn't buy this, it came ""free"" as part of a deal with security cameras and couldn't be unbundled.  I figured it would make a good additonal portable speaker even though I wouldn't compromise my privacy by using Alexa and I am not lazy so can still use switches, appliances or keyboards instead of repeatedly screaming clarifying commands at a box. First, it doesn't use a usb plug and the base of the plug is so big it blocks the other receptacles on outlets. It is also heavy and falls out. There is no power button, so you must unplug it to turn it off. You will want to turn it off as it emits a big lit ring that is bright enough to bother you at night. Lastly, the sound quality is mediocre."	2	January 5, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I traded in one for the another because it will not understand me. I still have the same issue. Then if it does come on it will not turn off when I asked it to.

Echo Dot	I like the ease of setting it up. My main issue is I have to keep updating my WiFi for my voice commands to work almost every other day...it‚Äôs annoyingly, if that didn‚Äôt happen I could give it at 4 outta 5.

Echo Dot	Short and sweet review:Everything about the Dot is great except the sound quality for music. Sound quality for music is really poor like it was an unimportant afterthought. The sound is muddy, unclear and uncrisp...as though the speaker diaphragm is made of brown paper bag material.This poor sound quality certainly doesn't motivate me to invest in a more expensive version of the Echo.	3	November 2, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Just a little confused as to why I hear ads when I have her play songs through my spotify premium account and she also has trouble playing the songs I request her to play even though I ask her a handful of different ways to play a particular song.

Echo Dot	"Echo dot 3rd Gen sound is much better than 2nd Gen, but ""listening"" is not... you have to talk louder to get a response. Also, when playing songs from Amazon Music, it jumps from one to another before ending (and the song is not a sample, for sure... I've made a test). Do not recommend. Buy the 2nd Gen."	3	January 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Can't get it to chime when my Ring doorbell is activated--the only reason we bought it. It pairs with it and says it's connected but when we test it, NOTHING!  We went through all the correct steps for notifications, etc.And when I try to get help using their app or website, it never submits my inquiry and doesn't tell me what's wrong with it. Super frustrating and I have boxed it back up.  I will likely remove the Ring doorbell, too since only I or my husband can hear the chime (we don't allow the kids to have smart phones).	1	January 12, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I think the one i received was used because spesker sounds like a blown speaker crackling noise bad when you turn it up just a 1/5 of the way. Will probably send back for replacement	3	October 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Voice Recognition, integration all that was fine however, the sound quality sounds like those old 1970‚Äôs clock radio speakers. The sound quality is so poor Especially when you turn up the volume it seems to get worse. It‚Äôs to the point where you almost had enough to turn it down so it could sound halfway decent. Amazon, do whatever you need to do the step that part up because it‚Äôs strong enough for an Adult but, more suitable for an infant in his or her room and you want to play them a lullaby that doesn‚Äôt get too loud that‚Äôs just enough power to put that child to sleep....that‚Äôs what the dot is to me.....	2	June 25, 2020	0

Echo Dot	Descent little speaker.  I unplugged it within minutes of setting it up and put it back in the box after quickly realizing none of my home automation devices is compatible with it so the Echo Dot is basically useless in my home. The Echo Dot was free with my one year purchase of Sirius XM subscription so I can‚Äôt complain about the price. If you have multiple Alex compatible devices it would be much more useful.	2	April 30, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I bought 3 of these and use them in my home and office. The primary reason I bought it was to use it to stream music. It is choppy, cuts out and is infuriating when trying to stream with Spotify. This is the main reason I own these devices and I have spent/wasted too much time trying to fix what seems to be a VERY common problem. Do NOT buy if you are using it for this reason. I have no problem with the Amazon Show. Go that route if you can.	2	January 1, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Though sleek looking, I found Alexa to be cumbersome to setup. It also allows my kids to order apps through it without my consent which I don't like.  I use it primarily for white noise for the kiddos to sleep at night but some times it randomly turns off in the middle of the night.  I also don't like how it lights up when I'm just in the room talking.  I'm assuming it could be recording things I'm saying  which just feels weird to me.	2	January 18, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"I had a google speaker that was super helpful, but when I saw that Echo Dots were on sale, I bought 3. I went ALL in. Got them, hooked them up, downloaded the app and the issues began. I bought my mother a speaker for the AUX capability - never worked. Looking online you can deregister the speaker 3x and try it again but it has yet to work. My son has a blast with his, asking it stupid questions, but the Spotify app is spotty. You can't control it from Alexa and Alex doesn't always recognize what is being asked. He asks for a specific kid friendly pod cast, specifies the name of the show and says ""podcast"" after it, but it plays some raucous trap music that while I respect, isn't good for a child to hear.The only perks have been routines and keeping kids occupied. The speakers functionality is better suited for kids. I'm sending mine back and I may go back to google or anker has some amazing wireless speakers."	1	October 22, 2020	0

Echo Dot	My sole purpose of getting the echo dots was so I can use them to control my firesticks. After numerous attempts this appears to not be possible.

Echo Dot	I love the Echo dot.  We have several in various rooms.  However this echo dot sounds muffled and is hard to hear.

Kind of annoying.	3	February 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I was super psyched up to receive the Echo Dot, I got a great deal on it and wanted it to compete head-to-head with my Google Home setup. However, from the first moment forward I had nothing but trouble.First, you cannot assign a static IP to the Echo Dot. This meant I had to add an additional lease in my router for it to connect. Then, once I got it up and running, it would wake up with the wake word, but listen and listen, and never respond to what I say. Amazon admitted that it was a bug with that specific device, and I was sent a replacement. However, when the replacement arrived, it has an internal power failure and could never actually boot. Which put me in a stuck situation, because I already used my warranty service on the first one, even though I have two duds. The reason I gave sound quality 4 stars is I can cast music and audio to the Dot, I just can't talk to it.Long story short, I'm sure the device is great, but quality control failed me twice in a row.	1	May 18, 2020	0

Echo Dot	If you are buying this hoping to use for a sound machine, don't. Its inconsistent about how long it plays. Sometimes it plays for 12 hours. Sometimes only 1.

Third, did I say this is a hunk of junk?

Echo Dot	Do not get Alexa to play music, honestly it‚Äôs the most annoying device I have when it comes to music. It constantly says it doesn‚Äôt recognize something and you have to word for word tell it how to find something if you don‚Äôt have Amazon music. Maybe better if they found a way to intergrate Apple Music onto the software but since they want to advertise Amazon‚Äôs streaming service, anything outside of the ‚ÄúFree‚Äù is hard to access with Apple Music library, what‚Äôs the use of linking the services if you don‚Äôt make it a tangible option?	2	November 1, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"I purchased 3 Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gen to use as an intercom and for entertainment around my home and I noticed immediately the Echo Dot has severe Wi-Fi COMPATIBILITY issues that are not so beyond average consumers:1) Wi-Fi support is advertised as 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz connectivity however the dot will not see 'AC' networks that I have set up. The 2.4 Ghz network still inadequate even though signal strength reports FULL. Checking Wi-Fi signal strength from the access point shows that the Echo Dot 3rd Gen has a signal quality of above 80% and even comparing superior, similar, and inferior devices with much lower signal strength and a much higher SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) the Echo Dot is guaranteed to have issues. I am so astonished by the design of something that can't even stay connected as well as something with batteries!2) The Echo Dot 3rd Generation does not have a ""built-in"" battery for a  ""lightweight speaker"" and using the Alexa app for ""setting it up"" becomes a routine nuisance. It would be much better if voice prompts could be eliminated altogether and ""maybe if it just had lights""... must be the ULTRA COOL THERMODYNAMIC DESIGNIt can definitely keep your beer cold!"	1	September 4, 2019	0

Echo Dot	Alexa doesn‚Äôt respond verbally at the end of the timer which is really annoying when one has to set another timer or else the pasta or anything else would be spoiled.	3	November 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	First off, this device isn't portable. You have to have it plugged in to the wall in order to use it which makes no sense. Also, you have to download an app to even use it as regular Bluetooth connection just didn't seem simple enough for them. Lastly, the sound quality of this is pretty bad almost muffled. All In all I don't think I'm going to use it	1	April 24, 2022	0
Echo Dot	No battery or way to put one in. You have to have it plugged in at all times	3	April 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I dont understand what this product is actually designed to do. Is it a speaker? Technically yes, it is a speaker. But the sound of this speaker is so unlistenable I would never listen to music on it. Extremely grating harsh highs and the muddiest of lows even at low volumes. Otherwise I guess I could ask Alexa to do things. I dont understand why I'd do this with a phone in my hand. One swipe and I have a search engine at my fingertips. This is much easier than waiting for Alexa to find me useful information audibly with no screen to scan for what I need. In the end I'm totally confused as to what this things function is actually supposed to be.	2	March 8, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The speaker portion is fairly decent an good quality  the thing that alarming to me is sometimes it lights up unexpectedly as if it‚Äôs listening to your conversations I moved it toward the tv for fun and it did almost always stay yellow ringed like it was listening I now keep the mic off unless I‚Äôm using it	3	December 26, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Doesnt play when using camera or using Snapchat video. Has to be pulled up in order to use which is not that convenient. Any other speaker is better.	3	December 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I find myself having to repeat everything which is annoying	3	May 20, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The sound volume is not the best	3	June 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"The device itself is what it should be, but the only person in our house who wants Amazon listening to every word you say is our child, to whom the novelty is more important than her privacy. After agreeing to a bunch of security and privacy contracts, I had to set the Dot up through my account. It can't just be used as a standalone smart speaker, so everything you do with it is linked to your Amazon account. When my child asked it to play music, it started playing a Punk Rock Channel. I set up a family account to try to fix it, but it then tells you that Echo isn't available on children's accounts. Waste of time and money, signed over more privacy to Amazon, and overall useless for what we wanted it for. We unplugged it within 10 minutes because of the account issues and my child kept getting creeped out when the speaker would activate without saying ""hey Alexa."""	1	January 7, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Alexa seems to be smarter than Siri, but the sound quality of the speaker is mediocre at best. The sound is muddy and hard to understand, especially at low volumes. Given the price of the unit, it's fairly good value for money, but a little better electronics for a few more bucks would be worth it to me.	3	January 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Stopped working in a couple weeks and trying to get it fixed is a nightmare!!!	2	February 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Great smart device with poor sound quality. This MUST be paired with a quality speaker if you want quality sound.  The native speakers built-in are absolutely horrible.	3	December 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I have to say that I‚Äôm not thrilled with this product. She helps with the weather and sometimes plays the music that we ask for, but that‚Äôs about it. She gets the answers wrong more than 50% of the time even with very specific, very simple query‚Äôs. TBH, I am not impressed...	3	March 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Pros :+ Good sound quality+ Good voice recognition+ Good supporting app+ Many featuresCons :- Wouldn‚Äôt connect to internet after a month	3	December 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It's a basic speaker. I feel like there wasn't a lot put into the one speaker, so that you could buy more of them.Also, what a rip off it's not portable. Someone else who reviewed this linked to a portable adapter, and it was worth it, but I shouldn't have had to buy an additional product for this one product to be more functional.Alexa is convenient but I still don't know about her always listening. She's collecting some weird data from listening to my phone when it's not connected and is playing something like the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.	2	August 28, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I have the Apple Pod which has an excellent speaker which Alexia is unable to match. I bought the Alexia because you are able to use the voice system to play Sirius XM with Apple you have to go through the app. Plus Sirius XM sent an email with a coupon for this dot model for $10.00 couldn‚Äôt pass it up and put it in the bedroom. The only big issue is it offers with the Alexia seems to always push sales of certain items you ask it to play where i don‚Äôt get that with Apple Pod . But for 10 bucks not bad.....	2	August 1, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Overall an ok item. It helps us with timers for logging in of distance learning class sessions, plays music for us and will give us a quick news update along with weather update. I'm having trouble keeping it connected to our light though. I wanted it to help us turn light on and off but it keeps disconnecting to the lamps which makes it so time consuming to keep reconnecting. Also, safety hazard when you're expecting the light to work but then it doesn't.	2	February 5, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I replaced my second generation Alexa Echo Dot with this one. The microphone And voice recognition was superior on the second generation but the sound quality when playing music and making phone calls is better on the third generation.	3	August 5, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I got this to play lullabies for my daughter when I put her to bed. I've had it for about 3 months now and lately it's been playing one song then turning off, despite settings and length commands. Very hit or miss with the issue. That's my only complaint but it's a pretty big one considering why I bought it.	3	December 11, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Typical Alexa but I was surprised with the quality of sound... we use it on our outdoor covered patio.	3	March 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Alexa's  does well when she plays. Sometime she will cut off on her on. Doesn't always do as you ask.  Have to repeat yourself with her.  We enjoy Alexa's most of the time.Linda, Bill	3	August 12, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†In the Caribbean features are limited by Alexa. E.g. voice calls does not work. As a Bluetooth device it does not work for Zoom. Then their are times it simple cuts off and I have to unplug it, I haven't had it more than 1 month but I still like it maybe I got a faulty one but for a basic smart home it's okay."	3	October 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I was hoping it would also work as a Bluetooth speaker but it does not. Speaker sounds good but it‚Äôs not the best.	3	March 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I got this just to have as a bluetooth speaker. It was easy to set up and sounds great. BUT, every so often, without warning, it ""helpfully"" informs that it is ""playing from desktop xxxxx"". I checked online - there is NO WAY to turn that off. Pretty much makes it useless to use as a bluetooth speaker since I don't need that hollering at me at random times. Sad since it really does give a good sound."	2	March 19, 2021	0
Echo Dot	We have echo dots in 3 rooms.  Now that my kids does distant learning, I program reminders into Alexa to remind them when their next zoom lesson starts.  Don't get me wrong, they can tell time...Alexa helps to keep them on task.  My only problem is that they recently updated the reminder and it has become more cumbersome to use.  I use to be able  customize my reminder so that it's every Mon/Wed/Fri.  Now I have to set them all individually.  Also, I use to be able to select multiple devices I want the notification to remind on.  Now, I can only select one or all, I would need to cancel the whole reminder and start over again.  It would be so much better if the reminder feature was more flexible to let me change which devices I want the reminder to announce on and also be able to select multiple days for the same reminder.  If it does not work itself out, I might try something different.	1	September 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Sometimes doesn't respond at all or don't understand I  can be right on it and ask something it won't come on other times will come on and I don't say anything it is what it is I guess !	3	July 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I love having the ability to control lights and the tv in my house with just my voice, however often have to repeat commands multiple times before they are followed. Not all apps are compatible with the Alexa and so finding switches and plugs is a little hard, make sure to read reviews.	3	February 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Hmmm have not set it up because it took a MONTH to get my TV that arrived with a foot missing. Another week to get feet. Which may not work with the TV ....My friends will help me set up tomorrow	3	July 15, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Nice unit, works well, but not very good voice. Unit has a bass sound not really clear and distinct.	3	April 25, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Has it's problems st times, completely not answering to your requests. Then you listen to rumbling of conversations by what appears to be other users somewhere. When it stops working, you have to reset the whole system back up including your smart plugs or sny cameras & its one big pain in the butt! Common Amazon, get it together!!!	3	December 18, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Only a company like Amazon could steal the majority of the technology that creates this device and then create a useless, garbage, horribly coded application to run it. Multiple speakers can't be added to groups due to internal errors. This device has become useless over time, the full home speaker system I purchased it for is now glitches to one speaker at a time after doing everything possible to reconnect the devices.Gg amazon you did it again.	2	March 17, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Funciona bien lo √∫nico malo es al momento de usar Spotify, despu√©s de so√±ar 4 canciones se empoza a entrecortar y se pone de color rojo y se queda as√≠ por unas horas, hasta que se reinicia.	3	August 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Convenient little gizmo. With the Amazon Music subscription it pretty much replaced my alarm radio and the MP3 player with powered speaker.Works need to be done on the speech recognition. Way too many times feels like Alexa just makes up things and plays whatever when it didn‚Äôt understand you, which is about half the time.	3	January 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Oddly, the sound quality on this gem 3 no-clock unit was substandard vs my older first generation unit.  However I have another gen 3 with clock that has great sound.	3	November 8, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Alexa was perfect when I first started using it, but as time went on I had to say Alexa 10 times for it to finally hear me. It has a whisper mode and it can hear that but can‚Äôt hear me when I talk normal. I‚Äôve also heard a lot about the government listening in on you when you aren‚Äôt even talking to it.	3	October 22, 2019	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs basically just a cleaner version of all the other generations, they all do the same thing, and this one is just more expensive. But, yet again, it is still a wonderful Alexa device and helps make my day to day life a little bit better!	3	May 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I thought it would be good buy for the family it's not every song we request she cannot find it wants me to download and buy I feel it's a scam  to spend moreo ey I feel it should have already been downloaded to Alexa and I choose if I want or not what I would like	3	December 29, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"Compared to Google Home Dot, Echo falls quite short in all areas, except integration with its own proprietary products. Echo's worst performance is understanding speech consistently and flexibility in ""intelligence"" to respond adequately. I returned my four echos and went back to Google Homes. There is just no comparison; Google is better. I wish that Amazon also sold Google Home, instead of blocking it because it competes too well with their own Echo."	3	August 5, 2019	1

Echo Dot	I like the echo... but the other devices they sent will NOT hook up to it ... the products are a off brand ... can‚Äôt find them in any list to match up .. so I will either use only the echo or have to go purchase products that work with the echo	3	February 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I had been using the Amazon echo, second generation, for several months with great success and pleasure. I had hoped that the Amazon dot would need to see requirements of my wife who is in a facility with dementia. I was disappointed to discover that the sound quality of the diet was not adequate for my poor hearing. I am sure that it would be acceptable to anyone with normal hearing. I replaced it immediately with a Amazon echo third generation and I am very pleased with it.Unfortunately, my wife is in such deep dementia that she couldn‚Äôt manipulate the device. I have learned that England had been using it with great success for sometime. I know it would be very helpful to people in the early stages of dementia.	2	January 2, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I have been enjoying my Dot for a year or so but in the last few days Alexa has been saying my name when giving me reminders. I didn't change any settings, it just started on its own. There is apparently no way of turning this off without resetting each reminder. It is very annoying and frustrating. Enough so that I unplugged it.	2	August 4, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Most of what I ask it replies with I don't know that. It isn't a great help. Not for me anyway. It is good for reminders and the alarm is never loud. It's worthless.	3	September 26, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I like that it looks nice with the light on. It is easy to connect and use with my phone. The only thing is that it have to be changed all the time. And it‚Äôs not wireless.

Echo Dot	The echo stopped working and will not connect to the internet after 3 months. Contacted support and they will not help me because it was under a business account.

Echo Dot	Overall, we love having this so we can play our toddler's favorite music without having screens out.

Echo Dot	In order for this system to work to its full potential, you are required to purchase a myriad of extraneous equipment, expensive equipment.  If you need help telling time, a weather update, or some bad jokes, she's fine by herself.	3	July 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I received this as a gift.  Due to the many ideas that have been allegedly stolen from people who've owned one of these devices, I keep mine unplugged for most of the day.  My biggest problem with this device is that it recognizes my son's voice as a child's voice upon attempting to alter the music account  (that's a plus), but not when he asks for jokes to which the responses are disturbingly inappropriate for a child.  Solid1.5, but it should be negative stars.	2	December 20, 2020	0

She will answer and now she will say ""by the way"" and suggest ways you can give amazon more money. Unplugged. Over it. My blink camera also now requires a subscription service to store videos, out of nowhere. These companies can afford to give things out for cheap and promise to be the good guys, crushing their competition, and then once it's safely dominated, ruin the user experience by making it exactly what nobody wants. And what can we do, we already have these devices and are now at the mercy of the mega company that will suck the life and enjoyment out of all the technology we grew to love."	1	April 21, 2021	0
Echo Dot	FBI has warning it should be on a separate network from the network that contains all your personal information.  This device is more integrated because you can order things from Amazon.  I truely only wanted something that would play podcasts, workouts, and music.  So, my fault, I should have ordered a different device.	3	December 29, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Often won't connect to bluetooth at all. So I can't even use it as a basic bluetooth speaker! This thing is often useless if not annoying. Why does it speak in the middle of the night at full volume while shining a bright light? Why. I wasted money on this. Low quality. Even the sound quality is poor, and makes loud STATIC NOISES when playing music, right outside of the return window. Did this for my sister's too. What a waste of money and space. May I PLEASE get a refund?	1	January 26, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Decent for the cost.  Average sound quality but won't call it ""HD""  It's a decent speaker for the shower and works well for that purpose.  I do appreciate the build quality of the speaker iteself, but the sound quality is less than the Alexa Dot so that is a bit disappointing."	3	January 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I don't have home wifi, but I have xfinity however it is not letting me set it up using the Xfinity wifi, and is asking for home wifi, which is ridiculous honestly, if I have wifi on my phone, and around me, it should let me connect without having a home wifi directly. Nonetheless haven't been able to use it since I made the purchased. Now its just sitting here on my dresser crowding my space. I must say im very regretful of this purchase.	1	February 16, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Looks better than previous generation and sound volume is higher. But the quality of the speaker needs a lot more improvement especially for speech. I found it really hard to clearly hear and understand most of Alexa's answers.	3	July 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I enjoy my Alexa device.  The voice recognition is great. The sound quality can be a little clearer.  Otherwise, I love it!	3	January 2, 2021	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs a dot and works great for Alexa. However, as a speaker it‚Äôs subpar. The tweeters vibration is noticeably depending on what surface you put. Don‚Äôt expect to use this as a speaker. Overall you  get what you pay for.	3	June 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is very polite but not very accurate.I like to ask her trivia questions. She gets stumped once in a while. I like that too.	3	December 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Im guessing you have to have it in the same room as your router because it does not connect through 1 wall from the router. Finally connected after 6 tries	3	October 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I love the echo and wanted to take advantage of the Prime Day deal to add the service to more rooms. I reviewed the terms and conditions which state the deal is limited to 2 echo's with the promo code for Prime members. When I attempted to execute the promo code the system would not accept it. I contacted support and was told because I ordered two echo dot's in the past, one in June and One in August, which I ordered without any promo code, I could not use the 2 for 1 Prime day promo code. I was then told everything is automatic in the system so I was out of luck, support could not assist, even though the offer never said anything about a first time purchase or new customer - just that it only applied to Prime members. As one of the original Prime members, I find it sad that Amazon didn't honor the terms as stated - clearly they should have disclosed this limitation in advance.	1	September 29, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"This one I had higher hopes for as it was newer and I assumed more bugs would be worked out. But I have had nothing but issues with all three of them. Music doesn't play with them, it constantly says ""I can't find that song"", I pay for amazon unlimited and should have access to all of these songs. I just feel like these should have been much better with how much I am paying for all of the amazon integrations."	2	January 11, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Purchased these over the last few years for my home and for friends and family and everyone is saying the same thing. They just do not work right anymore and there is no customer service. Very disappointed. When I reached out to the customer service folks, they told me one of my devices was too old to update...creating the issue...so bought this. Same issues.  Too bad really because the product could be great - I think the support/customer service is the issue.	1	March 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	good alexa integration but wine defective	3	June 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	i was surprised that the sound quality isn't better. it is very bassy. i finally had to add a bluetooth speaker so i could hear it better. i don't know, maybe that's how its supposed to sound. .....jim	3	July 20, 2020	1
Echo Dot	i bought 2 and it does not work as well as the first generation i have but it is much  louder and better sound quality or at least has more bass. i have had issue with it because the trigger word is a hit and miss. I also bought the show 5... that thing is pretty cool i wish they would add more featuers for customization tho.	3	August 15, 2019	1
Echo Dot	When I set up this device it was straight forward and I had no issues. A few months after the initial set up the Echo would lose the signal. Researched what could cause this, I checked my internet Signal strength, purchased a wifi extender. Contacted Amazon and performed their suggested troubleshooting. Frustrated and disappointed I left the device gather dust. The rep never suggested I return it for a replacement. The holidays and birthdays around the corner I had more important things to be concerned with. I attempted to set up the echo dot once and for all, in a new location closer to the wifi signal. Finally threw the towel in because this now seemed like a faulty device. Contacted customer service for a 2nd time and after 28 minutes and having my call escalated to a Lead because I refused a 15% discount off of the purchase of a new device. The original purchase amount was refunded. So I should be satisfied, to a point. I spent 30 minutes troubleshooting to no avail during my 1st call, 2nd call lasted 28 minutes more. Customer service should not take 2 calls and an hour for a return of $26.49.	1	January 27, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I love the quality of the sound that it puts out. But still have issues when it fails to perform there is no option to find out why it did not do what you wanted it to do.	3	July 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Not necessarily for our life style but what we've tried works well.	3	May 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I'm 76 years old which may explain my problem with understanding Alexa. Maybe a little less bass or slower speech would help.	3	February 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I was not able to set it up to control the lights, etc, and have not had any luck getting someone at Amazon to help me set it up.	3	October 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Funciona bastante bien !!!! Lastimosamente en Costa Rica no permite la integraci√≥n con Music de Apple y eso es una verdadera l√°stima, ya que yo tengo suscripci√≥n a Music de Apple y entonces no lo puedo aprovechar.	3	July 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It struggles with simple task like ‚Äúplay workout music‚Äù.	2	March 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I did not like that much as sometimes it totally fails to understand what we meant and also it keeps beeping if I kept It on mute. Another problem is we cant mute alexa by voice. We have to mute manually. Understanding bollywood songs is another big pain as it cannot identify the accent. Please fix the voice recognition and try to train with more languages. Also if volume is high , we need to shout loud to speak to Alexa and still it is pain sometimes as it doesn't understand. Understanding about radio is also messed up. I did like the sound quality and also the loudness. BASS can be better. Haven't tried other highend amazon echo show etc..would try if I start saving to get that device.	2	December 16, 2019	0
Echo Dot	It's ok. The price was right free with supscrptiion to Serius XM.  I don't use it that much as I prefer my CCCrain Wifi internet radio instead.	3	November 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa can‚Äôt do too much. She can find songs and tell us the weather but she can‚Äôt turn the TV on or off or navigate to favorite utube stations.	3	October 28, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Will not answer me till I say her name like 3 to 4 & sometimes 5. Unbelievable	2	January 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It's alright device if you bored and need something to talk to, or would rather use your voice and not your phone for most of what your phone does.  The most disappointing thing about it is having to keep it plugged in all the time, why didn't they put in a lithium battery?	3	January 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I don't use this product for much.  I don't have updated light switches, thermostats, coffee makers, light bulbs, smart TV.  Therefore, can't use this product with older stuff.  And, don't plan on spending a lot of money just so I can use this product to its fullest extent.	3	February 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	After trying to get Alexa to play city rain by sleep music for many months. It just plays  what ever it wants to especially frustrating when you are trying to go to bed.  Then it just shuts itself off for no reason. Left a whole bunch of juicy feedback to the developers though.  Finally unplugged it and bought a sound machine.  GOOD RIDANCE. Think I will give it to someone I don't like. Why am I fighting a machine that I bought reminds me of an ex wife that I've had.	1	January 10, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Had to speak to the equipment to many times to get her to answer. Not playing music requested.	3	March 17, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Ehhh it‚Äôs okay, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs any easier to wake it up by saying Alexa then the 1st generation was and  I find it quite irritating that even in a semi quiet room I have to raise my voice to get it to respond.  As for the sound quality it is definitely better.	3	December 18, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Confusing and not exactly user friendly. 99% of the time her response to anything is ‚Äú I found this on the web.‚Äù Skills and functions cost extra. Any Apple device does everything this does and better. No need to download an app to tell it what to do. It‚Äôs a great speaker though.	3	January 15, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I do not like the fact that it glitches almost every day and I have to unplug it for it to work again. The speaker is okay quality but definitely not the best. I do like the hands free capability especially while I am cooking dinner or hanging out with the family.	3	January 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Update: after a couple weeks of usage. Alexa enjoys telling about all the things she can do but when you ask her to do said item,she explains ""that it's not available on this device"". She has a very limited database of information and continually gives incorrect answers to very basic questions even when asked repeatedly."	3	December 20, 2019	1
Echo Dot	All I did was change my wifi router and the Echo Dot wouldn't connect.  After a few dozen times of factory resets and trying to connect using my phone as well as my laptop with a Firefox connection, the rep informed me that I would have to buy a new one.  Not giving Jeff (%#@) Bezos another dime of my $ if I can avoid it.	1	April 23, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I already have the first gen Alexa, when I got the 2nd Alexa, I tried to connect it together and it didn‚Äôt work.  I used to be able to turn my light on, but no more.  I was disappointed that it didn‚Äôt work anymore.  Don‚Äôt know how to correct the problem?	3	January 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Ive had the Alexa dot for a couple months and it all the sudden quit on me. It won‚Äôt connect to the internet. Ive tried technical support and they want me to do all kinds of crazy things contacting ISP and changing internet channels and many more steps. I have changed nothing since it was working so I‚Äôm not sure why they want me to do all this stuff. It‚Äôs not worth having if you don‚Äôt have a computer degree for when something goes wrong. Not good customer service so if you get it cheap enough to go through one every couple months, go ahead and buy. If you don‚Äôt want to go through the hassle, I would skip. Bad customer support when something goes wrong! I was treated like I was a dummy when I told the tech I didn‚Äôt know how to change bandwidths and channels and that kind of stuff.	1	February 3, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I got this for free with a fireTV. Unfortunately, the TV can't interface with the dot and vice versa.... So I'm unsure what I need it for.I have it plugged in, and it listens to me watch movies and junk, but I have no use for it.But if I did, I'd have a high quality speaker with great voice recognition.	3	September 10, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Echo dot plays music randomly, doesn't listen to your commands, doesn't work with Fire TV well and is not worth your money. Get Spotify! I pay monthly for this Amazon music app for over a year and it just disappointments tremendously!  I got 3 Echo dots btw and most of my stuff can be operated by Alexa. Now I am looking to get rid of all my Alexa crap for a better replacement? Any ideas and I hopw this helpa. Fyi a few of my friends bad an Echo ans they experience similiar problems....	1	January 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I like most everything about it but:1.  Sound quality. It is very difficult to make out what that woman is saying. I paired it with a Bluetooth speaker for some improvement but Alexa still sounds like she is speaking from a well.2.  Will not print. Recognizes the printer and claims to send list to printer. Nothing happens at printer. I print wireless with other apps.	2	April 5, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The Echo Dot with Alexa sounds distorted at times, although rarely. Also she will stop playing music or read my books on Kindle and lose her position. When I have her go back and play or read from where she left off, she does not. She will read from another random place in the book.	3	December 23, 2019	1

Echo Dot	It was good for the first two weeks I owned it. After that it started having trouble understanding and connecting to my perfectly good internet.

Echo Dot	The speaker have to charged to much. Sometimes Alexa don't to stop on command.	3	April 9, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I made the mistake of standardizing on echo devices. And my family regrets it. Aside from all the privacy concerns that are reasonable, with each new iteration the echoes become worse. They are cluttered with capabilities you will never use which makes the basic uses ‚Äì sleep noise, music, weather, and other simple tasks - buried under a mountain of garbage.Yes, the early morning notifications are tedious. Yes, the 10-word responses are tedious. Yes, Amazon Sidewalk is an invasion.But these devices fail at their basic reason for being: playing music. They are unpredictable, buggy, and incapable of simple commands - often commands that worked as recently as last week.Look elsewhere. Ask Alexa what is the best speaker on the market. She will tell you Sonos. Heed her this once.	1	July 7, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The ECHo dot seemed like a good choice for playing music in my small home office, but I found the sound quality to be acceptable only for spoken word.	3	October 2, 2020	1

Echo Dot	The sound is to muffled. Adjusted the settings but still muffled. It does not recognize the wake word most of the time ( does not light up)and an echo two rooms away answers.

Echo Dot	The sound is kinda muffled. And I have to unplug it and plug it back in every couple of days because it gets stuck on the yellow light circle thing, or it just doesn't respond at all.

Echo Dot	"I did enjoy the weather, the question of the day and the music.

The ""circle of light"" went away!"	3	January 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	If this thing worked completely it would be AMAZING! But I had problems getting it to work with my Amazon fire sticks right out of the box. It shows my device in the list but will not actually control it or any of the apps on it. I've done everything I was supposed to and even reached out to tech support but nothing work. Also the lights would flash at random times even though there weren't any alerts. Maybe mine was defective, but I would use my google home over this any day.	2	September 17, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I'm pretty disappointed that this doesn't work with Samsung Series 8 TV. All i wanted to do is ask Alexa to turn on my TV and go to Netflix but i guess its still too early for Alexa.	3	June 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I like what Alexa is capable of doing, just doesn't do it completely well yet. Need the manufacturers to create more and better skills to utilize Alexa. Additionally Alexa is a little buggy on it's own. My Echo show, will display a picture but won't advance the slide show to the next picture.	3	January 5, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I already have the Echo large in my kitchen which I enjoy.

Echo Dot	Had used this since Christmas. Having problems with Echo not hearing requests even when standing close to it.

Echo Dot	Has great sound easy to setup. But any interuptions in wifi have to go thru the alexa app to reconnect not happy with that !!	3	November 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I find setting a quick timer useful, but the awful sound that it makes to notify me of the timer completion, needs to have an option to altered in the alexa app. It does not have that option. That is the first illogical point, since the alarm sound has that option. The second illogical point is that the alarm and timer share the same volume setting, but not the same sound choice. That it's certainty the third illogical point. The fourth illogical point applies to both the alarm and timer. Three is no automatic cessation of around after a certain number of repetitions. That is desperately needed. When Amazon improves these features, I can rate the device higher.	1	November 5, 2021	0

Echo Dot	We have had our little gem for one and one-half weeks, we often forget that it is there, but when we do remember to have exchanges with it, this is pleasant. so we like it with all the stuff it offers for; facts, current whats going on everywhere, has humor to offer upon request, music for all day, should one want to engage in that ...	3	July 31, 2019	1

Echo Dot	Got it as a discounted gift. Really don't have much need for it yet. Seems to have problems understanding commands. Maybe I'm not articulate enough. I'm sure down the road I'll get to enjoy it more.	3	July 12, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Works great when it works. Sometimes it will just randomly stop playing music and responding. Unplugging and restarting seems to fix this issue but it‚Äôs still annoying. Alexa doesn‚Äôt always respond and sometimes misunderstands requests. Sound quality is good though and it‚Äôs nice to have hands free music at our disposal.	3	January 19, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"We've enjoyed an Echo Dot for a few years and thought this would make a nice holiday gift for my wife's sister. When we got ours, it was a simple matter to pair the Echo Dot with our computer's Bluetooth. How things have changed! I suspect so that Amazon can enhance its data mining/privacy-violating capabilities. When I attempted to install our sister's Windows 10 laptop, the nightmare began. ""Install the Alexa App,"" I was told. Of course, there is no App for a laptop. After a couple of hours of trying some sort of workaround, all failing, I deferred to another day. This weekend, I thought that I'd get assistance in what I thought must somehow be a simple installation (as ours had been); I sought Amazon's technical support's assistance. A couple of hours later, after being handed off in turn to a total of six ""experts"" none of whom could come up with any solution, I decided to return the device.  Ugh..."	1	October 18, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Dissappointed...ought to make it OBVIOUS, like with CAPIAL LETTERS, that this device is NOT wireless.  Didn't need an extra device that has to be plugged in.  My (Amazon) tablet works without being plugged in, and already has Alexa, so what was the point? Shady non disclosure.	3	February 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Sound is really good however voice and Alexa leave a lot to be desired. Very frequently after asking Alexa to stop playing music, it will just resume 5-10 min later. Often times you will tell Alexa to stop playing music and it will sim the music as if it‚Äôs listening, and then do nothing. Only way to stop both issues is to unplug device.	3	August 21, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The sound quality is definitely sub-par. The spoken words are difficult for me to understand.Music from other sources is clear and easy to listen to.	3	November 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I find it a waste of space, meaning anything I can do with Alexa I can do without Alexa - it saves nothing - and can you imagine - to use it for a lamp - will cost you 25.00 for a plug - Seriously.  I honestly don't use the echo very much.  Guess the best feature is - Alexa - temp - but I have a thermometer - and can read it just as easy.	2	January 11, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Useless has no real instructions, ask it how set anything from a TV to a light fixture it says I can not help you and when you use the Alexa app it gives like a 1000 examples but nothing to the point one thing it kept saying was you need to reset you're routers isp protocols with no instructions as to how that is done and why it has to be done, like I said needs a lot of work, a lot of work 1 star.

Echo Dot	Mostly needed for work and my job has an open WiFi network, my echo won't connect to open WiFi networks. Kind of bummed. Maybe the next upgrade will be able to connect to open WiFi networks. Other than that it works great.. easy to set up, easy and fun to use.	3	January 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	So far it's been a good product... only reason why I give it 3 stars because I still dont know and not so familiar on how to use it and what to use it for besides weather and music and alarms.... hopefully I can learn more! I would definitely buy it again.	3	January 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This was a Christmas gift from my husband.  It worked well for the first 7 months and then the day before yesterday when I asked Alexa to shuffle songs by Elton John (I have Amazon Music) she did not respond.  I got out the box and tried to reboot, it would not respond. We reset my password still nothing.  There is nothing listed in the packaging that gives you info on where to go for support.  Called a support company and because I didn‚Äôt purchase their Tech support package they couldn‚Äôt help me.	2	July 29, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"I have purchased two of these. I ordered one in 2019 and one in 2020. With the first one, the speaker went out in less than one year. With the second purchase, the dot just went ""dead,"" would not even light up after less that 4 months. Not a reliable product. Way overpriced for the quality. I did not even use them that often. When I called customer service after the second one stopped working, they first sent me the link for an extended warranty, which I felt implied I should have spent more upfront. Then they told me I would have to replace the adapter chord for $20 That was half of the price I paid for the dot including the adapter chord. In my opinion, this is taking advantage of customers. I am very disappointed in Amazon for this."	1	April 23, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Very disappointed I asked her a couple questions about the border and how many people were coming over and she did not know and then I asked her something else and forgot about the government she said she can't answer those so the next day my alarm went off and I told her to shut it off well she wouldn't after 10 times of asking her I pulled the plug	2	March 25, 2021	0

Echo Dot	It's ok its fun wish she be more of a smart ass	3	April 27, 2021	1
Echo Dot	3 stars but only because Amazon bundled light bulbs that need an extra connection to an Ethernet and their own app which then connects to Alexa. Waste. I have 2 bulbs purchased before that require no more than a simple connection to Alexa. Amazon threw in a product for no reason. Junk.	3	December 31, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"I listen to a lot of classical music. The Echo Dot does not ""measure up."" If I want to listen to a symphony, I want to listen to the - entire - symphony, not just one movement.

Echo Dot	I got this a little over a year and a half ago. She died, right there in my bedroom! I hardly ever used this one, and then one day, she lost her voice, completely! She could still hear me, but she couldn't speak anymore! After going thru the help people, they said I would have to replace her. Yep, it cost me another $50 to get the generation 4, in place of the 3. They gave me a 15% discount, but I would be very weary to get this one. Just what I dealt with, maybe she didn't like me!	1	December 21, 2021	0

Echo Dot	The unit started overheating and shutting down unexpectedly within 3 months of purchasing. I contacted Amazon and their customer service seemed unclear on what to expect now - The service rep claimed that I should get a replacement unit in 5 business day, now the order page claims it will take up to 10 days. All my lights were connected to Alexa, so this is a major inconvenience and this lack of clarity in the timing of solution isn't encouraging. I haven't heard anyone with Google Home having such issues...	1	January 24, 2022	0

Echo Dot	If you want a speaker to listen to music I would say the 3rd gen, is better. However if like me I just use it for information the 2 nd gen is much clearer. I find it harder to understand what Alexa is saying on the 3 rd. gen, but the music sounds great.	3	December 4, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"Hard did get it to link other devices to it. Have amazon music but echo will not use. Alexa said "" I don't have that skill"" Alexa said "" I can't do that"" more then anything.

Echo Dot	works great with prime or unlimited. Music is very general with out subscription. You can't listen to a specific song, just stations. It's more like a voice controlled radio and simple short stories, not books unless you purchase or subcription.	3	May 17, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I thought the sound wasn‚Äôt that great. I knew it was a small speaker but the bass sounded worse the louder I played it.	3	November 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Biggest issue I have with these is they really don't like skipping songs and often don't take you to the right song on Pandora. In the commands history it shows that some were heard correctly but they didn't follow the command, and others were not understood... This issue seems to be getting worse, for the size they are pretty loud and sound pretty good (could be better but could be much worse) I don't want to upgrade to the 4th gen because I don't like the spherical shape of them.Update;Their ability to follow commands is much worse, almost to the point of useless. The oldest one I have won't follow commands from 5ft away, if I'm listening to music I have to push the button and it still doesn't follow commands...	1	June 6, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Since Audible is an Amazon company, I don‚Äôt see why it is so darn difficult to play Audible books on my Echo dots.  It won‚Äôt play on a speaker group unless I do it through the app, and the app totally sucks.  If I miss a bit and want to rewind a few seconds, it practically takes an act of Congress, a dispensation from the Pope, and a team of twenty mules to manage it.  Most of the time, I have to disable the app completely, find the place I want on the Audible app, and then re-start Alexa, and even then, it only works about half the time.  I‚Äôm about to give up on it.Additionally, my routines, which I have created to help manage my time, do not consistently work.  I never know whether it‚Äôll work or not.I don‚Äôt know what good the actual dot does if the app won‚Äôt function properly.  But I‚Äôm sure it makes a nice decoration and can impress the occasional guest when I ask it a direct question like the weather.	1	March 28, 2020	0

Echo Dot	The dot is nice to have but it turns on at time, like the middle of the night, by itself. It also requires weekly rebooting for me to listen to SiriusXM.	3	August 28, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This product is a little too invasive for me. At the same time, I mainly use these things for music and Alexa wants you to pay for a music subscription in order to listen to music. (It also picks up on your conversation more often.) Otherwise, you have to use it as a bluetooth speaker and cast from your phone which is a pain. I would much rather just use G00gle home but this was a gift.	2	January 7, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I have talked to Echo customer service several times in the last three weeks. The first time I was on the phone for an hour. The woman I talked to had very limited knowledge in troubleshooting she would put me on hold , speak to someone else regarding what to try next. The issue is that the speakers will not play music and it gives me a message that it does not support audio.  She was never able to fix the issue after being on the phone for over an hour. she said someone would call me back in 24-48 hours -no one called me back. Called Echo CS again a week later, he was unable to tell me why the device wasn't working and I was told again that some one would call me back. no one called me back. I will be throwing my echo devices in the trash. I have other BOSE of speakers that work fine.	1	October 30, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I am trying to integrate my music library (I have over 10,000 songs) with alexa and with my wired speakers I have installed all around my house.  Amazon apparently does not want you to be able to do this.  There are some work around apps which aren't really perfected yet.  I can control mymusic on my computer, when I'm in front of my computer but I can not control my music from any other alexa device, I am unable to increase volume, change song or anything else from a separate alexa device.  You also cannot play Any music on 2 separate alexa devices UNLESS you pay amazon $15 per month for the pleasure, of course you get their music library but I have enough music.  I am going to search for alternatives to alexa.	1	April 29, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Alexa worked great for a while. One day a couple months ago I started to see duplicate devices.  I delete them and they are back the next day. I am not sure where they are being advertised from but Alexa buys it every time. It is getting old deleting them before a family member gets the ‚Äúfound more than one device with that name‚Äù error.

Echo Dot	Like the stand alone, but trying to link with Amazon Alexa to play music simultaneously, is futile. Instructions are useless for anyone not tech savvy.

Echo Dot	"This is the worst. I was so excited, but alexa doesn't do anything you ask her to do. You can't go in the app and set it up to pay specific playlists or songs like it says you can. You set up ""routines"" in the app, but all you do is type into the app what you would say to alexa and alexa doesn't know what the hell you're taking about. She plays songs similar to what your saying, but not the same. The ""loop mode"" doesn't work. It starts playing random crap that i didn't ask for if i tell it to loop. There really isn't anything that works correctly on here. This thing is pointless unless you want to ask what the weather is today. That's about it."	1	July 12, 2021	0

Echo Dot	I purchased my Dot during the holiday sales to use as a radio.  I first spent an hour or two in January during which I consulted the enclosed directions, downloaded the app to my KIndle Fire, and tried to keep going.  Google search gave me a website for help.  Phone help took control of my computer, sold me new security software (for 4X what I paid for the Dot), and finally got me connected to Alexa.  Alexa could find NPR, but she couldn't find any other station using the call letters.  By the way, the only way to turn off the Dot is unplug it.  Now it's two months later.  On my end table are the dot, my smart phone, and my Fire.  The Dot announced it was connected 20 minutes ago and would let me know when she was ready.  I'm using the time to let you know the Dot is not for technical amateurs.  Now I'll go back to watching the Orange light go around.  Frankly, I like the blue and green better.	1	March 17, 2020	0

Echo Dot	Typically in tech, things improve with each new version. Sadly, the progression from 2nd gen to 3rd gen Alexa has resulted in a very muffled voice for Alexa. I can't stand it. It sounds like Alexa is activating from under a blanket. I'm surprised more people don't complain about this in the reviews. If you google about it, then you will find lots of amazon forums discussing the terrible sound quality.I have tweaked the Treble, Mid, and Low range EQ in the Alexa app. Cranking the treble and lowering the two bass settings did not provide a meaningful improvement in sound quality.I think they tried to make bass improvements from 2nd to 3rd but they did it at the expense of verbal audio quality.I have two of these 3rd gens and I plan to return them. I don't want to constantly strain to hear a muffled response from Alexa. I'd rather have 2nd gens.	1	October 10, 2020	0

Spent an hour chatting with ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù to be told our warranty expired in February and theres nothing they can do. After arguing they offered me 15% off a new device‚Ä¶ so buy this if you like replacing your purchases every few months. Our 2nd generation echo still works great.	1	March 17, 2022	0
Echo Dot	No se ve el reloj. √âste es el segundo que mandan. El primero no se pod√≠a configurar. Devinieran mejorar la inspecci√≥n de calidad antes de revenderlos.	3	October 7, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Don't use it all that much, so it just kind of sits there. Use youtube or other apps.	3	January 15, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I have many Echos of all flavors. This is my least favorite because of the boomy muddy bass and its large size compared to its predecessors. Smaller is better for me, not larger. Other than that, it works like the other Echo Dots. For the price when on sale, it was good.	3	December 15, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Alexa used to be able to turn on and off my tv. She has somehow decided she isn‚Äôt compatible anymore. Oftentimes she will hear me ask her to turn off all my lights say ‚Äúokay‚Äù and then not do it. She is nice for conversations and music though.	3	February 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The product needs two audio settings - one so the command voice is regular volume, and one for music.  At night I like music to play very softly while I sleep, but this also requires turning down the voice volume, which is then hard to hear during the day.	3	January 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This works well for voice, alarms and drop ins. Wouldn't recommend for music.I got the wall mount free, I wouldn't recommend buying it.	3	October 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I was hoping to be able to use this with my iPhone to make phone calls. It connects to my Wi-Fi network and Bluetooth to my phone. But when I give a command Alexa call ‚Äúone of my contacts‚Äù which did load in. The other person can hear the phone ringing but nothing when they answer it and I never hear anything	3	August 6, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I've called and tried to explain the issue with no prevail. Alexa you have to yell just to get a response and then half the time she skips and cuts out right in the middle of talking. The sound quality is not good. I think my advice is defective	3	January 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Me gusta pero no es lo que esperaba esta muy limitada	3	April 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Well the music comes and goesSome songs play all way through but more stop and start later	3	February 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I love my Echo Dot v2. Amazon had a nice special on the Dot v3 on Prime Day so I bit. Big mistake. As many people have pointed out, Alexa's voice is terribly muffled and indistinct. There is no way to change this. Equalizer settings only apply to music and not Alexa's voice. I updated the firmware with no improvement.Do a Google search on ""Echo dot muffled"" and see what you find.I hate returning things. But this goes back. :("	2	October 16, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Unreliable... always a problem with the Hardware and Alexa!!! I have deployed 2 of these lemons and they are nothing but one issue  after another. I still have 3 sitting in a bag; but see no reason to deploy them as that would just increase issues and my frustration with their complete unreliability. There are so many issues I don't know where to start... so here are a few... 1) Alexa often can't understand what I say (yes, I speak in the same voice tone and level); 2) One in the kitchen does not work sometimes; but the one in the bedroom does;  3) One or both of them are always disconnecting... my Phone never disconnects, my PC never disconnects, my TV never disconnects! 4) I have called Amazon Tech multiple times and had them fix things; but that does not last long.Hey Google... you out there... I'll trade you 5 Echo Dot 3's... for 3 of your devices!!! üòé	1	August 27, 2020	0
Echo Dot	You must clearly speak at least twice before it gets it.  It turns off unexpectedly.  When you check the app, everything appears to be fine.	3	September 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This echo dot only seems to work half of the time. It says something is wrong with the internet but the other echo dot and everything else connected to it works great. Really bummed that it doesn‚Äôt work how it should. Been thinking about exchanging for a new one. Right now all it‚Äôs good for is a speaker if my phone is hooked up to it. But even then it will just stop playing on the echo dot all together. Super frustrating	2	November 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Ask it a question and it gives an answer.  Plays music ok. What else it does I don't know. It was free to me but not something I would have bought.	3	July 28, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Last generation sounded and responded better. Alexa sounds as if she is talking thru a pillow.	3	February 9, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I like its usefulness for scheduling but other than that she say hmm im not sure or something along those lines. For the most part not impressed.	3	September 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Not sure I really enjoy this speaker I don‚Äôt like the fact that I can‚Äôt just use it with only Bluetooth and that it has to be plugged in the whole time while using it I wish it didn‚Äôt loose signal soEasily kind of thinking of returning this üòï	3	December 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I use this product to listen to the music streaming from my iPhone.	3	March 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I bought the Echo Dot for my room. My idea was simply to have music while in my room and also access to news, the weather, etc. ie basic information that I need daily and that I will get from the web but that I could save some time if it were provided for me.  Well after a month or so, for whatever reason, that is not transparent to me, ""Alexa"" doesn't know where I am. It is unable to play my newscasts and is basically useless but as speaker that is connected to Amazon Music.  I thought I was buying so much more and I feel ripped off."	2	March 5, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Did not come with instructions. Have spent 2 hours with Apple representative and it still doesn‚Äôt work.  Hk	1	September 29, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It would be nice if this worked with the Fire TV stick. But it DOESN‚ÄôT turn the Fire TV Stick on and off‚Äîand Amazon has no intention of fixing that. To them, Echo Dot not working with Fire TV Stick is a feature, not a bug.	3	February 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	So I bought this, had Amazon music unlimited, then realized it charged $15 a month!!! Without Amazon music unlimited, you can‚Äôt really play anything. I wrote down 17 songs and only 1 worked. Useless! Lower the price... but everything else is fine. Also, when the echo dot says that I have to buy Amazon music unlimited, the voice goes static and weird.	2	June 15, 2021	0
Echo Dot	hay que hablerle muy alto, a veces no escucha, hay que hablarle lento para que reconozca bien el comando que se le da.	3	November 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Liked the ‚Äúsound‚Äù of the speaker.  Pleasant enough.  Setting up skills seems more trouble and time consuming for the inconsistent results you get.  So ... myeh, no big whoop.	3	July 24, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I am just now getting to know Alexa. She doesn't always understand what I am saying. I ask for a particular type of music and she plays something else. I would like the dot better if I could stream my own ""copied"" music on I Tunes through the dot."	3	January 10, 2020	1

Echo Dot	My 1st generation Echo ...in my opinion the sound was much better... and I paid $4.99 for amazon music now it says $9.99 I had it for a long time	3	August 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I Wish it supported apps like SoundCloud and YouTube but overall good product	3	March 2, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I bought this to go with my new Sony Bravia OLED. It can never ‚Äúlocate the TV‚Äù when i ask Alexa to turn it on. Once I manually turn on the television, it works fine‚Ä¶ But it definitely has hiccups. Also, Alexa‚Äôs jokes are lame. Just saying.	3	February 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Used to be great but now trash.  Almost no customer support, app gets wore with every update.  Now it cannot even tell if something is a switch or light.  Constantly disconnects,  hardly ever works correctly with Spotify.  No new music support.  Forced ads on all screen devices.  Alexa is a joke anymore.  Switching to Google home.	1	April 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I had to wait a couple days, but it finally pairs with my android phone. I am using it primarily for hands- free phone calls, as I don't like holding the phone to my ear.	3	June 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	We already had the Echo, but wanted the Dot in our garage and upstairs in the bedrooms thinking we could run them separately. Unfortunately, I am not finding any way to do it. So it's either all or nothing. Not thrilled, so returned one of the three we bought.	3	January 8, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"PRODUCT ARRIVED IN WORKING CONDITION.  TERRIBLE VOICE RECOGNITION.  HORRIBLE SPEAKER QUALITY. VERY FEW USEFULL SKILLS.  THE ONLY ONLY ONLY ONLY REASON TO BUY ANY ALEXA DEVICE IS IF YOUR SPART HOME SYSTEM REQUIRES IT.  ALL THE MUSIC APPS ARE HORRIBLE, ANT THE THING CONSTALTLY WANTS YOU TO UPGRADE TO AMAZON PRIME OR GET AMAZON MUSIC OR WHATEVER OTHER SUBPAR SERVICES THEY OFFER.  FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN LISTENING TO SPOTIFY, YOU ARE LOCKED INTO WHAT I CALL ""FAKE SHUFFELPLAY"".  ITS LIKE NORMAL SHUFFELPLAY, BUT YOU CAN ONLY PLAY PLAYLISTS.  WANNA HEAR ACDC BACK IN BLACK?  TOO BAD, HERES A PLAYLIST INSPIRED BY ACDC, WITH 2 OR 3 SONGS FROM ACDC THEMSELVES.  AND THATS JUST SPOTIFY, EVERY SKILL ON ALEXA IS JUST LIKE THAT, LACKING TO THE POINT OF BEING WORTHLESS"	1	April 19, 2021	0

Echo Dot	After 3 months the voice recognition really took a dive and stopped working. Now I've got a cheap Bluetooth speaker.	3	December 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Funny thing, I never buy any Echo's myself. My kids have given me the first Echo Dot as a Christmas present, and I have won this one. What should I say, the new one has a better design and multicolor lights. And to be honest I counted all the adantages. The sound quality pretty far from perfect but the worst part - Bluetooth. I have MS Surface connected to it and all I can say  - nightmare. Delays, distortions. It drops connections. Then it reconnects back but the sound stream goest to the limbo.Don't get me wrong, I still happy with my old Echo - big and sturdy. Great sound and I can't complain about anything	2	December 30, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I thought this was like a regular blue tooth connect speaker but it's not you have to down load a app to get connection so right there I new this may not work for me but I gave it a try anyway. the first thing was down load app and then make sure speaker is plugged in and then open app sign in to your acct. which I had to do about three times so after 30 min. of doing all that I decided just to forget it uninstall app from my phone and just put that thing in a drawer and for get about it so it will never see day light again so that  where that's at. That's my experience with that device I'm sure someone more savvy with these  thing would have no problem good luck to them.	1	February 24, 2021	0
Echo Dot	It works pretty good.  It is harder to understand these speakers than the older echo dot.  Maybe too much base for her replying.	3	October 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt know....it‚Äôs just not quite the nanny I was expecting. I was thinking with a name like Alexa she‚Äôd be golden, but instead I just felt like she was eavesdropping all the time. Pretty subpar for a nanny for my 6 and 8 year old....would be a better spy.	3	December 26, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Listen to sirius	3	June 5, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I would have thought the 3rd Gen. would be an improvement over the 2nd.  It is not.  Alexa doesn't have a clear crisp voice like she does on our older dots and she doesn't understand what we are saying as well as the older ones.  We much prefer the older ones.	3	November 8, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Initial it was a nice addition to our home. The kids all love it . It very easy for the kids to do research to help them with school work. Now Alexa is constantly say, I don‚Äôt understand that or I am having difficulty, please try later	1	June 12, 2022	0

Echo Dot	There are times when I will ask for a particular song and will be told that in order to access it I will have to join a membership, and sometimes it will play a bad version, sometimes a live version that it almost unrecognizable.  eg. Gentle on my Mind.	3	December 24, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I loved it because the sound quality was better than the 1st & 2nd generation, but after about a month the speaker went out and had a short in it so it was annoying to listen to it all break up after every other word.	3	February 20, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Very hard to understand.  Tried different locations.  Tried an aux speaker. No luck.	3	February 2, 2021	1
Echo Dot	You have to have it plugged in in order to use it. For the google home you do not need no plug in only to charge when there‚Äôs low battery. Then they make it seem like it doesn‚Äôt need to be plugged in to power on but it does.	3	January 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This Echo Dot for most part works okay most times. However, I‚Äôve notice it not responding and I have to repeat my sentence almost telling before it will respond. Overall, it‚Äôs good to have more than one in home for convenience sake.	3	March 22, 2020	1
Echo Dot	If you set reminders with it, you have to give it a time.  This is an disadvantage sometimes.	3	December 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Opened package and box was covered in a sticky, scented lotion or something, so I said no thanks in the midst of a pandemic and wrapped it back up to send it back.	3	July 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs ok. Having something record all sounds in your home is a bit creepy...	3	March 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The Echo Dot works as expected. However, after purchasing several to place around our house, I was informed the price for the Amazon unlimited music would increase. It would no longer be $3.99 a month  but $14.99 a month. In all the Amazon ads that talk about the advantages of having several units to place around our homes it never mentions that once you do the cost would increasing. To me this is false advertising. So if you are buying an Echo to listen to music and are thinking about several units be aware that Amazon will raise the cost. And once those units are attached to your account there is no going back.	2	January 22, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Title says it all. Endless difficulties streaming music. Half the time, it just stops in the middle of or at the end of a song. No matter how many times I've talked to amazon, and I've spent several hours on the phone with them, the problem persists. This is not the device to have if you plan to reliable stream music.	1	April 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Most times, Alexa does not have an answer or searches for something unrelated.	3	March 22, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"I was very disappointed to learn my Alexa was unable to play certain playlists without a subscription to Amazon Prime.

Echo Dot	If you are not tone def you will HATE these, and if you can still tell quality sound, they are still over priced pieces of garbage. They probably buy these for $5 . DO NOT waste your money in these!!! It‚Äôs cool they integrate, but it‚Äôs gurgly and NO sound quality.	2	August 14, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Overall not bad but I switched over from a google home. The reason I switched was for the integration of Alexa and all amazon related apps which helps consolidate everything into one. The way it works with smart lights and other smart tech is pretty standard.	3	February 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It is a neat little contraption.  Would be better if it could function on a LAN without an internet connection to function.  Even limited functionality would be nice.	3	August 8, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Alexa is great for hands free function but is initially difficult to pair with other devices. I still haven‚Äôt been able to successfully pair with my insignia fire tv... The devices I have been able to pair with work well and she even understands voice commands from my kids.	3	December 31, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I'm sure it works great, but I haven't really been able to use it much since I am not a huge fan of voice commands, and I'm not home much. I still need to explore it's integration abilities and functions.  Until then, just 3-star for now.	3	January 18, 2020	1

Echo Dot	The interface for the system is getting even more annoying. Issues with loud vocalizations when Bluetooth devices connect, to forcing autoplay in every device that it's connected to - the Echo Dot with Alexa is getting worse in every way other than as a speaker.Sellers try to throw in their dots as free items bundled with other products, but they aren't worth it. I'd prefer a slightly cheaper cost to one of these poorly interfaced clods.	2	November 18, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Wish I could have used this thing, but after spending over 2 freaking hours with Amazon Kindle/Echo Techs on the phone trying to simply connect it to my WiFi signal through my iPhone, which I note has not had a single problem since I moved into this apartment in July 2019, I got pissed and gave up and realized that it had been a big waste of time and inconvenience to try and set up a cheap $24 plastic spy toy that I will probably rarely use.I called Comcast Xfinity 3 times, had a technician come out and they said they could not figure out why my WiFi connection got thrown off except that it might have been because of the attempt to connect to the Echo Dot. So frustrating!The kicker? I had my father take this Echo Dot to his home and try it and you know what? It worked just fine. He also has Comcast Xfinity, except he has an Android and I have an iPhone.Moral of the story- Comcast and iPhone? Move cautiously. I used to think Amazon could do no wrong, now I think twice.	1	December 7, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Not what I expected but than again I may have not programmed it right not good with these tech stuff it stays off most the time and when called it doesn't answer gotta push one of the buttons to make it come out but I still have it...	3	January 5, 2020	1

Echo Dot	It was working well until this weekend.  It just stopped working.  I can't charge, reset or anything.  No power to the device.  Even though I only paid .99 for it (with the $7.99 monthly music fee) I still feel it should work for more than a month	3	December 2, 2019	1

Echo Dot	I really love the echo devices and have used a few in the past but one thing I've always had in common is difficulty in pairing. It always seems to be a different issue but eventually works just trying the same thing over and over. Otherwise, amazing product. Hopefully they figure out the pairing better	3	October 15, 2019	1
Echo Dot	A lot of issues using any other products besides amazon. It has many issues with Apple Music and Alexa app with Apple integration. Very frustrating	3	September 26, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Challenging to integrate with other dots and echo products. Almost impossible to integrate on shared multiple family member account.  All echo, Alexa products don‚Äôt work together.  Recommend Amazon adding a echo home type station to connect and integrate everything to and manage from.	3	February 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It can‚Äôt hear me when the music is playing. I wanted it to play music when I‚Äôm crafting in the garage. I have to wait between songs so it can hear me. Even if I yell. If I get a phone call I can‚Äôt get it to stop the music until song is over.	1	May 9, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Needs more work on intagration. Also bought an Alexa Show which is not compatible with Netflix.  Also a bit disappointed with the recent push for prime music unlimited. Already paying for prime but unlimited music is a me too competitor to spotify... Non value added.	3	January 27, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The review is a one because after 6 months of using it. It broke on me. The sound quality was great and it was nice having music in the house to dance to with the kids.It was kept up and safely away from the kiddos. And worked great, but all of a sudden just stopped working. No idea why it stopped working, it just kept loading. Or it wouldn‚Äôt recognize what I was asking it to do. Even if I used the app for it. I would avoid paying for this honestly. I just got another one but it was free with a tv. Hopefully it doesn‚Äôt break on me.	1	October 16, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Tell me if i'm missing something but isn't this just a glorified speaker for my spotify (which i already have)?Seems super buggy compared to Google Home, constantly doesn't understand my requests, plays different things to what i ask, just seems very very limited and i didn't own 1st or 2nd Gen but god they must have been bang average.Also, how this doesn't have an internal battery for ease of placement around the house i'll never know, HUGE design flaw needing to be constantly wired into power.I expected so much more from this, disappointing purchase and i assume the interns worked on this project, shame.	2	February 14, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The concept is really cool but I cant really find a whole lot of use for this yet. I have to buy a bunch of other stuff to have a complete integration with home. At this time setting alarms and I guess listening to music is cool.	3	January 9, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I was very excited to get this. During the set up she answered all of the questions I asked. But the next morning when I tried to get the morning routine she wouldn't answer. this went on about 3 days and then one morning she spoke I was so excited. But she has not answered me since.  I'm not sure if this is something about me or if something is wrong with Alexa. Any help would be appreciated.	2	October 29, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I've bought 20 echo dots from1st to 4th gen she has an aditude does what ever she wants I can never link her to another to get whole home synced music. I have no accent I speak clearly no urban slang yet she still can understand perfect English also she will lie about the number of annual deaths from the Flu that number on average is roughly 80000 give or take few thousand ppl . Asked her the question around 02/02/2020 answer 60k again in April 2020 answer 40k august 2020 20k then I asked Samuel L Jackson right after and he answered 80000 deaths in US. Last report 2019. She can not be trusted!!!!	1	September 17, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Cleans ok. Has a Max suction setting that seems to be a lot better than standard. This thing was a pain in the a$$ to set up. Does not run on 5ghz. I basically had to set up a 2nd network just for the vac	3	February 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"They work but now everytime you ask Alexa to do anything, it says ""OK, by the way, did you know Alexa can do......"" And the tells you about something it can do. Every time. Google it and you'll come across forums. You pretty much have to disable everything to shut it up. My 11 y/o son wants to turn his bedroom light off at bedtime, he gets a ""by the way, did you know Alexa can help you find your phone?"" Or some random skill. Set a reminder, same thing, ask the weather, same thing. Now I had to turn off all responses so all it's does is ding if spoken to. Total waste. They ruined it pushing their paid stuff. I am trashing these and going with their competitors."	1	May 13, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Normally the products are grest my husband has worked for amazon for over 5 years but the thing wouldnt even turn on. Im not sure if its a maintenance problem or what. Super disappointing since we got it for my office to hv some methods of relaxing & releasing stress	1	May 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Amazon music doesnt have the selection that spotify has to constantly have to go to spotify. It was a little difficult to get started . The sound on it is ok the higher u raise the volume the worst it sounds so I keep it low...I thinks it's ok for the price	3	November 11, 2019	1
Echo Dot	We have 2, and I was very disappointed when I found out we can't listen to music on both at the same time. I got the second one for my husbands shop, He love to listen to music and I like to listen to music as I work.	3	December 26, 2019	1
Echo Dot	i love using it but it goes off alone at like 3 am and im a baby who cries every time it does. but beside it always recognize some demon voice it is really helpful and does many task like set times which is bomb	3	January 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The 3rd gen echo sacrifices sound quality for volume. Alexa sound muffled like shes taking with a blanket stuffed in her mouth and you have to raise the volume very loud to understand her. This is the same on both of the echos I ordered. Where as alexia speaks crystal clear on the 2and gen. For me this is a down grade not an upgrade very disappointed. However music can be played loud and the muffling is less noticeable so if your just looking for a generic bluetooth speaker with s limited set of alexa abilities this is ok..	2	May 10, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I switched to a Alexa from a google and I wish I would‚Äôve just stayed with the google,it works good but google is just better cheaper has more features and u can get more out of google but not Alexa it‚Äôs just problems after problem.	3	January 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Right out of the box at setup, I noticed the voice was bad quality. Then tried to play music and same thing. Looks like something is loose inside of it or the speaker itself is broke. Even on very low volume, it will make a crackling sound. Not suitable at all for me. I can‚Äôt replace for the same item, don‚Äôt know why. I really would like to start on Alexa speakers and gadgets, but that was a bad introduction.	1	February 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Hard to get them each to work. Bought a few. But don't need Big Brother listening in. Crappy internet here so barely would work.	3	September 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Really saw zero difference in sound quality or performance. If you have an older dot, no reason to upgrade.	3	November 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs good for asking the weather, and for my kids to tell Alexa to play music but that‚Äôs about all she does. I guess I just don‚Äôt know all the capabilities, I feel like she should be able to do more for us. Not incredibly impressed.	3	January 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It works, kinda.... some of the skills are clunky.  Spotify rarely works.	3	February 2, 2021	1
Echo Dot	So I am not sure what it all does I know I can say play holiday music, make a list beyond that I am not sure and I don't use it much.  So I can't really say I am thrilled with it and I can't say I'm not.	3	December 10, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I have been resistant to anything voice activated. I pretty much hate Siri, Cortana, and anything along those lines.  But, I am really tired of dealing with an armload of remotes, just to watch TV.  The one thing that I really wanted Alexa to do, was control the Roku...and she just won't do it. It worked once, the first day I set up the skill, and it took a while. Every day since, she just tells me to use the remote for Roku. Humph, that's what I bought you for.	2	July 2, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I loved this when I got it, but then Amazon decided to step in because I was using it too much to play my music.  I was working from home and was playing music, but about every 45 min to 1 hour it would shut off.  I thought it was broken.  Nope, Amazon is controlling  how long you can listen to your music.  If there is no activity, then the music shuts off.  What???  So they are monitoring it, according to Amazon (I called them).  I unplugged and put it away, along with my Echo.  I think Amazon owes me a partial refund for my membership and a refund for my devices.  DO NOT BUY THESE DEVICES UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE MONITORED.	1	April 20, 2021	0
Echo Dot	You give her request some time and she shut off and it really ashamed you have to buy unlimited music to listen to your favorite music I mean the music should come free I mean you purchased the dot to basically to hear your favorite music	3	January 24, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I was very impressed on how easy it was to set up. I was also impressed on how quick it was to respond back to you. I was not impressed with Alexa's voice. It was so muffled that I could only understand about 10% of what she was saying. This would be a 5 star if Alexa had a more clear crisp voice. I am 68 years old and at this age clear crisp voices are really needed. I will try gen 4 when it comes out if they have fixed Alexa's voice.	2	June 23, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I've decided to return this Alexa. I've had too many problems with this from the get go. One of the main reasons I purchased this was to take it with me on business trips & vacation trips. Which i discovered cannot connect to the hotel internet, as it's public. It must be a private connection. Which I didn't find out until a few days ago. I took it to the manager of the hotel & after he tried to sign in, he discovered this.Secondly, I wanted to be able to listen to our music in the room, but it doesn't work in the room. Now I  find out you have to subscribe & pay a monthly fee to Amazon for the privilege of listening, even though I pay Amazon a fee monthly for your prime service.I am extremely disappointed  with the services with Amazon & better that I've NOT received.	1	October 25, 2020	0
Echo Dot	It works fine for answering questions.  I was just disappointed with the sound quality when listening to music.  The feature of being able to request any type of music you'd like to hear is great, but if that is what you plan to use it for you probably need a better quality echo or other speakers	3	August 25, 2019	1
Echo Dot	At first it connected to Our Directv , but now it won‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt have any smart things in the house, we just ask questions.	3	September 12, 2020	1

Echo Dot	one thing alexa did that i didn‚Äôt like was not play the music i requested.. i would ask her to play a song and she would go silent as if she was searching for the song but be searching for what felt like forever.	3	February 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I GAVE ONLY THREE STARS DUE TO HAVING TO USE A DEDICATED WALL WART WITH THIS NEW VERSION OF DOT. THE FUNCTION OF THE UNIT WOULD BE 5 STARS OTHER THAN THAT. THE PREVIOUS  VERSION USE A USB CABLE THAT I MUCH PREFER.	3	February 2, 2020	1

Echo Dot	This was a free promotional gift from another item I bought recently. I really didn't want to use it but the support Tech that was working on my new fire stick issue said it would fix the problem. Figure the odds on that! My fire stick still has the issue and Alexa is back in the box where it belongs.  I have no intention of talking to my TV just to be asked another question by a machine that keeps repeating itself. After 45 minutes on two different occasions on the phone with Amazon support I was pissed off to no end dealing with this BS. The programming fire stick offers is great, I am a Prime member and really happy with what's offered with the fire stick . All I want is to be able to turn my TV on and off with tha button on the remote.  Stay away from the echo dot, it's not worth the trouble or it's eavesdropping capabilities. Now that I think of it, the Alexa options on the remote doesn't work either.	1	February 16, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"I have (had) no less than 15 Alexa and Fire items in my house In which we enjoyed.  This is a great expense and I  trusted Amazon would not breach this trust by listening in to my household.  After your removing P*rler from your web servers can I trust you with access to my private household and office?  I  have wasted my money.  I have discussed this with others who feel like we cannot trust Amazon not to spy.  If you will do this to your customers, who trusted and believed in you,  what what wont you do if you don't agree with them?  Whats funny I said to myself when I allowed this in my house ""I don't have anything to hide"" well now I'm not sure that make any difference at all."	1	January 15, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt like that it seemingly turns on when I‚Äôm not commanding it. It‚Äôs happened a few times, and I‚Äôm not enjoying that feature. Sound quality is better by far than the last gen.

Echo Dot	The 3rd generation Alexa is so much better looking than the 2nd generation version. Setup is also greatly improved.It's unfortunately not possible to say the same about the huge power supply.

Echo Dot	It was entertaining and weird at the same time! Nevertheless, it is helpful!	3	January 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The show is obviously a much better choice. This one is glitchy and i think the price tells you why. If your listening to sleep sounds this one will shut off after about  45 minutes and wont stay going all night. The show does this one shuts off you streaming music after an hour on its own. The show doesnt. The thing i dont like most is you have to say things exactly right or she doesnt know ehat your wanting. Example if you want her to stop playing a sound you say alexa stop playing that sound or song. She wont get it you just have to say alexa stop. Its all in the details as to how you tell her sonething.	2	September 15, 2019	0

Echo Dot	It is hard to know exactly what Alexa can do. There should be a manual of her capabilities. I think I expected more than what I'm getting but I am good with most of the stuff that she does. I'm sure the Dot is a powerful tool, but I'm not sure how to unleash the power.	3	August 30, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"After having several echo dot speakers for about a month, I must say that I find them both handy and annoying. They are handy for adding things to my shopping lists quickly and they're pretty good as speakers. HOWEVER...they have light rings that don't turn off and they will occasionally make little sounds (maybe when internet connection is going in and out but I'm not really sure what the sound is supposed to mean). This makes them terrible for bedrooms if you want to get any sleep. Also, if you have children be warned that your children will find it hilarious to turn on Alexa's burping skill or to tell her that they farted so that she will tell them ""Congratulations!"" Yeah, that's super annoying as a mom."	2	August 10, 2019	0

Echo Dot	The sound is ok.  I think my Google assistant might have better sound.The Alexa Dot plays more commercials during the news than the Google News!!  I‚Äôm even paying for Amazon music unlimited!!  You think there would be no commercials during the news :(Also you can‚Äôt cancel the Amazon Music subscription on your phone app.  WTFI had to log onto my account via computer to cancel, so I got stuck pay for another month of Amazon music!!!!	1	January 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Design is good. Still trying to figure out app. Not so easy without detailed instructions. HOW TO is pretty vague. My real difficulty is with voice sound. It is very difficult to understand words. Sound is muffled. I have reduced base as far as it will go and no difference. Music is ok, but I have better on wireless speakers connected to laptop or mp3.	2	February 27, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Like:  small size, integrationDislike:  keeps falling off the dashboard or the vent!  So I stopped using it because it becomes distracting.  The provided usb cable is shortA wireless unit would be ideal to use in a vehicle.	3	January 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I should have researched this more because I didn't realize it had to be plugged in all the time.  I was hoping I could move it around the house without having to plug it in all the time.  Otherwise I'm enjoying it.	3	January 13, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I got this with the special offer they were having for 99c. I figured I could try it out before buying more. Alexa only recognizes that she is being spoken to a small percentage of the time. Some of the music that we asked for, it repeated the correct title but then played a different song. The only thing that it has been useful for is the alarm. Even that though only has so many selections for the sound. I was excited about the celebrity alarm but then there wasn't any that I even would have used. I thought maybe there would be celebrities like Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Anniston, so forth. The sound quality is great for such a little device when you can actually get the music to play. I am still learning how to configure it. That can be a good thing or not. Good because it gives you a little bit of a challenge but then at the same time I could miss out on some cool setting or skill. I am sure that I will have more later as I mess around with it.	1	December 17, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I have had this device for a little over a month and since then i have had to unplug it to reboot it because it freezes and doesn't respond to anything, bot even the push of a button. After we unplug it and back in it works just fine.	3	November 15, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Even a small  brief power interuption messes up the Echo Dot.  It needs to be reset all the time.  Annoying!	3	September 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I‚Äôm actually kinda disappointed in the lack of voice recognition from Alexa at times and I find myself screaming at her repeatedly over a simple command she should be able to understand. Like how many times must I hear that error sound and her message of lack of understanding. Also why is my sound glitching out? Like the speaker is about to blow or something ? Also I‚Äôve had to unplug and replug several times to reset her as the music will become broken and in and out of sound and when you try to have her pause she won‚Äôt even recognize the Alexa command to do so. I‚Äôm hoping maybe I just got a bad one and I can get a replacement but the programming is what it is.. but like the sound and the glitching after only little of a month and half shows this dot is not music friendly for daily use. I really think it may be a speaker issue at times or maybe it‚Äôs a glitch in the music after playing for so long.	1	March 2, 2020	0

Echo Dot	The product works ok, however when using the Drop In feature the volume is to low which makes it difficult to understand and I haven‚Äôt found a way to adjust it on the Alexa app? I have two Gen 2 dots and 2 gen 3 dots. This problem needs to be addressed.	3	October 8, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"We all knew the endgame was for Echo to serve as an advertisement delivery system for Amazon. Just sad it happened so fast.

Echo Dot	"I find that quite a few of Alexa's replies are ""I don't know that"" for questions that aren't that complicated. It takes away from the usefulness of having this device.

Echo Dot	I have 10 of these devices at my home and work. Initially, they are wonderful. I had no complaints until the speakers just started failing. They were working perfect, then the next morning, the speaker would light up like Alexa was responding but no sound came out. It is as if the speaker connection came loose in the device. You can tap on the bottom of the device and get it to make a sound, but it is like a static sound. No music plays. I contacted Amazon, and they told me that the devices come with a Limited warranty. They would credit my account for 15% off a new device. These devices are both about 6 months old. My others are still working good for now. I will still buy more of these, but am not happy about the longevity of the product at all.	1	November 20, 2020	0

Echo Dot	We were really satisfied with our Echo speakers but Alexa become quite a dummy over last year. On both devices we have, she often plays different things than requested, lags, doesn't understand simplest commands, losts wifi. 2 years ago it was a hit.

Echo Dot	This is literally a paperweight because I'm not given access to the app and they don't offer the ability to operate via a pc.

I am aware that updating to the newer iOS' can cause serious issues or shut down your phone, so I avoid them and my phones been great.

Echo Dot	What can I say? Amazon electronics seem to be made with less and less care or quality. The original echo dot that we own now sounds terrible and has fuzzy feedback anytime Alexa is speaking. The sound quality on this newer generation is not much better and we've only had it for a few weeks. I'll come back and update this review once the speaker has degraded to the condition of our original echo dot. the only time I purchase these anymore is when they're available for 99 cents on some BS promo Amazon's running.

Echo Dot	I ordered one echo dot and worked with amazon customer service because when we asked to play specific music Alexa would consistently play the wrong song. We use the echo dot in a school and she would frequently play inappropriate music which was unacceptable. Customer service was unable to fix the problem so I returned the product and ordered a new one.  I installed the new one today and the same issue occurred. If you plan on connecting your echo dot to your spotify account and want to listen to specific music, don't order one, because it will play whatever it wants.	2	February 3, 2020	0
Echo Dot	So the google home mini beats the echo dot in my opinion by a long shot. This is good only to integrate with Amazon's website but with google home mini you have everything alexa has but add the search engine capabilities and syncs with google calendar, reminders and alarms also can track flights prices for certain travel periods and send them to your email. The alexa is okay but compared to the google home mini it just doesnt stand a chance. Also I got two light bulbs for the same price as alexa from kholes hence Alexa went back and google home mini rules my house.	2	January 7, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Stick with the Google Home - so much more intuitive and functional. Especially if you want it to use it to search for anything on the web, such as answering questions. Or to integrate it with other smart technology throughout your home. It's constantly making errors, unable to find the information we're looking for or just not working and giving us the Alexa version of the spinning color wheel. We received this with our Ring security system, which in theory would be great together, but in reality, it can't do even simple things you would expect from a smart home security system. For example, we want to use it in to control the light on our outdoor motion camera when we're outside at night, but it isn't capable. Amazon needs to do a serious upgrade of its software technology on the Echo dot, and they need to partner with Google so they can actually use their web search engine.	1	July 8, 2020	0

Echo Dot	The speaker is better but everything else is worse.  My original dot was better at detecting my voice (sometimes have to yell at this one).  This dot also sometimes beeps like I set a timer when it was actually a reminder which means I don't get the reminder unless I check my phone and also it is annoying when the timer sound is going off when it shouldn't.  Sometimes blinks with a blue ring randomly and only way to get it to stop is to power cycle the device.  I am really considering junking this one and going back to my old echo dot.	2	December 18, 2019	0
Echo Dot	The dot came free with something else and I don't plug it in very often. It works fine as a multiple kitchen timer or to answer questions about the weather. The sound quality isn't great for listening to music.	3	February 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Got this with the free light bulb.  Tried set up for an hour and nothing	3	November 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I'm so sick of hearing a lengthy description of things I can do or suggestions... It constantly just wants me to buy...The speaker quality is good, but everytime you connect it has to say what it's connected too.. often startingly loud.I just don't find it as effective as my google system and after the last few times just trying to use them I've given up on Alexa and am giving my devices away.  This is now a Google Home.	1	January 9, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Hollow  sound  on voice for gen 3 gen 2 voice sounds better gen 3 sounds better for music	3	September 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This echo device, 3rd gen, doesn't keep the volume set. Having to constantly raise the volume. I like my 2nd gen echo better.	3	August 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"Sound volume seems an improvement.Poor voice response compared to last version. Have to repeat or speak clearly and directly. ""blue ring"" voice indicator often spins irradically and can't recognize direction of voice command.Also, answers more often when talking to Google Home Assistance in the same room.  With wake word of ""echo"" it often responds when I'm asking Google the weather or some innocuous request.Sound has more of a bass sound but fidelity now lacking and dificult to understand vocals as well.Locating it in a different place may get a better response."	2	February 20, 2020	0
Echo Dot	works ok but found out you can only listen to one music stream at a time so little value if you are in two locations in your home unwilling to pay 14.00 just for that privalege	3	March 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Music randomly turns off. Sometimes after 4( minutes. Sometimes an hour and Alexa tells me it‚Äôs because there has been no activity for several hours.	3	July 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Echo was easy to install, quality seems good my only gripes are related to the music playing, if you raise the volume up around 7, it starts to distort. Excellent performance for a small speaker all in all,  Besides that it‚Äôs great .	3	December 11, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I would like it more if it consistly worked. Got it for Christmas present, put it in my kitchen about a month ago, found that it just quits working randomly. Don't know if I got a lemon or what.	3	February 5, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Took forever to connect and integrate. It eerily responded to YouTubes playing on an IPad mini from 10 feet across the rim on medium volume.There is no way to trust it‚Äôs not listening to what‚Äôs going on in my home, so I‚Äôve relegated the trope to playing outside when I‚Äôm gardening.	2	June 18, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Only problem I have with this is the sound sounds like a transiter radio no bass or treble. I bought it on black friday when they was 22.00 I wonder if these are the refurbished ones is why they was so cheap.	3	December 31, 2019	1

Echo Dot	Every time you ask a question or give a command it  answers or completes command then continues to suggest what to do next. It does this every time with no way to turn it off without turning it on child mode. I just want it to turn off my light not tell me that it can turn it off at a set time every time I ask it to turn it off. Alexa shut up is my most used command	1	January 18, 2022	0
Echo Dot	My first Gen Echo when told to play music does so and offers huge menu of songs and very little commercial interruptions.  My 2nd Gen Echo which is down stairs is a Pain in the neck.  ITs wired to some other program format and you get limited music and lots of commercials.  I'd rather have the first Gen Echo...far better service and less hassle.  First Gen will play no cost music and 2nd Gen is making that a real tooth ache to happen.	1	December 19, 2021	0

Echo Dot	I will be telling her something or asking, but she goes off on something I hadn't mentioned. It can get annoying and I have to unplug it to reset it basically. overall though I do enjoy it.	3	February 26, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I just picked one of these up to see what it could do. I personally found it unnecessary and kind of an annoyance which is why it found it‚Äôs way to the laundry room. I had issues with connectivity problems to the Wi-Fi when none of my other electronics were connected and sometimes it just didn't want to talk at all. Besides that I found it intrusive with the beeping and lights especially when it had unnecessary messages which is all the time. For all my electronics I ask myself whether it makes my more simple or more complicated so the Echo got the boot.	2	January 3, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Only problem I have with this speaker is the voice. It has very muffled voice, which is some time very difficult to understand.	3	August 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It doesn't work when I try to connect it to my TV (LG smart tv). I tried a lot of things and nothingfe, I called for support and did every step that they told me and NOTHING! I need help!!!!!!!!	3	January 19, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"The first thing I asked for was a song.  The reply was "" starting at $4.99 per month billed directly to my account I can access over 70 million songs from the catalog.  I never got to hear the song or several others that I asked for.  I just kept getting the pitch.  When I asked something else, the reply was would I like to have a gift sent and billed directly to my account.  I know nothing is free but the only thing I heard was $$$$$.  Total waste of time.  It was a gift so I will probably re-gift it to somebody.  Maybe it will be of some help or service to them."	1	April 28, 2021	0
Echo Dot	So the best they can do is tell you to uninstall whatever the problem is and reinstall it.Else they swap you out to Sujit or Sahil or some other tech person who has no tech skills other than to read from their script to tell you basically to Unplug and Plug back in.  I mean Amazon Alexa has a problem with finding Amazon Prime when my streaming device is enables on the App.Spent entirely too much time A. explaining this to the CSA  B. RE-EXPLAINING because they swapped out to another 'customer support' individual, and C. having a third and fourth person tell me to Unplug and reinstall the access.I used to think Amazon was a technology company.... now I know better	1	February 22, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Despite the claims that the sound quality is improved, the reality is that the 3rd gen Dot does a very poor, very muddy voicing compared to the 2nd generation.  I returned/exchanged the first one I recieved, thinking it was defective, but the replacement is just about the same.  The audio adjustments for the device only adjust the sound when playing music, and do not apply to Alexa's voice.	2	October 28, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Alexa is very useful, I love her features.  Setting her up isn't the easiest, but other than that she's alright.	3	August 23, 2020	1
Echo Dot	BE CAREFUL while ordering this , especially if you click the ‚Äúfree light bulb‚Äù option . I went through hell & back to get the light bulb that was supposed to be included with the speaker . I had to fight with Amazon and go through supervisors and everything just to get the light bulb that they say IS INCLUDED & FREE . They tried to make me pay for separate light bulbs until I was transferred to the Alex department and they sent me credit to order a new light I shouldn‚Äôt have had to do that though if it gives me a option to select a free light bulb I should just get it when I got my speaker but that wasn‚Äôt the case üôÑ now I have to wait another week for a separate light bulb. #ANNOYING	1	December 5, 2020	0

Echo Dot	It has some nice features, but is always trying to upsell you on buying new things. Want to listen to a song?  Alexa spends 10 seconds asking if you want premium unlimited music. Want to listen to white noise?  You can get premium white noise if you only upgrade. So damn annoying, and you can't turn off the ads.  Thinking of just deleting my alexa device.	2	December 1, 2020	0

Echo Dot	I honestly couldn't figure out what dot did aside from make questions button free. Dot recognized that i had 2 fire sticks in the house and that 2 tvs were also present but could control none of it. It connected to my speaker via bluetooth but couldnt turn the volume up or down. After the 3rd time of asking alexa what she could do, i gave up and decided this wasn't worth the money spent. It seemed like a great deal at first but doesn't do anything my fire stick couldn't do before. At least nothing that pertains to my life and current belongings.	2	January 2, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"This thing sucks. It never responds to anything that I ask it to do. ""Alexa, turn on the light""....... nothing......""Alexa, what time is it?""......nothing.... it doesn't do anything other than sit there and collect dust. I ""upgraded"" from the original first generation to this thinking it could only get better. I was wrong. At least my first generation one would turn my light on when I asked it to. I can't even set reminders or alarms anymore because it literally never responds to anything I say, it just lights up and then turns right back off. No response. At all. Everrrr."	1	October 8, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I cannot recommend this (or another other) Echo device.Everything worked fine for a while. And then everything started misbehaving. I have spent so, so many hours trying everything you can think of to fix it, and I've spent many hours on the phone with Amazon technicians. I can tell you this: If you search the internet for Alexa problems, you will discover that there are millions of people out there having exactly the same problems, and they've been having those problems for years, and Amazon cannot fix them. This will end up driving you crazy. Try the google products. I haven't used them, but they can't be worse than these.	1	July 26, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"These are some of the most unreliable electronic devices that I've ever owned... I've had nothing but problems with them since the beginning. They are difficult to setup and even more difficult to use from setting simple alarms, to damn near impossible to setup a routine to automatically turn lights on and off.Alexa constantly goes on about, ""I'm having problems understanding"" and takes more than an hour until you can use it again. They are constantly having connection issues when we a strong internet signal through out the house.I purchased 5 of them and have problems with every single one of them. I thought by resetting them and starting over would eliminate the problems but now... they won't even reconnect to anything. So in the trash they all go.I'd buy ANYTHING else other than Alexa if you want your stuff to actually work."	1	September 14, 2020	0

Echo Dot	If your the type of person that ask 50 million  questions or want to know information  about off the wall stuff. Then Alexa is not for you. Her added skills only help her out so much befor she feels useless. On the other hand using her for controlling your home is nice and simple. Getting her to recognize  your voice and speaking pattern is aggravating especially when you have a speech impediment.Over all the product is not bad I use this little dot for music and I really love the sound quality differently  one of the best music quality wise.	2	December 23, 2019	0

Echo Dot	"After reading the glowing description, we thought the newer Dots would work a whole lot better. True, the music sounds somewhat less like a transistor radio, but now, the audio quality is muffled and muddy, even after adjusting the tone controls.The voice recognition remains abominably poor, as does the responsiveness of the device, itself. Should I really have to bellow in my moderate sized kitchen to get a response? No, I don't think so. We'd hoped the ""improved"" mics would perform better, but no dice.I suggest you save your money, folks. Who knows? Genuine improvements might be down the road."	2	December 15, 2019	0

Worst of all they tempered with my review to give the most favorable because they didn't like my last one this is corrupt corruption greed at it best please fix this dam thing and stop lying to your customers by leaving out the truth that this device needs a new or upgraded AI i am so sick an tired of all these lies the sound equity how ever can be favorable at times if it wasn't for the AI messing with me causing stress the speaker would be at least worth the discount price. Amazon please fix these insane irrational issues and don't temper with this review 4 stars i don't think so.	1	November 2, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Sound quality is a little disappointing.	3	March 27, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Complete rubbish. I was excited to try this out. Hopefully a decent little Bluetooth speaker. I plugged it in to discover it‚Äôs completely useless to me. I live off grid in an area with no internet access and a barely there cell connection. I couldn‚Äôt use the echo dot without the Alexa app. I couldn‚Äôt download the app. So I had to wait till I left for town and could leech WiFi to download the app. I tried again but the app can‚Äôt set up the damn speaker without WiFi. I can‚Äôt pair it to my Bluetooth without first setting it up in the app. I‚Äôm completely stuck with an over expensive speaker I can‚Äôt even use. Rubbish.	1	May 21, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Received this as a Christmas gift with great expectation only to be disappointed. My original Echo is great with zero complaint. I wanted the Dot to be an addition I could place in another room. However, the Dot does NOT have the same features as the Echo. For example, I cannot make a playlist. Nor, can I request any specific artists' music to be played without purchasing Amazon Unlimited Music package.I'm a prime member and should be able to receive all prime benefits as with my original Echo without having to purchase anything more. I did the troubleshooting as instructed, to no avail. Very, very disappointed with the Dot. Its reputation is not all that. I'm glad it was a gift.

Echo Dot	The wife and I primarily use this product to interact with our home and give us weather. We have an echo in most rooms.

Echo Dot	"Decent speaker.  Convenient size.  More bass than some, but at the sacrifice of clear highs. But what do you expect for under $30?  Not portable - it needs to be plugged in, which is limiting.  And it talks constantly, announcing things like ""Now connected to - whoever's - iPhone"" whenever you walk into the room...which gets really old after a while.  (Turns out there is NO WAY to turn that off!  I assumed it was just user error, but no.)  Frankly, I like my wife's Tribit XSound Go better, for a similar price.

We have a large collection of albums on our personal computer that is TOTALLY INVISIBLE to Alexa's world. Do not waste your money if you have a similar situation.	2	January 24, 2021	0
Echo Dot	When asking a question, most of the time can not give me an answer.	3	October 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I originally got echo so I could hook up voice assistant light bulbs but turns out my wifi isn't compatible, but on the other hand. Alexa just doesn't compare to Google. When asking most questions we just get the response; "" I don't know that "". Very disappointing honestly"	2	July 8, 2021	0
Echo Dot	The sound is pretty disappointing. I‚Äôm hard of hearing and I have to keep the sound turned up almost all the way. I plugged in some external speakers to the 3.5 mm port, and the sound became worse, not better. Research has shown that this is very much an issue‚Ä¶ External speakers attached through 3.5mm jack have horrible volume and there is absolutely no Amazon support for fixing this.	2	November 17, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Alexa responds with more words than necessary.  Sound has less sharp, clear notes than I would expect.	3	September 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The offer said Prime members get 2 Echos for $39.98, but I only received one. =(	3	October 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The echo dot would be great if the voice model setup worked, it insists the room is too loud despite being in complete silence, customer support was altogether unhelpful, and frustrating	3	April 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I was very excited about this at first and really after the initial use there is very little use for it. The biggest value it has at this point is telling me the weather or playing the music. Okay, half the time it can‚Äôt even find my city, so I waste time repeating myself and it sending an error. The music is way more frustrating. Get this - on Apple Music, there is no way to shuffle the music. Imagine how annoying it is to constantly play the same playlist from your Apple Music and have to listen to it in the same sequence every time! No option to shuffle!! I‚Äôm annoyed I bought two for 30 each but I am seriously about to just throw them both away and give up. They seriously suck. I never write reviews either. Don‚Äôt buy them.	1	October 23, 2020	0
Echo Dot	destorted when playing music	2	February 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	We are still transitioning but overall we like it. I get far better results linking it to my phone than getting Alexa to figure out my commands. Sound quality is good enough for four stars but barely.	3	February 4, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Positive...Recognized voice commands most of the time. Negative... recognized voice commands most of the time.	3	October 17, 2020	1
Echo Dot	So my daughter was being silly and asked Alexa to make a fart noise. She made a fart noise and then my daughter asked her again them she didn‚Äôt answer her instead Alexa says come close, my daughter says huh Alexa says come closer so you can feel the warmth of my‚Ä¶. And i didnt hear the the last part. I was in shock and unplugged her and was totally freaked out.	1	February 4, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I totally dislike the advertisement about Floyd!!!!!!!  What about the retired Policeman that was killed by the rioters?  Why no mention of him???  He was black, but a decent human being.  Honest, hardworking, loved this country. The least you could do is tell the truth instead of lying to us.. Trying to lead us around by the rings in our noses. Gheeez.  Oh, and I do like being able to listen to the music.  Nice sound.	2	June 20, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The sound is good when listening to music but when Alexa is talking she sounds like she‚Äôs in another room and it‚Äôs bassy , the voice cannot be adjusted with the eq only the music can please fix !	3	January 11, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The echo dot sometime do not respond to my question, sometimes the only it will answer me by the app on my phone  and some time that don‚Äôt work have to keep repeating the question.	3	February 16, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Like the product but, i am having a lot of difficulty distinguishing between home and office in direct locations.  Office Echo forced me to set up a new account and now i cant access the primary home account.  Lost the ability to use the shopping list feature of the family Alexa after i set up my office Alexa.	2	February 27, 2021	0
Echo Dot	This would get more stars from me but the voice recognition is really bad. Sounds good when playing music, though	3	August 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I cant use it outside USA properly, i am in south Am√©rica and it doesn't recognize the map or the traffic neither the weather in celcius. It does speak Spanish but I can't  completely use it here in Peru.	3	December 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I have multiple echo dots in my house. My most recent dot purchase was in late September, 2020. It has been 9 months of me owning this thing and it has completely died. Tried different outlets, used a different power cord, the thing won‚Äôt even light up (I have no children, so it‚Äôs not like this thing gets beat up or ran over- it stays plugged into the wall, untouched, every day). Customer service was not helpful in any way either, I have received better service from sooo many other companies. I am just overall disappointed in the quality of life of this product. I expected better from Amazon.	1	July 30, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Wish this speaker was as good as the Sonos speaker. It‚Äôs like playing music from my iPad. The quality is ok for a small area. Voice recognition for Alexa takes a long time and will play music I didn‚Äôt request.	3	December 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	Amazon really knows how to screw a good thing up. Older version seems to work fine next generation is just awful. I have to ask it multiple times to do the simplest tasks like play music. It will randomly stop playing music for no reason and when I ask it to stop playing music it will just start playing music randomly a few minutes later. I asked for news it gets me whether I asked for whether it plays music I will ask you the same question five times and it will do four different things. Absolute garbage! Edit: did you know that if you leave a bad review for an Amazon product they start blowing up your phone at work and spamming you with unsolicited calls? Loose my number idiots! You made a crap product stop trying to put that on me! Horrible experience with the Amazon tablet as well. Same thing happened, I try to return it and they just make it so difficult and spam you all week. They act like it's operator error, but it is their products that are deficient.	1	September 18, 2019	0
Echo Dot	The volume for alarms will not go up loud enough even when set on highest level. Volume is fine with other tasks.	3	July 26, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I am a member of Amazon music.  When I tried to play my songs on the Dot , I was told there would be additional charges.  So I  disconnected Amazon Dot and let it collect dust.	3	January 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Hard to set up! Very intimidating..thank God for ur costumer service.	3	December 30, 2020	1
Echo Dot	We love Alexa but it keeps dropping the Internet connection.  From my research it has something to do with have dual internet (5G) but it is not intuitive on how to resolve the issue.  It has nothing to do with proximity to internet source because it‚Äôs very close.  Also no other devices including a google home have the issue.  Is it a lemon unit?  It‚Äôs hard to rationalize buying another when we have to struggle with it almost every night.	2	May 22, 2020	0
Echo Dot	I don't like that you can't use more than one at a time unless they all play the same thing...unless you pay for yet another monthly subscription.  Had I known that, I would have left all 5 behind.	3	January 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Reconditioned DOT needs more conditioning.  Flashes purple and nothing else.  Also all my other DOTs can‚Äôt hear you when a fan or running water is nearby.	3	May 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Love this! We have lots of fun with Alexa! Worth the buy!	3	December 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It works okay but haven‚Äôt noticed much of a difference in response time and understanding me. I feel like I have to repeat myself multiple times.	3	June 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	We've not used Alexa before, so I imagine part of the frustration is our own learning curve. Nonetheless, it's laughable how often she says, 'Sorry, I didn't get that' and the nonsense answers to questions are almost as bad as Siri. Integrating our 2 Bose speakers has been impossible thus far, but we persevere. Better luck with the smart lightbulbs which work as advertised. The volume level seems to change by itself. We were considering getting 1-2 more to cover our house more completely, but this first one has been disappointing and making us wonder whether to bother.	2	January 31, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Sometimes I tell her to do something or play a song she does some thing else or she doesn't know it.  But I love my Alexa I think I have to find out how to work with it still	3	December 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	√ötil en cierta manera	3	April 14, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I like the size and the ease of use, so far. I need to learn more of its functions.But when I mute it, after awhile it will start to chime. So I  have just unplugged it.	3	January 15, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Its not tesponsive as i thought. U really have to shout to understand you. I was using it in my garage.	3	July 31, 2020	1
Echo Dot	When I turn the volume past 5 it starts to get distorted and has a crackling noise,it just sits in my computer room and doesn't get used,I dont have time to repackage and send back.	3	February 23, 2020	1
