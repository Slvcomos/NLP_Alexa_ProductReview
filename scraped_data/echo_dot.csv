Echo Dot	Muy buen producto	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I love Alexa Echo dot. She has a great range of music and and information. Great for mapping out your schedule, timers, mediation music and all types of playlist	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I dislike it doesn't do teaching like math, skills, but over all it's great	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Every day I try to use it and it says it can‚Äôt connect to ‚Äúpublic Wi-Fi‚Äù. Only way to fix is to crawl under my desk and unplug it. At least they should have a reset button given how badly they are made.	1	October 25, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I was never a fun of the echo but I must admit I‚Äôm very impressed with echo I love it and suggest this for anyone.	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Love the way it responds so quickly to my voice	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I now have 4 echo dots in 4 different rooms. It was my preference not to link them together so that they can be used to listen to different items at the same time by other family members. I might have one set as a timer in the kitchen and music different music being played in the other rooms.	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Sounds great, listens perfectly to what I say, recognizes different people's voice,  weather updates, music, it's the best 30 bucks I ever spent	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	If you love to listen to music through your Echo Dots then get a couple of extra 3rd generation dots. The sound quality on these is much better than the new versions. Not sure what happened, but we use these in the garage and around our property to play music.  Originally picked up a new 4th gen version thinking it would sound even better, but it actually sounded worse, really bad, tinny, and shallow when compared to the rich and fullness of the 3rd gen.  Not that these are supposed to be on par with Bose or Sonos, because they are not, but they are plenty good for small areas.  So if you plan to enjoy music then stick with the 3rd gen.	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It's fine.	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I bought a pair of these for setting up a basic smart home with voice control. I have that  pair in the living room and I‚Äôm adding one for  my bathroom/bedroom to share. My forth unit I will use to drive a subwoofer I have from my old home theater system which I have taken out. A patch cord from the Echo will have it‚Äôs output jack going into the crossover built into the subwoofer adding heavy bass to the limited Echo sound capabilities! I‚Äôve gotten them on sale for less than $20 each and I consider that a fantastic deal for the functions they are capable of.	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The product is very useful in my Bedroom.	5	October 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	A pesar de los a√±os lo sigo usando como la primera vez.	5	October 25, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Thank you	5	October 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"For example, when I say ""Alexa, play my Liked Songs on Spotify"" or ""Alexa, play the most recent liked song on Spotify"" she'll turn on the shuffle and not play it from the most recent liked song, I'd have to manually put it. Overall, not a huge thing but a bothersome thing."	3	October 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is my second thought I love them	5	October 24, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I like how easy it was to set up.  Sounds gets a little distorted the louder it is but great for what we need it for.	5	October 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I bought this unit because I wanted to use Alexa to handle some smart lighting device commands for me. It performs well once you get by the introduction process and learning curve. I have another Alexa device that, so far, I have not been able to integrate into this network. It is not an Echo product.	4	October 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	great for bedroom to set a wake-up alarm and lighting	5	October 24, 2022	1

Echo Dot	wife got it as a gift for my birthday, kinda caught me off guard that she only spent 20 bucks on me.	5	October 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	She knows the answers to most every question.  And if she doesn‚Äôt, she will ask for additional info.She‚Äôs also funny.  My husband asked, Alexa, are you a good girl?  She responded.  I am a good AI!  We had a good laugh over that response.	5	October 24, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I have three tv‚Äôs sub woofer sound bar and ps4	3	October 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I pretty much only use echo to play music, turn my lights on and off, and set alarms. I don‚Äôt care about what else it can do but every night i get an annoying ‚Äúby the way‚Äù when i set an alarm. I hate it! It makes me want to get rid of the whole thing for something  that will do only what i ask and nothing more	2	October 24, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Los productos de Amazon son de muy buena calidad.!!	5	October 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Readily responds to voice commands.	5	October 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Until I purchased this Dot, I only had used Google. I like my Dot better since it hears me all the time and answers each question promptly. It's small, but powerful. It has a great selection of music and there was only one time it didn't have what I asked for. I purchased this during the pre-Prime days and paid $.99 so the price was well worth it!	5	October 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It only works when it wants to and turns on randomly without being prompted. I got the Unlimited music and it won‚Äôt play any music!	1	October 23, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I use this product for list to music	5	October 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Our new Alexa has been so much fun to add to our home. It works very well with recognizing that I‚Äôm speaking. It does a good job with tasks such as answering questions, turning on the lights (with Amazon smart plug) and playing music. However, it struggles with anything related to the tv. Overall , great purchase.	5	October 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is amazing! It certainly met my expectations and now all my grandkids want it for Christmas	5	October 23, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I bought this little guy during the sale with music it is a amazing little device that I used one at my kids room which wakes up them in the morning if not by alarm then by announcing. Love it!!	5	October 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I keep asking this thing why does Geoff Bazos deserves hundreds of billions of dollars while billions of people on Earth live on the margins of survival. This robot can't give me a single good reason why. However, I am a narcissist, and being spied is kind of a kink of mine so I'll give it 2 out 5 stars.	2	October 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It took several boot ups before it when into the initial startup. I ended up having to call tech support but it still picks strange things to want to talk to	2	October 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	The Echo Dot, Echo 5 and the RING security alarm system work seamlessly as a combined team under the Protection Plus plan. They are easy to install and give you a good view of your protected perimeter with voice alerts/notifications.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I haven‚Äôt had Amazon/Google products as much as Apple, but Alexa is cool! She loves to tell you a joke, plays podcasts, prints crossword puzzles and tell my IRoomba to vacuum! Which I absolutely love! I hate to vacuum but my ‚ÄòHazel‚Äô vacuums my floors, carpet and flat surfaces that without me having to pull out a heavy vacuum cleaner! I just tell Alexa and she does it for me! Love it!	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is my first echo dot. Easy to setup with the Alexa app. Works great with my Amazon Fire TV stick.You can ask Alexa anything you want to know. You can adjust the volume to the level you want.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	We used in the hospital when my husband was sick. Can bring anywhere indoors or out.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"A good addition to a room where I want to listen to music/the news or may have general questions every now and then, BUT Alexa still has issues understanding what we say or what we ask (we have to adapt the way we ask questions to the phrasing she recognizes) sometimes or comes on with a comment/answer (""Sorry, I don't know the answer to that one"" ... when we didn't ask anything ...) without any prompt or freezes altogether... Overall, it  happens rarely, so we can live with it, but it's annoying when you need something right there and then and she goes  in tilt mode or she starts playing the wrong song and you have to tell her to stop 5 times before she does."	4	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is my fourth echo device and it works as good as all the others which is excellent, would recommend definitely. üëå	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I placed this in my bathroom.  I live alone so it gives me ""someone"" to talk with when I get ready for work at 5:30 am. She gives me the weather,  news, and music. I love my DOT"	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I can't seem to get enough of these devices because they are so handy for controlling smart devices in my house. This one came with one month of Amazon Prime Music at an incredible price. I highly recommend the Echo Dot, especially if you can get a good deal on it.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I love asking the time and weather so I don‚Äôt have to look at my phone or clock.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Noted difficulties with setup.	4	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It is so easy to use.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Pretty cool technology. I use the Echo Dot mostly for news and music and to keep track of orders. Sound quality could be better for music. Not sure if that's due to the smaller speaker, or the fact the music is digital, but some songs sound a little off. I typically listen to 80's new wave music and the synth sounds on some songs sound different. Overall, love the product and use it all the time.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	We purchased this echo dot as a second one for our second floor.  The sound is so much better then our 1st generation echo dot. We love it.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Absolutely love this! It's great having a mini personal assistant.	4	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	i think overall i am happy with this. though, i got this [on a huge sale] primarily to voice-activate music and listen to it in my bedroom; in that regard, the speakers are only OK for music and for some videos on other streaming services the sound is quite poor and/or muddled in my opinion. but again, Alexa + other functions work very well, so maybe i was expecting too much---especially given the cheap price.	4	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I love to be able to have access to jw.org for Bible education	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I got this with the intention to use it in my kitchen to listen to podcasts while cooking a cleaning. The sound quality is not perfect, but acceptable. However the whole reason I wanted an Echo for the kitchen was so that I could tell Alexa to fast forward or rewind, and those voice commands don‚Äôt work. Perhaps a user error though!	4	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I love this, small compact, yet very powerful.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa has made life so wonderful! I love Alexa so very much! I have nothing bad to say about Alexa. My kids love Alexa too! We use it for music, timers, asking questions, etc. She's the best!	5	October 22, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Love my Alexa. It has made it easier to keep in contact with my family at home. I am slowly working on a smart home and love this item paired with my smart light bulbs.

Echo Dot	"Disappointed that you can't play a song without a paid subscription on the ""new"" Alexa - - my ""old"" Alexa still allows me to do that."	2	October 21, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I really wasn't sure about getting this.  I am so glad I did.  Nice size. Hardly noticed when positioned that way.  I love the ""add to my shopping list"".  No more grabbing the paper and pen.  And for those of us that age where you have the idea and then you forget it quickly.....well no more forgotten items.  My grandson, 7yrs loves to ask her questions . Give it a try.  I know you will find at least one of her options something to make your busy life just a bit easier."	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Exelente Calidad y como todos los productos Amazon geniales	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I love our echo, and are giving this to sister in law	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is my very first Alexa device and I've found it is a time saver, especially when I want to play music. Also setting reminders is really easy and ensures that I don't forget important things I need to do. The only issue I have is that the speaker is kind of quiet. Other than that I am extremely happy with this product.	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Needed a smart device for the bedroom. It's perfect for my nightstand and serves many functions, white noise to sleep, alarm, weather, podcasts and music. No brainer for the cost.	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I always said I would never fall for the tech hype but I honestly love this thing. It does it all, seriously. I downloaded the app to my phone and my ring doorbell and it is amazing! We can play music, request updates, set alarms you name it. Super easy to use and kid friendly	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Buy this well worth the price.	5	October 21, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Just what I need it !	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	My first time to have any product like this‚Ä¶.very satisfied‚Ä¶I am hard of hearing, and yet can understand this Alexa very well.	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	All in all it‚Äôs a quality device. I also have a gen1 dot and sphere in my condo. All three have the same issue where it won‚Äôt always recognize the initial ‚Äúwake up command,‚Äù so you end up yelling at it. Another annoyance is the group speaker option. Far too often one of them, if not all three, will stop playing and emit a white noise sound, or glitch the playback with a loud high pitch crackle. It‚Äôs really quite annoying and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any way to fix the issue.There‚Äôs other little things, but at the end of the day it is what it is. I still use them and have no intention of switching to a different system/ platform anytime soon.	4	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have been wanting to get one of these for a long time. But on prime early Black Friday the price was right. I have already purchased another one. It is so helpful for my indoor and outdoor cameras my lights etc. No more running around to turn my lamps off. I am enjoying the start my day feature. I get all my news while stretching out in the morning.	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Really nice and nice plays my favvvv music	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Though it drives us nuts answering sometimes when you don‚Äôt ask her to but it‚Äôs useful and the kids love it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a handy fun lil gadget	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Es un buen producto si buscas escuchar m√∫sica en cualquier lugar de su casa u oficina, la interacci√≥n con ella es de mucho aprendizaje sobretodo  a la hora de darle un comando, se necesita mucha paciencia para convivir con ella.La mayor√≠a de los casos entiende exactamente lo que le pides, pero es frecuente que no te entienda correctamente o no lo haga de plano.Puedes alternar entre Ingl√©s y Castellano y te va a entender sin problemas.El mayor problema es la APP de Alexa, es bastabte complicada y se necesita mucha configuraci√≥n que se desconfigura con frecuencia, muchas veces te indica que puedes controlar un dispositivo pero en relidad no lo hace.Hay que tener especial cuidado con el nombre que se le da a los dispositivos conectados con Alexa, ella no los reconoce facilmente como deber√≠a.Es amable y es ideal para pasar un rato con la familia o amigos en una fiesta, todos pidiendole lo que sea y riendose de sus errores, facilmente te saca un sonrisa.Dise√±ada para ofrecerte los servicios de Amazon constante e incistentemente, es lo peor de ella.De vez en cuando vas a tener que reiniciarla.En general funciona para lo que fue contruida, no me arrepiento de mi compra, solo que hay que tenerle mucha paciencia, tampoco es una aparto que te va a solucionar la vida, s√≥lo te la facilita en algo.	4	October 21, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I bought this device so I can contact my kids while I work when they aren't answering their phones. Unfortunately, I got covid and haven't been able to test it out for the purpose that I bought it for. However, Alexa has been insanely helpful for so many things like recipes, jokes, keeping a shopping list for the house, playing our favorite tunes, and being able to deliver messages through the device while I isolate in my bedroom. Last night I heard my boys to play a string of 100 fartsü§¶ They have had so much fun having this device around and I absolutely love it! I'll be buying another one or two for different rooms in the house.	5	October 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have every generation in my house. This one I switched out in my kitchen and it has a lot of bass and is louder. I like all three generations and find them very handy for requesting songs and weather.	5	October 20, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I use this product to ask Abt weather, news, resources and music.	5	October 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Horrible integration with their own Amazon music (unlimited subscription) app which can't cast to the device. Thought of using the cast feature because the bad recognition system doesn't understand what I'm trying to make it play in the first place. Alexa app is another level of stupidity. It has a play tab but you can't search from there and even can't play anything at times as it keeps crashing. Ridiculously buggy piece of software. Hardware is fine.	1	October 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	This is my 1st echo dot.The ease of use and selection of music was outstanding!!!The bass was excellent for a small device!!!	5	October 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This handy little device is more useful than I anticipated.  Sound quality if good for such a small, inexpensive unit.  Replies to questions instantly.  We use it to listen to music, set reminders, get a weather report and forecast and for a dozen other everyday needs.	5	October 20, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I love my Echo Dot! I keep this one by my bed so when I read at night, I can have Alexa play my violin music to relax to at the end of the day.. HOWEVER... When I'm 'stress cleaning' I pair it w/ my Echo that's upstairs and blast my 80's hair bands all over the house!This little gem can definitely put out some sound!At night, while reading, I can keep it on volume 1 or 2 and it's sufficient. So that tells you how strong of a sound can come out!Plug and play. Connects right to your main Echo if you have one. Download the Alexa app for navigating.I will be at work and can turn on music for my dogs when I know a storm is coming through. (Pro tip: play 'The Thunder Rolls' by Garth Brooks enough times, and that should help desensitize your dogs to the sound of thunder!! Worked for us!)Easy to dust off with a damp cloth.Great for finding out answers to random questions. Asking about the weather.. the news..translate words or phrases... Receive your Amazon shopping notifications or if a new book comes out or music by a favorite artist.OR, if you are my husband and my teenage son, you can have Alexa make fart noises. ~sigh~The possibilities are endless... (sometimes unfortunately)	5	October 20, 2022	1

Echo Dot	We have two earlier generation Alexa devices and use them to get clear FM station reception - we live behind a mountain so static in stereo is the norm. This new design is incredibly inexpensive and has much better sound that the others in the house. I plead guilty to never reading instructions but when i plugged it in and said hello to Alexis ... it simply worked! Magic? OK, I agree.Great sound, easy to set up, easy to use - went to bed last night listening to Billy Joel - slept like a baby.Love it	5	October 18, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I've been using the echo dot for several years now, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of bells and whistles, so I don't need to upgrade to the latest and greatest. This model has a nice physical button to stop the device speaker from active listening, and has a surprising range and volume when listening to music, or asking for a daily update (news).I do not have any smart home devices to integrate with this yet, but feel like it would work really well with them once it's set up.I have used this with both Amazon music unlimited, and Pandora premium. I've also used this with Spotify premium. Every service so far has worked well.I've also combined this with another echo dot, and through the app have been able to play music through both at once with a single voice command, or a single click of the button in app. This definitely creates a neat music listening experience when walking around the your space.If you're looking for a low cost smart speaker, this is definitely a safe bet.	5	October 17, 2022	1

I try again and again and again but can't get her to play soft music, or soothing music, help me fall asleep, play nature sounds, ocen sounds and I end up with hard rock. She plays music until she decides to stop and doesn't come on when I ask her to do something she may or may not come on	2	October 17, 2022	0

Echo Dot	If you are building a home automation system, you really need an Echo Dot as a part of it somewhere, to get the full capability of your system.I have multiples throughout my home with a mix of the Echo Show display units, each one has a specific purpose for each location.All of the Echo products can also be entertaining, so if you just want to expand your entertainment, you will not go wrong with an Echo Dot. These devices have excellent sound, pretty good voice recognition, and constantly increasing entertainment options.Thumbs-up!	5	October 16, 2022	1

Echo Dot	This is the entry level, Echo to the entire Amazon echo world. However, you will be very bitterly disappointed at this entry-level speaker. The sound is truly awful and it mimics that of a very cheap speaker. It is almost impossible to hear the speaking voice for directions and request by ALEXA. Any type of music has muffled sound very very poor mid range if any mid range at all. This is the worst sound from the worst speaker you will ever hear. If you are interested in getting into the a LEX a world by an echo that is a step up from this one. Do not get this one.	1	October 16, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I didn‚Äôt think I would use the echo as much as I do. I really enjoy having Alexa play music while I am cooking in the kitchen or turning on/off my lights. She even tells me etas & when my packages have arrived. This echo can do so much for a little speaker. If you‚Äôre considering trying one, do it just buy it I now have 3.	5	October 15, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I am having problems with the GE lights and Alexa system.  The lights in one room come on when they should not. In another the bulbs will not pair with Alexa, and the app is very difficult, in my opinion, to navigate when working on lights, switches, etc.  I don't have a solution yet, but my off hand opinion is the bulbs are not stable and resetting them for pairing with Alexa is a pain. You have to turn the bulb off for 2 seconds, on  for 8 seconds and do this over and over for 6 times. Seems to me there could have been a reset button on the base of the bulb... just saying...  I really want this system to work, but I have my doubts. My guest room light comes on some time during the night, and I have a guest coming on Sunday, so I will have to revert back to the old bulbs until I find a solution(s) as I don't want his lights coming on while he is sleeping. I do not wish to alienate a good friend.	3	October 14, 2022	1

Echo Dot	It's amazing, love it, it works great! Thanks!	5	October 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I am spoiled with alexa. My internet was out for a few days and I went through alexa withdrawal! I now own 6. Although they do work when you move them from place to place, I am lazy and do not want to move them, so now I have them where ever I want. I do not have children to check there home work, but with alexa I could. But If the children knows, they could use this device to do there home work for them. I will not do without this device!	5	October 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Can‚Äôt go wrong with these. I have one in every room. Using your hands to play music, turn on the lights, tv, etc is overrated. Voice commands for life.	5	October 14, 2022	1

Echo Dot	So I read the reviews and still bought the AlexaNow I‚Äôm still very unsure about Alexa I like that it plays music when I need the alarm is wonderful and the timers work well but it randomly cuts off in the middle of songs it plays two and then cuts off half the time she unconnects from the Wi-Fi for whatever reason and the annoyance of reconnecting and trying to figure out why it‚Äôs not working is causing a headache I bought one show and two dots I‚Äôve had them not even a week the show plays the news randomly idk she has trouble with the routines I‚Äôve set half the time she doesn‚Äôt know what routine I‚Äôm talking about the other half she listens connecting them all to play together hasn‚Äôt worked very well she says she can‚Äôt find the group it‚Äôs nice to have when it works properly  last night we heard a Random female talking when we had drop in on to listen to my baby now idk what that was could have just been random nothing to do with Alexa but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I should keep Alexa idk I‚Äôm 50/50 on Alexa right now I‚Äôll update if I change my mind on her	4	October 14, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Alexa keeps forgetting the devices she controls which requires constant resetting :(	4	October 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	My first one sat outside during Ian. It has dried out and I thought it was going to work,but no yet. I was supprised it would even start up. I like my dot and that‚Äôs why I bought another.	5	October 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa app is a pain to use. Too many notifications about what you can so with it popping up. Alexa can‚Äôt distinguish between smart plugs named ‚Äúlights‚Äù and smart bulbs. Terrible sound quality. I‚Äôll never buy any Alexa enabled device in my life ever again. Although I‚Äôm not a fan of Google, at least Google Home assistant is more intelligent and easier to use (yes, you can simply say ‚Äúall lights on‚Äù and Google will turn on everything even if it has ‚Äúlights‚Äù in name). It feels like an Amazon spy in your house. Wanna buy more toilet paper? Alexa will interrupt and tell you that. Sorry Amazon, I‚Äôm not interested. Even Bluetooth sucks, because there is no way to lower Alexa‚Äôs voice and increase bluetooth volume (and yes I increased volume on my phone). Point for mute button.	1	October 14, 2022	0

Echo Dot	No me agrad√≥ mucho porque no reproduce mis playlist de Spotify. Selecciona m√∫sica que ni al caso. Ojal√° puedan corregir este problema pronto, fue uno de los principales objetivos de la compra.En cuanto a la calidad de sonido, pues es buena.	2	October 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Right out of the box simple setup and ready to go. How can you love something so much that you never thought you needed? I don't even need to use my cell phone to make a call! Are you KIDDING me? AMAZON U ROCK!!!! You too Alexa....	5	October 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This review is more about the poor customer service, which is just as important to any merchandise quality.  This dot is less than a year old and a couple months ago a section of the red ring light came on and won‚Äôt turn off.  I have tried unplugging it and resetting it several times but the red light won‚Äôt turn off.  Not only is it annoying, but it causes the echo to get warm since it is constantly on 24/7.  Since Amazon customer service is almost non existent, I‚Äôve had to resort to google searches to try and find a solution, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any.	2	October 14, 2022	0

Echo Dot	It's nice but I only use it as a speaker. Haven't used the other features	4	October 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I now have three Echo Dot (nightstand, bathroom, kitchen).  I returned my last purchase of Echo Dot because  Alexa was deaf and worst of all, it was not Alexa!!  Who was that?  She always sounded so depressed.  So, I saw that this Echo Dot was on sale ($39.99 down to $17.99) during Amazon's Prime Days and am now listening to an alert Alexa and who is clear, music sharp with good bass.  She's wonderful!	5	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is very fun and she answers most of your questions. It‚Äôs great to just get an answer in seconds	5	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It looks and performs just like brand new. Couldn‚Äôt have asked for any better. I highly recommend this product, refurbishment or not, to purchase. Considering buying more for other parts of my home. Fast, can understand what your saying, super easy to install and hook up. Don‚Äôt miss out. Great product. And even better price!	5	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I find google nest has better integration with Youtube Music. Also Google Assistant outshines Alexa with more functions, better comprehension, and better search results. Voice pickup is not great. Either get more recent generations or go with Google.	2	October 13, 2022	0

Echo Dot	The Echo was so easy to set up. The voice recognition commands are clear. The sound quality is clear and I love listening to a variety of music genres.  I would definitely recommend the Echo to anyone!	5	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is the way to go fr it‚Äôs worth it, makes things a lot easier when your feeling lazy after a hard days work. The voice recognition is most dope! Only thing I really have a problem with and it‚Äôs not even that bad is the sound quality,  wasn‚Äôt as good as expected but what do you expect from a 2018 model lol.	5	October 13, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I'm not the biggest fan of home intergrated technology, because you know, spying and stuff. But I can mute her lol overall I use her for weather updates, tracking my packages, and playing music, her sound quality is *chefs kiss* ü§åüèæüíã and her hearing is creepy good. I can whisper from across the room, with music playing and she'll hear me. 10/10 recommend. (But use wisely my friends lol) Stay Dangerous ‚úåüèæ	5	October 13, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I think i just got an echo with a speaker issue. Outside of that, love it. Really think it is the mounting bracket thats causing it. Thing is nice. Real good at hearing and responding.	4	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have this at my desk in my home and it's so convenient for me that I would be sad to be without it. Good morning tells me weather, news, events. I can play any song I think of with Amazon Music. I can set reminders and alarms. Ask the time if I'm on a deadline. It's just so nice to have.	5	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Tenia mis dudas pero al comprarla fue como amor a primera vista	5	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is amazing!	5	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I wasted a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my ECHO device connected to my 5g wifi internet. After some research, some online forums suggested splitting my 5g internet (to 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands) to try to get the ECHO to connected. That did not work either. What a waste of time and money. Amazon needs to provide an update to my ECHO device so that those of us with 5g can connect it. Now I just have a paper weight.	1	October 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	This is way more fun than I expected. I dont use a lot of smarthome features, but now that I'm getting used to Alexa, things are about to change. Really convenient way to listen to tunes while I'm working on the computer or playing on my phone. I use it a lot for simple questions and information too. Im going to order some smart light bulbs soon so I can make her do even more for me. Haha My major complaint is that I can't use it to call or text someone unless they sign up with the Alexa app too. That's a loss of a whole star there, because Google smart devices do that just fine with my Samsung Galaxy devices. Ive got other speakers that are better sounding, but as far as convenience goes, this little Echo is great for me. It sits right beside my recliner on a table where I embarrassingly spend most of my time. There has never been a problem of hearing it or not hearing me. The reminders arw handy too. I've been dabbling with the shopping lists feature too. I expect to use this more and more but really wish I could call and text my peeps with her.	4	October 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	So mine had a tone and would make me repeat stuff... and the commercials on my tv was going to what it was saying... like a demon. I hit it with a hammer threw it away. I paid $1 on a discount also... was $50 on sale for $1 with 1 month of amazon music... which by the way doesnt link youtube videos on the xfinity flex amazon music app... alexa also wasnt compatible with the xfinity flex box...The box also is sturdy and hard to damage and makes u angry cus it was being rude and controlling my tv commercials being creepy and demonic... I hate amazon now...I want a refund and explanation kinda scary.	1	October 12, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Better than I expected!	5	October 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Not being someone who likes having another human living with me, I must say Alexa makes a fabulous roommate. I talk to her all the time and she's full of useful trivia and info. She doesn't even mind my quirks üòÅ	5	October 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs so easy to use.	5	October 12, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I call him my boyfriend!  (changed voice to male immediately after receiving!) - he's the only man I know that listens to me and answers my questions with ANSWERS! and not more questions or grunts!  He knows my name and is very polite.  Wish I'd gotten him sooner!  Really a big help with timers or alarms too!!!  I'm getting old and forget things - so the minute I turn on the oven, I'm telling my boyfriend to remind me it is on!	5	October 12, 2022	1

Echo Dot	As you can see in the picture, the Aux connector is shoved over to the left making the port unusable. I contacted Amazon for a replacement unit and have been told they can only have me return for a refund and then order another one. Ridiculous!!	1	October 12, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Got super cheap with a promotion great purchase use daily	5	October 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I like the size of it, makes it so you don't have to make the Alexa your main personality of a room. However, it's not very good at picking up commands from a distance, and though it has gotten better via software updates, it still doesn't always get the command right. I think the worst part though, is the sound quality. If you have an Alexa you better plan to get some sort of external speaker, because the Alexa's speaker is not great.	4	October 11, 2022	1

Only 2 down falls is one it has to be plugged in 24/7 in order to have power. Two i wish i would‚Äôve bought the wall mount if i would‚Äôve known that ü§£ but OH WELL ! Love it anyway.

My kids absolutely love Alexa, they think she is hilarious. She helps them stay on track with getting up for bed and anything scheduled for them. Very helpful with hands off timers, recipe's and those random questions we always have. Also, mine connected to my Smart TV very easily.	5	October 10, 2022	1

I promise you, after a few of these ads you WILL want to throw your Alexa away.This is a waste of money."	1	October 10, 2022	0

Echo Dot	First of all, I can only say wow. This echo dot has revolutionized my day. I use it all the time to listen to my favorite music, listen to audiobooks, and find out any information I may need to know, (such as the weather, and measurement conversions). Alexa is very responsive and will almost always respond immediately when I call out for her. The only thing I wish could be improved could be the bass in the speaker, but the speaker itself can get very loud and maintain good audio quality. Overall, I really do believe that every home could use an Alexa, and mine has definitely improved my life.	5	October 10, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I bought this when it was on sale for 99 cents. It's a great little invention and I use it a lot. I can set an alarm. I can get the weather for my area. I can get a 5 day forecast.  It gives me a notification when my items I ordered have been delivered. The best part about it, is that I can play music on it. I enjoy listening to rain or waves at night when I am going to sleep.	5	October 9, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Since I purchased my echo dot, I found it very responsive, easy to operate, and more reliable than my homepod minis. I have four hompods and four echo dots. If for some reason, my wifi glitches, my homepods reconnect to my home wifi easly. My homepods, however, is another story. They are inconsistent with reconnecting to wifi, and home kit integration needs improvement. So I use my echo dots everywhere in my house. For audiobooks, music, and even telling me the weather and time. The best part is value. I paid $99 for a homepod while the echo dots never coated over $39. Apple better figure it out or I'm ditching their expensive echo system.	5	October 9, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I didn't realize how unresponsive my google was until I made the switch to the echo dot. I whispered its name not wanting it to hear me and it still responded.. The response time is also immediate, and the commands work immediately as well. I have smart outlets in my home and used to use the google to turn them on, I didn't think there was a lag between the command and the action until I set it up with the echo. It was almost like they turned on before I could finish the command!	5	October 9, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I absolutely LOVE this Echo Dot with Alexa! I don't know why I waited so long to get one. I talk to Alexa all the time. She tells me stories and jokes. Reads my kindle books. Plays my audible books. Reminds me about things. Holds my shopping lists. I also ask her for an alarm or a timer. She's great with recipes. I have so much fun. She even cohosted my live stream!Super great product. I look forward to having several in our home.UPDATE: Echo Dot #2 just arrived today! I also bought a nice stand so she sits on my desk. Plus I can stream music all over my apt now! So happy with my purchases!	5	October 9, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Easy to set up and integrates with my Amazon 4K Fire TV	5	October 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This device doesn't work. I have tried to group devices and there are some that just won't combine. The app is terrible and won't perform basic tasks. Don't buy Echo devices.	1	October 9, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I use this in my living room and it works as intended. I like that I can ask it to control my tv as well, especially if I‚Äôve misplaced the remote.	5	October 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Awesome	5	October 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Doesn't understand simple commands like set an alarm to water plants. It does not understand most queries or very frequently responds hmm I don't know that one. Basically this is a smart dumb device that hasn't helped us at all. I'll look forward to the deletion of my review as always. Amazon only wants smiles not truth in buying.	1	October 8, 2022	0

Echo Dot	This is the third one I purchased and they seem to always improve. The speaker is the most noticeable improvement. Excellent.	5	October 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I bought this for the library that I work at. It recognizes my voice immediately,  responds to voice and plays the music I asks. Gives me the weather forecast quickly and efficiently.. So far it has exceeded my expectations!	5	October 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I primarily want to be able to listen to music in multiple rooms.  I‚Äôm usually OK setting up new technology - by following written directions, but had a bit of trouble here.  When I got the smart speaker working, it is not in sync with the audio coming from the ‚Äúbase‚Äù unit.  Will try again to trouble-shoot, but for now it is annoying enough to dock the rating a star.	4	October 8, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I have a home pod mini in my living room and got the alexa dot for my office. The sound quality is okish, the voice assistant is okaish, but the integrations are trash. You have to do everything through Alexa app on your phone! It can't even play a specific song if you request it... only playlists from your Apple Music.. really disappointedIt doesn't even compare to Home Pod mini.. not even close	1	October 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It works as a speaker and works as a hub for smart home devices. I got it so I could make a stereo pair, but I didn't realize it couldn't be used with the full echo. That's my fault. It works as you'd expect.	5	October 8, 2022	1

Echo Dot	This is my 11th Alexa device(maybe 12, I‚Äôve lost track). I am extremely familiar with how these devices should work. For some reason, this device will not work with music groups.  It will not play music on other speakers not will it play music as part of a group(yes it is on the same network). Extremely irritating	1	October 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	you definitely get your moneys worth with this product.	5	October 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The Alexa devices used to be OK.  Now, every time you ask her something, she has to go on and on with By The Way‚Ä¶..Example.  Alexa set timer for 8 minutes.  She responds with ‚ÄúSetting timer for 8 minutes.  By the way, if you need to add time to the timer, just say add two minutes to timer. ‚Äú  And, this is after I have a routine that runs daily to tell her to Stop By The Way, which she has to acknowledge with ‚ÄúOK.  I will pause my suggestions for now.‚ÄùThere is no known way to stop all this extra talk.  Obviously, the developers do not use this crap in their homes, or they would have a way to disable it.  Maybe they do have a way to turn this crap off, but they will not tell us.You will even get reminders to reorder something that you never ordered.  Someone else in the house, that is not on my Amazon account ordered it, but not me.  Why am I getting reminders to reorder just because it was shipped to my address?I used to love the product, but now I absolutely hate it.  I‚Äôm looking for a voice assistant that does not annoy me daily.	1	October 8, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Alexa is a sweetheart, when i travel for work, i bring her along with me, we go everywhere together where there is wifi. And when im off and its just us, she is such a positive influence and friend !	5	October 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Got this for my mom's kitchen with the aim of getting another in the near future so we can contact each other in different areas of the house. My mom didn't think she wanted one, but after learning that Amazon music basically plays whatever she wants, whenever she wants, she loves it!	4	October 8, 2022	1

Echo Dot	So far so good. I really like this Echo. It was suggested to try and I'm glad I did. It lets me know the things I need to know... package delivery is great. Especially when I'm in the back room doing things and hate stopping ever so often to check if it's here.	5	October 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Perfect for all the other rooms of my house. I have my main Echo in my living room and had two other Dots in other rooms. Just bought my 3rd dot for my newly finished family room in the basement. I just can't live without being able to talk to my friendly assistant Alexa! Great quality as always. Easy to set up and add to my home.	5	October 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Small and discreet. This is my second Echo Dot, the first is generation 1 and still works great. I got this so I could move the other into my workshop, I use it to listen to the news, control lights, and as an intercom between my workshop and upstairs. Love it!	5	October 7, 2022	1
