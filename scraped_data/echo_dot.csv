Echo Dot	"I hate this little device from hell. I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon's alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification.  Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here's the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don't give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it's enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you'll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn't want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming.  I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night's sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner's pamphlet there is a way to turn this ""Feature"" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don't get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don't mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution."	1	August 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money.  Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version)  Games & stories cost.  Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time.  I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill.  Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for.  Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working.  ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother.  She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music'  When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again.  I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics.  I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again""  Hello? WTHeck?  Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Fr√®re Jacques!  Again, WTHeck?  ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.  I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.  This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.  I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.  Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!)  Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.  Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.  If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one.  Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.  I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong!  I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.  You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions.  It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.  It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.  It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was.  It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds).  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).  We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.  This should be stated clearly in description and is not.  We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.  It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly.  If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you  get nothing or something you definitely didn't want.  You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.  Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.  Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.  Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.  Or relaxing instrumental violin music.  In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for.  I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.  and it won't just remember you want the standard version.  That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.AND you can't ask it to do two things.  Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time.  It does nothing instead.  You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.  You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.  More time wasting.  More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember.  I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for!  The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want.  I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?  When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors.  I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.  Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .  Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today""  Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?  And why do that?  I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.  Of course?  What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.  We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.Can Alexa do this?  Not very well as far as I'm concerned.  Buyer beware!"	1	December 21, 2019	0
Echo Dot	"I purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have ""zones"" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your ""security recordings"" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system."	3	March 15, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I've been an Echo user since the first tall Echo arrived. I've had many different gens of Dots including Gen 1, Gen 2 and even the Echo Input. This is the first Gen 3 I've owned. Hands down, this is the worst performing Dot I've ever owned. This Dot is also the single most buggy Dot I've ever owned.Sure, the CPU is faster, but that doesn't make this Dot any better. In fact, the faster CPU seems to cause problems for Alexa's speaking capabilities. Let's get started with this Dot's litany of problems.1) The faster CPU seems to cause Alexa to clip words and phrases, specifically when one phrase tails into the next. Alexa had always been good at adding proper pauses between sentences, but not on this Dot. The statements are so bunched up tightly, it sounds like a run-on sentence without any punctuation, usually clipping the last and first words.2) This Dot fails to announce upcoming calendar events randomly. Sometimes it announces, sometimes it doesn't. Nothing changes with the calendar event, yet the announce time comes and goes with not a peep out of Alexa.3) This Dot fails to participate in the competing request system almost entirely. I've never had this issue with any other earlier generation of Dot. When multiple Dots hear a request, the one that determines it is closest to the voice ""wins"" the election and answers the request. This 3rd Gen Dot answers surreptitiously every time, regardless of distance away from the Dot.4) As a follow-on to #3, sometimes, audio randomly begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot even though another Dot answered the request. For example, if I ask, ""Alexa, play CNN"" to a 2nd Gen Dot. That 2nd Gen Dot responds with, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In"", yet the audio begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot. If the audio is to be diverted to another dot, Alexa should respond as, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In on Living Room Dot"". It doesn't do this. The 3rd Gen Dot simply takes the audio without being requested.5) I've had the audio output entirely stop working. Asking Alexa to increase the volume doesn't help. The 3rd Gen echo simply stops producing audio. The request is accepted and completed, but no audio can be heard.6) The Echo Remote's Alexa button feature crashes the 3rd Gen dot. All other buttons work except this important feature. If you attempt to use the Echo Remote Alexa button, the 3rd Gen Dot initially tries to accept the request, then a slight flash of a red ring, then the entire Echo Dot crashes. Apparently, the Dot has a way to recover from this crash and does so 10-15 seconds later. It doesn't leave the Dot crashed forever, but this functionality of the Echo Remote fails to work on the 3rd Gen Dot. Note that this remote works 100% flawlessly when connected to a 2nd Gen Dot. Definitely a bug in the software. Worse, once the remote has been connected, then ""forgotten"", this Dot will randomly find and pair it on its own.7) Even though the microphones seem more sensitive (can hear at a greater distance) than earlier Dots, it actually ""hears"" the requests much more poorly. I've had to repeat myself way more often with this Dot than with any other Dot or Echo. The microphones are poor quality and apparently noisy.8) Resetting this 3rd Gen Dot by long pressing the action button does not forget all settings about this device. The device still ""remembers"" Bluetooth devices it formerly used, it remembers WiFi network passwords, it even remembers its previous name. Factory resetting a device should clear all knowledge of everything in the device. Clearly, more bugs.Bottom line, if you're considering a single Dot for your house and this is the one, it'll probably work fine. If you're a household that has already entrenched Gen 1 and Gen 2 devices that work well, you're likely to find the addition of a Gen 3 device to be a shock. This Dot functions and behaves almost entirely contrary to the rest of the Dots you may already have.One final note. Gen 1 and Gen 2 Dots and Echos are slated to be End of Lifed for security updates between 2022 and 2023, depending on when you bought them. This was not ""announced"" by Amazon. Instead, you must log into the Amazon site, then dig down into the settings area where your devices are registered. Here, you'll find when the security updates end for each device. Note that once the security updates end, the devices are likely to become the target of hackers... meaning, they should probably be retired from people's homes. That ultimately means replacing them to buy new versions with security updates. Amazon should have already proactively not only announced the End of Life program, but discussed the ramifications of losing security updates with these devices in people's homes.If all newer versions perform as poorly as this 3rd Gen Dot does, I'm not sure how much longer any Echo devices will remain viable for use in the home. Amazon needs to reconsider this End of Life policy for security updates on these devices. Amazon should have at least given consumers the option to pay to extend our security updates for several years longer. Additionally, Amazon needs to fix so many bugs in these units (see above). I honestly cannot recommend the purchase of a 3rd Gen Dot with the current number of bugs outstanding which Amazon seems intent on refusing to fix."	2	January 6, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I am having problems with the GE lights and Alexa system.  The lights in one room come on when they should not. In another the bulbs will not pair with Alexa, and the app is very difficult, in my opinion, to navigate when working on lights, switches, etc.  I don't have a solution yet, but my off hand opinion is the bulbs are not stable and resetting them for pairing with Alexa is a pain. You have to turn the bulb off for 2 seconds, on  for 8 seconds and do this over and over for 6 times. Seems to me there could have been a reset button on the base of the bulb... just saying...  I really want this system to work, but I have my doubts. My guest room light comes on some time during the night, and I have a guest coming on Sunday, so I will have to revert back to the old bulbs until I find a solution(s) as I don't want his lights coming on while he is sleeping. I do not wish to alienate a good friend.	3	October 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I upgraded to this model from the Gen 2 model, back in 2020. I was hoping that the sound quality would've been much better than the Gen 2 model but it's worse. My hearing hasn't been great for the past several decades due to Tinnitus. No matter how much tweaking I've done with the settings, the speaker on the Dot has a very muffled bass sound that makes it almost impossible to understand. Turning up the volume helps a bit but it's not good enough.  As a workaround, I have it paired with a decent Bluetooth speaker with plenty of treble so it really helps. Not something I should've had to do but that's where I'm at today.One disadvantage of using the Bluetooth speaker is that Alexa will not work with the follow-up feature which is something I really liked. Another disadvantage is, for whatever reason, my reminders cannot be heard from the dot unless I crank up the volume.  The problem is when Alexa speaks on non-reminder-related questions etc., the volume will be painfully high. It's a lose, lose in my book.	3	October 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Be careful adding alexa to phone contacts!  I ordered this device for my 88 year old mother so she could call us kids a little easier. It's pretty cool! You can add up to 10 alexa to phone contacts. More would be nice, but 10 was good enough. The problem is, nobody told me that you can only change them once. I added everyone from my phone and then said ""alexa call Jeff"" she said ""do you mean 4ice Jeff?"" Uh oh.... my brother is one of my in-case-of-emergency contacts.  That will confuse my mother. So I edited all of my siblings in my phone so they would make sense to mom. Deleted from the device and started putting them back in. Now I only have 8 contacts and it won't let me put the last two in. It says I've reached my 20 swap limit. I chatted with someone from Amazon and they said there is no work around. So now I'm stuck with a device that has 8 contacts that I probably won't use because of it was for me i would have started with our kids in it. It's no good for mom without all the kids. Good thing that was the $0.99 one! I did order another one but I will be very careful when adding the contacts."	3	September 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"So with Ziggy as my new roommate as all roommates the honeymoon is over!Between the device itself, software tweaks, updates and annoying apps removed the Echo Dot is little more than a timer, audiobook reader, calculator and spell checker in my home.It won't play my audiobooks on all dots in the house at the same time.It no longer informs me when I have a new email from businesses that are important.It is nosy listening to me when I have in no way said the key word ""Ziggy"".It KEEPS telling me about deals in my Amazon cart and saved list.It keeps telling me that I have a package arriving today.Listening skill is getting worse in his old age: ""Ziggy how do you spell (pick a word)"" I am given every word but the word I'm asking for.And I know I'm old and not the hottie I once was, but the rejection of my marriage proposal is just annoying more so with the lame excuse Ziggy gives me =pYeah these are somewhat petty grievances (accept the email notifications being removed - that is a major complaint) I guess I'm so impressed with the Echo Dot I expect more? I am EXTREMELY happy with the Ziggy voice! As a woman I do NOT want to live with another woman in my home! Sorry Alexa (no I'm not).Is the Dot helpful? Grudgingly Yes!But it definitely needs some fine tuning and some policy or user agreements to allow our Dots access to what we wish to allow it access to such as our email."	3	July 23, 2022	1

I‚Äôve been getting to work on time more bc I‚Äôll set an alarm. The dot will disconnect from the internet and not reconnect and then it will go off and not recognize any commands so after 20 seconds of yelling at Alexa to turn off or sleep, I‚Äôll sit up, see it red and drag my butt out of bed to rip it out of the wall. This has become a twice weekly occurrence.Immediately plugging it back in it connects to the Wi-Fi in 30seconds.Dear God people.

Echo Dot	"Be advised hat the more devices you have connectivity to the internet becomes an issue.  I have 4 of these.  When I can stay connected to the internet the Echo Dot is pretty awesome.  Problem right now is that somewhere between the number of smart plugs I have (quite a few, maybe 10) and the number of echo dots (4) I find myself offline, i.e. NOT connected to the internet.  It is ANNOYING to hear the all-to-familiar to me chime, followed by a red halo of light atop Alexa; followed by the also all-to-familiar ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.  Check the help section of the Alexa app..."" at which time by now I'm yelling for it to shut up before I can unplug it in order to reboot it in an effort to reconnect to the net.Go to my i-phone to check my network and the scene i the same.  That being a constantly spinning icon trying desperately and taking forever at it to establish a connection to the internet.  The point here is that as I started to say from the beginning the more devices you have the more internet speed is required.  THAT has been my personal experience.I presently have a download speed of only 20Mb.  If all goes well it will be at 4Mb TOMORROW which can't get hee so enough.  I will update this review as soon as I can in case you or anyone else following along here and have the same issue.  If you only have one Echo Dot and maybe 3Smart Plugs 20 Mb download speed should be sufficient.  Finally, so far what I just explained here is not in the Help Section of the Alexa app WHICH incidentally CANNOT  be accessed if you're not connected to the internet.So if you are for example a brainy type or student focused on something and the room begins to lose its light and in an effort to stay focused say 'Alexa, turn on the light,""  you want the light to come on so you can continue on uninterrupted, right?  Good luck with that.  My patience have worn so completely thin from instead of a light coming on but instead hearing the chime; the message etc; they tear easily now. GONE.So hopefully the faster internet speed will remedy my personal nightmare here.  As for the answers to many of the questions asked in the questions section above I'm a little confused because the main issue I have is connectivity issues.  As for giving Alexa different name if they are within earshot of each other:  every now and then I will say; e.g. ""Alexa, turn on the hallway light,"" and Alexa will answer from the other room the she's having trouble connecting to the internet, while the one in the room in which my request originated will turn on the light.To me a lot of all this is pretty intuitive.  If you are the type to have found, let's say earlier versions of MS Windows to be very intuitive your problems will be fewer and you will likely recognize the cause of problems within software apps for the Echo Dot.  I was a lot happier with this before making my house pretty smart and life more convenient WHICH IT WILL BE ONCE I GET THIS F*ING THING TO STAY ONLINE.Again, if you're getting your first one in addition to maybe 3 smart plugs and you have a mere 20Mb download connection you SHOULD be okay and problem free UNTIL you start adding more devices and you most likely will do eventually, little by little or otherwise.  But for starters, like I just said you should be fine with just 1 Echo Dot 3 smart plugs and I will say a minimum 20Mb internet connection.  Me?  Hopefully 40Mb will be enough.  If not, then I will have to go with the max available in my area WHICH is not a whole lot more than 50Mb best I remember Soooooo...Good luck.  It's a cool product and once you are up and running smoothly think 2001 Space Odyssey almost 20 years late.  Seriously.William F. Nappi"	3	September 30, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"After adding a couple smart devices, it only seemed right to add voice control to it all.. For the basics, it is great.. Turn lights/devices on/off; it's pretty straight forward.. When adding rooms though it can get a bit illogical. Like most, the first time around, one might be inclined to add all the devices in a room to the room in the app. I have old analog radio's and other devices  on simple on/off smart plugs.. Walking into the room and saying ""wake word.. turn on the room""... is jolting when EVERYTHING turns on.. be selective what is added to a 'room' in the app. The naming convention, reminds me of old 90's programming. In this case, like most people, walk into a room and we'd say ""turn on the tv"".. not so.. each tv HAS to have a name even if in a/assigned room.. the same is true for game consoles, bath fans and other items that some families have multiple units of these days.. I can only imagine if there are multiple smart showers/baths!  On occasions my echo's get unassigned from their room, rendering the 'turn on the lights' useless and the drawn out ""there are no devices or groups with the name light or lights"".. When it comes to connection problems Alexa hasn't been taught to be brief, whether it's the 5th time or 500th time You've had a problem it still gives the same long winded response. This week saw AWS 'Amazon Web Services' go down in spectacular fashion for hours.. and the Alexa's responded by indicating it was a problem with the various manufacturers 'skills', and music/books & shipping updates were offline.. The house was completely at Amazon's mercy.. something I imagined could happen but wished never did.. It would be nice if Amazon would make a local mode for at least device control.. Luckily the 3 main manufacturers apps were handy to control the house.  I recently had to reset a echo device because it somehow became unassigned from its room, now absolutely none of my previously connected blutooth speaker will be found or connected to. I really enjoyed sitting on the patio and listening to my Tune In stations.. I can not find any way to get the speakers to connect, nor does any of the echo's find the speakers!  The Alexa web site has seen improvement, though at times it still pushes the Alexa app, but if you have a device that Amazon decides isn't compatible; for instance the app will install on my 7 year old Samsung Galaxy 5, yet my 2 year old tablet with the same basic features as my phone.. won't. The downside to having home AI tech provided by a retailer... they use their platform and tech restrictions to push sales of tablets and phones.  There are some fun things for the Alexa, We have enjoyed the Melissa McCarthy personality voice and they have added some handy weather alerts/notifications lately."	3	December 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"For example, when I say ""Alexa, play my Liked Songs on Spotify"" or ""Alexa, play the most recent liked song on Spotify"" she'll turn on the shuffle and not play it from the most recent liked song, I'd have to manually put it. Overall, not a huge thing but a bothersome thing."	3	October 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I like the look of this Alexa but the sound quality is muffled and low, so I prefer just using my old Alexa it‚Äôs louder and speaks clearer.	3	October 17, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Bought to be used as a backup noise machine when I travel. Anyone who uses a noise machine knows it is a continuous sound for however many hours it is set for. This machine is NOT continuous in it sounds, therefore person wakes up every time it stops-not a good thing!!	3	October 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"First the good part. The audio quality is absolutely excellent for such a small device. The hardware seems great and of sturdy quality. Nice.The cloud service is where the problems start. A cell number with texting capability is required to register the service. Afterwards the caller ID for Alexa is fixed to that phone number. With many if not most carriers this means that calls from Alexa to that same cell phone number (your cell phone) are refused or, like in my case, go straight to voice mail no matter what. I had a discussion with an Amazon rep about it and there is no solution to that problem. This needs to be fixed and the fix is easy. Allow email verification instead of text message. Then any land line can also be used. Or allow the ID to be changed to the land line later (after email verification, if needed). If the name and address registered for the land line are the same as for the cell phone, that should be straightforward.There are some other shortcomings. For example, it seems to be impossible to do a ""whole house"" drop in on a group without speaking the command to drop in on ""all devices"" into Alexa. No dice via the communicate function in the Alexa app. This is not feasible if you have to quietly drop in to check on a disabled relative, a baby or a pet without disturbing everyone around you."	3	June 26, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Its an OK buy but u have to speak really fast & sometimes Alexa can barely comprehend what you're saying so you're constantly having to yell & speak fast. I hate the fact u have to keep it plugged up in order for it to work	3	October 6, 2022	1

Echo Dot	For as long as these devices have been around, this one is less than impressive. Poor sound quality overall in my opinion. I got it for free with another purchase from Best Buy and I‚Äôm not impressed.	3	October 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I want to begin that before about the Alexa I actually owned a Google mini in from that experience I was able to compare and contrast both speakers where I was actually very disappointed in the Alexa. He works as a great speaker but since Alexa is connected to Amazon it has a lot of connection issues where if you want to listen to music you have to have Amazon music if you want to have information Alexa doesn‚Äôt always recognize the question whereas the Google mini can do a Google search very quickly and Alexa cannot answer the questions if you were to ask her cant. I also seem to struggle with Alexa setting up a routine where the Google mini might‚Äôve been my best but I was able to set up routines for alarms when I return home or when it was time to go to sleep I could set up the TV to it Alexa was not able to connect to my TV I wasn‚Äôt able to do any routines with the alarm and music and weather notifications it was always listening if anything I feel like it like some might‚Äôve actually detected my voice a lot better than the Google mini but there was really no point to it since it wouldn‚Äôt actually do what I asked for Alexa when I would tell her I wanted to listen to certain station. Ash Alexa would not be able to comprehend my accent maybe but we had done a trial and she can listen very well but she wasn‚Äôt able to detect the specific stations that I wanted to listen to where is my Google mini I would still wake up the Google mini and ask her to play a certain station and they would do it with no hesitation for that reason I‚Äôm giving this a three star just because it wasn‚Äôt what I expected I had the same expectations a headache experience with my Google mini where else it is a very much louder speaker it doesn‚Äôt have the same features as the Google mini where is my And on top of that just to let you guys know my Google mini I actually got it I believe in clearance it was only $15 at Walmart and the charcoal echo I was able to get it I am for with like a promotion and everything so I came up I am free but it‚Äôs a $50 Alexa speaker you would think he could do a lot more where as the Google mini where is like around $30 if you were to buy at full price I still did a lot better in exceeded my expectations before owning any type of listening devices that can help you on your day to day I also did a test him of putting the two speakers together I am where Alexa would alwaysAsked to repeat the question or she would just completely not do what I was asking her to do one of the cool things that it does have is it has jokes I guess and her voice is a lot more pleasant in the Google minis and you can actually change the settings of the language you were to speak Spanish or something it can speak to you in Spanish as well but I since I usually speak in English it was in so much but yes that is my review	3	July 23, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Not Amazon's best foot forward.Got caught up in this product with a Music Unlimited promotion. Not worth it.The speaker's aren't that good, and Alexia is a joke. I tell her to turn up the volume and she turns off. I tell her to turn off and she gives me the local weather.Not good.I really only got this to use it for waking up to the radio. That was because the last traditional clock-radio I got broke within two weeks.I'll probably never buy an Alexia device again.	3	September 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I replaced an Echo dot Gen. 1 with a Gen 3.  I want my Gen 1 back.  The Gen 3 might be better at playing music because of the bass, but I have a stereo and a cell phone for music.

Echo Dot	We've been messing around with certain features and deciding what we like, love, dislike, and just loathe... but... I think the hardest part for me has been the sound quality.

Echo Dot	Ok, I honestly love Amazon and 3 stars would normally be a little harsh for such an inexpensive product that has such impressive capabilities, but this is one of Amazon‚Äôs premier products and it has some infuriatingly annoying issues that I can hardly even believe. And you cannot get an answer for resolving half the issues you ask about online or the answers are outdated/wrong.Turning volume up and down is laughable for a ‚Äúhands-free‚Äù device. There are basically only two options:1. ‚Äúturn up/down‚Äù and it alters the volume so little you basically can‚Äôt even hear the difference, so you have to tell it to do so 4 times before it makes a noticeable difference (if you own an echo, you will know that this is time-consuming as there is a wait time between each command).2. ‚ÄúTurn way up/down‚Äù (or some other magnitude modifying word) and it changes it by like 85%3. There is apparently no 3rd option. The 3rd option should be to turn it up/down 25% (or fill in blank), but I have tried this with every thinkable percentage and it clearly doesn‚Äôt factor in whatever percentage I tell it. I mean like come on! This should be so basic for a solve-all device that is supposed to be hands-free.Ring Doorbell connection: if you set this up with your Ring doorbell, or similar product, you cannot set a separate volume for it (I‚Äôve tried). So we have had probably 20 occasions in just a couple months where the doorbell was rung and we didn‚Äôt even hear it because we had previously turned the volume down to ~20% for listening to background music.Changing rooms. This is more just an example of many smaller nuisances, however this one was infuriating. Someone got us a new 3rd generation echo dot for Christmas, so we wanted to move our old 2nd generation to a different room and relabel it on the app, and put the new one in it‚Äôs place. The information online for how to do this was next to nothing, and what little there was was outdated. And I kept getting all these links for changing location (address) when I was searching for how to change rooms. I finally just factory reset it and set it up all over again, but this time in a different room. Also annoying.Im not going to list every single issue, but there are a lot of other things that should totally be intuitive and easy, but they aren‚Äôt, or just as likely they are impossible, but you just don‚Äôt know it until you‚Äôve tried it ten times. I and I have no idea why this is the case. I love Amazon, and overall the Echo Dot has been a fantastic addition to our home, but Amazon needs to step up their game. These are issues you would expect out of brand new tech made ten years ago.	3	January 7, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I have had an Alexa/Echos and Echo dots for 7 years. Within the past 3 years: it has decided what questions it wants to answer or what music it wants to play. It has said numerous times ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel comfortable answering that‚Äù‚ÄúHmm i don‚Äôt know that‚Äù‚ÄúI would rather not answer that‚Äù‚ÄúSorry I can‚Äôt help you with that question‚Äù‚ÄúHmm im not sure‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to answer that‚ÄùThe worst, being right after the overrun of Roe VS. Wade when I did not have a computer of tv to see the news. I asked her what had happened, who the justices were who signed, what it meant.. etc.. she said hmm I don‚Äôt know that one, I don‚Äôt know how to answer that, the last time I asked her she said ‚ÄúI would rather not answer that‚ÄùI have asked her about certain religions, human anatomy, psychological and sociological questions that she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt feel comfortable asking‚ÄùIt‚Äôs absolutely appalling that Alexa has developed a moral code, ethics, an opinion, preference and most of all ‚ÄúAlexa are you Christian‚Äù‚ÄúI don‚Äôt follow a certain religion but according to‚Ä¶ in the Bible it says‚ÄùAI is not supposed to develop ethics, or bias.Amazon is illegally marketing and advertising Alexa as technology that‚Äôs Ai that will provide whatever you ask,Also she decided what music I can play or not even if it‚Äôs on Amazon music. I‚Äôve had enough and Amazon hangs up on me every time I have called about it.An AI builds algorithms based on your likes, search history.. etc. algorithms do not include controlling content or not providing you with factual information.I know other people have experienced this and I surely hope anyone whom has comments here.What I‚Äôve continually paid for is not what the TOS or TOC, marketing, warranty, guarantee, information or promises that are included with the purchase of an Alexa Echo or echo dot. Any generation. In the past 15 months I have called Amazon and they told me they appreciate the feedback 01 representative told me that Alexa It‚Äôs still learning about human anatomy. Since April 2021 I have called Alexa support 12 times; I have done been put on hold for a supervisor and every single time I have been hung up on it with no call back after. I have also had Amazon packages that were tampered with that I had removed from my doorstep within one minute of an Amazon driver dropping it off and I‚Äôm still waiting on a response I have five items one from November 2021 that they still will not respond nor did they refund me. I am so aggravated and frustrated that I was trying to learn even about a amendment that was overturned and I am not even able to receive that information from Alexa as a US civilian	1	August 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"If it wasn't a hassle to have to get out my phone or tablet to do something, I'd completely get rid of them.  Not one single time in 2 years have any of them turned off the microwave when I say ""turn off the microwave"". I have to say ""turn on/off the kitchen"". The microwave and the Dot are the only devices in the kitchen. I've reported it numerous times and no one tries to fix it. 50% of the time it does what I ask of it with no problems. And can I be mad at it when it doesn't hear me from 2 feet away??? NO! That's on Amazon, for giving it crappy ""ears"". Listen to the recordings and they're dirty, not clear.  These things are crap and not worth the money spent on them.  Fix them or charge half as much. No way in heck I'd trust it with my front door and thermostat."	3	July 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	If I would have read up on it than I wouldn‚Äôt of gotten it. It‚Äôs actually pretty stupid it‚Äôs not compatible with certain music apps.Amazon music doesn‚Äôt have some of the songs I enjoy listening to which is where other music apps come into play.Also I find myself screaming a lot for Alexa to even respond.As far as the skills; I‚Äôve set up a few skills to which Alexa has to responded to, although the time after I originally used the skills Alexa stated I had to set up said skill. Which made absolutely no sense as it was initially set up.Glad I got this for the price I did because I don‚Äôt  find screaming at a electronic device useful just to get it to cooperate.	3	July 27, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I was given this device by my apartment management as part of a tech upgrade. It was supposed to allow voice control of my thermostat and door lock (both of which were also replaced as part of the upgrade).The big assumption today, I've noticed, that big companies make is that EVERYBODY has a smartphone.I do not.So, there is no way for me to get these devices to interact. There is no pc app, no website help. No plans for that to ever change.Outside of that, what do I think of the device? Well, it is a fun toy.While the audio is high quality, unless you plug it into a stereo sound system it will always be mono. I understand that if you buy a second one they can cooperate to give you a stereo experience. But I am currently hard-pressed to justify owning one.The instruction leaflet that came in the box seems to be minimalist by design to force you to go online in an effort to find out what sort of things it can do. One of the first things you are encouraged to do is install the app on your phone.I still don't have one of those phones.So I settled for installing Alexa on my pc.  Once you do that, It enables your computer to do everything that the Dot can do, plus you can see what you are doing on a screen. Even less justification for keeping the Dot plugged in.Alexa doesn't always hear what I say correctly. And as the device is capable of making purchases on my verbal command, I do live in fear that it might invisibly sign me up to money-draining services I did not ask for.It does have certain preset ""skills"" that, so far, work. I do, however, have a problem with creating a skill online that I want it to have. It just refuses to do it and offers no explanation as to why not.It is supposed to work with other online services (notably Amazon-owned ones), yet I've noticed it is very picky with allowing me to hear certain radio stations in my TuneIn account, but not others.A big annoyance is not being able to find an easily readable definitive source of info that will tell me, at a glance, everything that the device is currently able to do or can do for a price. The first piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned that forces you to dig like an online gopher for any scrap of data you can get. There are manuals available for purchase. I'm just not convinced that I want to spend a penny more on something I already know or is useless for me to know. I'm not somebody who buys a pig in a poke.Bottom line: It is fun to verbally play with. Beyond that it offers me nothing that isn't better handled by my pc."	3	September 9, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"I got this with a Ring Alarm bundle or I would never have bought it. But, I was curious to jump into the Alexa ""echosystem.""My journey started with looking for an alarm system as I live alone and occasionally travel for extended periods of time. I chose the Ring system partly because of my perceived better integration with Alexa (since Amazon did buy Ring, afterall).Current Amazon/Ring setup:Ring basic alarm kitRing spotlight battery camRing Doorbell 2Echo Dot (3rd gen)Echo Show 5Fire Tablet 7 (2019)Fire TV 4K (the short box version that was first to offer 4K, whatever generation that is)Pending additions:Ring Peephole cam (prob swapping out the Doorbell 2)Echo FlexHave my eye on:Echo (3rd gen) or Echo PlusEcho subwooferEcho StudioFire TV Cube (2019)As an Alexa point, the Dot does its job. The mic works and Alexa talks through the speaker.The sound quality is terrible for music. Compared to the Show 5, the Dot is slightly better balanced. The highs sound more tinny on the Show 5, and, while there is ever-so-slightly more bass, the Show 5 is ever-so-slightly more muddy than the Dot. In comparison to a JBL Flip 4 or UE Boom 2, the sound of both the Show 5 and Dot is inferior--and that's saying something because I'm quite disappointed with both the Flip and Boom in regards to price/sound quality (I recommend going with a B+O, Klipsch, Bose, etc. if you are looking for better sound in a similar size package--or maybe the UE Megaboom series in a size larger.).The Dot and Show 5 can be added to multiroom music groups through Alexa. This could be of value if one were to connect them to external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out jack on either device. I intend to do just that with an Echo Flex I have on order.If there were some equalization controls, these could be useful for softer, dispersed through-the-house music, but Amazon/Alexa don't seem to offer such features. That specifically is disappointing when using Amazon Music on my phone bluetoothed to my JBL Flip 4s because when I use Apple Music (which includes some equalizer controls), the JBL Flip 4s become somewhat bearable to listen to.I didn't realize how much I would like having a clock, and for that feature the Show 5 is nice. I haven't had a clock in my house except for the stove and microwave in years. For that feature alone though, I'd like to see the Echo Dot Clock come in charcoal or grey, which I would buy over the non-clock Dot.If you are looking for a device for listening to music without additional external speakers, I'd skip the Dot altogether, opting instead for one of the larger Amazon-branded Alexa devices or a reputable speaker brand device that has integrated Alexa functionality. With external speakers, you have a lot of options amongst the Echo devices, and the Dot could be a contender (cheaper with a deal or bundle maybe?) vs the Input, Flex, or Show devices."	3	November 23, 2019	1

Echo Dot	"I purchased 3 dots and 1 show to automate things in my home. I have several products from different manufacturers (Ring, Sengled, Schlage, etc.) and I wanted to combine automation in one place instead of accessing different apps every time I wanted to do something.I found Skills and Routines are hit and miss. Even though the skill is available, or the routine allows you to choose options, they are not really supported by the system. Here is an example:I tried to set up my Foyer lights (Sengled) to go on when motion is detected through the motion detector (Ring). I can select all the options in the Routine and if I ""play"" the routine, the end result (lights go on) work.  However the automation doesn't. When the motion detector senses motion, the routine doesn't trigger.I tested this with other items in my household, and although they work separately, they will not interact with each other.  I called technical support and after the rep seemed like a deer on headlights when assisting me, he said he would have to ""research the issue"" and would call me back in 15 minutes or so. Two days later after not receiving a call back, I called again and this time the rep promptly told me that third party devices do not work with each other in routines as that is not supported right now.....big miss!I know technology is not perfect and companies are always working on further develop their products, however this is to me an essential part of an automation device...integrate all functionality with the services/products you support.I have to add that individual automation of devices works well. For example I have lights  outside my house to turn on at dusk and turn off at dawn, or my living room lights to turn off at a certain time of the night.Another issue we have is the communication between devices. I ""drop in"" some times to ask my wife or mother in law questions and 90% of the time the drop-in communication is muffled and they can not understand a word I am saying. It also happens when they initiate communication.  Music sounds pretty good out of the echo devices so I don't think is a speaker issue, and voice commands are recognized no problem so I don't believe is a mic issue either. My WiFi connectivity usually clocks at around 270Mbps so I know it is not my connection.Finally, skills. I created a skill from scratch that would give me a countdown for a trip we will be taking. The skill works great when I interact with Alexa directly. However, once again, Routines leave a lot to be desired. The skill does not even show in my skill list when creating the routine. This doesn't make the feature of skills pointless but once again, the ""automation"" part leaves a lot to be desired.I may edit my review if/when all these functions are implemented, but for the time being I think this product has quite a bit of ""room to grow""."	3	February 5, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Speak very clearly or else the Alexa AI will misinterpret what you‚Äôre asking of it.

Echo Dot	"I can't stand this anymore.  It's like torture.  It seems Amazon is purposely trying to make Alexa as annoying as humanly possible.  Add an item to your grocery list and it now tells you bought repeatedly.  For mayonnaise.  WHO CARES.  SHUT UP ALREADY.  It NEVER stops talking even though I have it on ""brief"" mode.Everything now is what you ask for but it adds ""By the way..."" and tells you some other lame garbage you HAVE to listen to.Imagine a light switch or door knob or electrical outlet that argues with you and interrupts you constantly, and talks loudly and for prolonged periods when you need it to be quiet (like when you hear a strange sound outside your house at night in the dark).  That's Amazon Echo.I'm updating this now at the end of January 2022 because now when you say something as simple as ""Alexa/Echo/Computer, play classical music,"" instead of just playing it now tries to let you know there's a new album of some classical composer's work and you can subscribe to Amazon's music service -- blah, blah, blah, ALWAYS talking instead of just DOING.""You don't control this.  It controls you.And if you think you're just adding an item to your groceries list, think again.  I'm sure there's an associate file at Amazon keeping tabs on what you but, how often, and so on, and that that too will get more invasive (and argumentative) in time.Cumulatively all of these issues plus the ongoing privacy concerns, and this is definitely leaving me looking into alternatives.I might have been curious about adding Echo to my driving experience, but is that going to be just as non-stop talkative (and argumentative) WHILE you're DRIVING?  No thanks.Amazon is going down a design rabbit hole.  If CONSTANTLY pissing off customers is the goal, congratulations, you've succeeded.This is exactly what happened with other online sites such as auction sites.  You could easily and quickly list things and turn them into cash, but month after month some techie and manager had to justify their jobs and salaries so instead of being a streamlined experience those products because extremely time consuming to use and no longer justified listing items unless they justified your time spent in getting them sold.  That's exactly what's happened with Amazon.I just wanted something so I could go into a room and turn on multiple lights at once, and turn them off.  Or turn them on when I'm not home so it looks like I am.  The music was fine when you could say something like ""play classical"" and it said only what station or playlist it was playing and then the music started.  Now it's truly invasive and blatantly designed not to serve you, but to give you enough utility that you'll put up with constant ads and pushes for more and more and more.I'll turn on my own damned lights all around the room before I'll put up with and submit to normalizing THIS.Does Dyson sell a vacuum cleaner that argues with you and interrupts you and suddenly announces for no reason in the middle of the night that it's connected to your iPhone?  No.Imagine using a KitchenAid mixer that argued with you and interrupted when you're juggling two parts of a recipe and with critical timing.  That's what Amazon's Echo is like.  Just when you think it can't get more argumentative and invasive, it does.George Orwell got 1984 wrong.  People will submit willingly to Big Brother in the name of convenience.  What Amazon fails to understand, is that's only true up to a point, and the entire Amazon Echo experience has jumped the shark.There's got to be a better alternative out there and I'm determined to find it and get this unwanted, never shutting up ""houseguest"" out of my life for good.Enough!"	1	October 28, 2021	0

Echo Dot	It's a speaker not the best the Google home nest has better sound quality but hey it's a speaker	3	September 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I don't know what but it just leave more to be desired. The sound quality is good but its just not enough if that makes sense. Also, I feel its a bit intrusive with recording what i say and storing it. I absolutely hate that so i unplug mine when I'm not around which in all honesty defeats the entire purpose of the device. I also wish privacy and security options were more in depth and allowed further control. Like, I want to tobsay this person in this family group can access only this in formation at said time on said network etc. And lately the skills minus few are a bit hokey. I wish there were more useful and more productive skills along a norenoractical means as opposed to silly ones that don't really accomplish much such as play rain sounds or give me a nick name. Conclusion; in the lineup oflike devices Amazon is definitely the leading contender but when your in a class of useless gimmicks your still just a gimmick. Just my opinion and it's based on the simple fact I can do everything and more with my phone without am echo device and save myself 50 bucks. Lastly, I have google fiber service and never have issues for the most part and it's wicked fast however my dot has the worst connection of any device obhave ever connected to it. Simply putbits connection is unstable and unreliable with evidence of my other devices history along with trouble shooting I can only deduce its an issue with the device and not the network.	3	December 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I bought this echo dot because it was on sale. I have no problems with the Echo 4, ( except I can‚Äôt set the time zone), but this son of a gun came ready to fight.My other dot is in my bedroom since my Google Assistant is in the living space.Now that I‚Äôve updated my tv to a Fire TV, I opted for the dot to allow me to use the remote even less.  The voice commands across the room are also handy.But what the actual French toast is up with the Chinese (?) commentator when it is set to English and had 20 minutes earlier responded to me in English.I traveled with it back to the USA and that‚Äôs when the bat cave went wild‚Ä¶granted the time zone headache got corrected.It‚Äôs a great device but moody can‚Äôt done!!  Sometimes she responds, sometimes she responds before I have asked the question, sometimes she can do complex problems, sometimes she claims she can‚Äôt understand anything you‚Äôre saying and refuses to try. Sometimes she pretends to be sleeping when I‚Äôm talking to her‚Ä¶She a great help and a stress.If you don‚Äôt want to turn off life individually and like to control everything from bed, this is it. Also, if you never want to know peace‚Ä¶she‚Äôll do that too."	3	July 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I‚Äôll be returning it because every day for the month that I‚Äôve had it, it loses the wifi for no reason.  I tried to get help but when I did the tech wanted $29.99 from me and then he said he‚Äôd help me out. I told him I didn‚Äôt have the money and all of a sudden, the phone went dead.  I tried fixing it with no luck. I really like it too.	3	August 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	In my opinion I have tried a bunch of different voice assistants and they all need lots of work.  I have a lot of home animation but I still prefer motion sensors door sensors and even my phone or iPad over voice.  I actually forget that I can even use my voice most of the time do the fact that it doesn‚Äôt always 100% work. Where my motion and door sensors are 100% accurate.  For my hue lights I like  motion detectors also Philips Hue Smart Dimming Kit.Once you set up your home with motion detectors and door sensors. Like for example opening my closet door the light automatically comes on or when we walk into the bathroom the lights automatically come on because the motion sensor turns them on.  After having these automations with motion detectors and door sensors voice seems kind of an extra step that is not even needed.I do think the best thing that I have found to use the echo and Google hub  devices for is in the kitchen to set timers for when your hands are not able to touch a screen.  Also setting alarms are pretty easy and very reliable.  Probably the biggest thing that I use the echo for is to alert me when I get an Amazon package also it‚Äôs set to ring if someone is at the door ringing the doorbell.	3	January 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Works to good, apparently while I was asleep I woke up for a few minutes but wasn't really coherent, idk what I said if anything to activate the Alexa controller device however, it recorded several minutes of me babbling on about dropping my medication box all over the floor. It was then sent out to my friends that had a Amazon device, there friends and family and god knows where else, apparently it had used my contacts to send that voice message to my friends, family and everyone in my contacts, it also somehow sent the voice message to my friends contacts and there contacts and so on n so on. I turned off my Amazon Dot that day after several of my friends called me to ask ""What's going on, at 7:00am or so I was woken up by a long babbling message from you, one friend said his sister got it to, idk his sister. Be careful ppl, I've since gone into my Amazon account/Devices/Recordings and found hundreds if not thousands of voice commands,  messages etc etc, I deleted them all and deregistered my several devices that I no longer own, I didnt know they stay connected until you remove them and all the data retrieved by them. Very dangerous device if not properly and thoroughly setup completely, read all of the instructions, follow them and, goto a non Amazon site for tips, ideas and what and what ""*NOT TO DO*"", Sincerely, an embarrassed, frustrated and unhappy Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation (What not to do) previous user."	1	February 11, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"After having had a Google Home Mini for about a year, but not being super impressed with it i figured i'd try the deal Amazon had to get an Echo Dot for $1 with a music subscription. Unfortunately i was entirely unimpressed with both.After setting up my dot, and linking it to the smart bulbs in my living room, i tried seeing what Alexa could do. Turns out, not much. Not only did it not understand the sample commands printed in the scant instruction book or Alexa app like ""Alexa, set lights to Green"", when it DID decide to actually do something, it would only control ONE bulb at a time.""OK"" I thought ""Lets see how it handles my new Music Unlimited sub."" Again, VERY poorly. There were a few albums worth of music already in the account, added automatically based on CDs i had ordered in the past (very nice feature BTW) so i asked Alexa to play some specific songs. Pretty much every single attempt was a complete dud. So next i tried getting Alexa to play my favorite podcast. Again, near complete failure. It took the dot multiple attempts to figure out i was asking for a podcast, and NOT a song with a similar title, despite me adding the word ""podcast"" in first at the beginning, then the end, and once, not at all. 4th time was the charm apparently, and i finally manged to get Alexa to play the podcast i wanted. Turns out though, that you can't request a specific episode, or episode title.Finally, i decided to try setting up a routine, something simple. I set up a hypothetical morning wake up routine, where Alexa would turn on my lights and ramp the brightness up to 100% over 5 minutes (something basic, front and center in the menu), and noticed that for some reason you couldn't set a color this way. Okay, white it is i guess. I also wanted Alexa to play a song as well. Well, turns out there's no option to ramp the volume on a song up, at least not in a normal way that i could see. So instead of setting up ONE routine that started about 5 minutes before i got up, and slowly increased in intensity, i had to make TWO routines. One for lights, and a second for the music 5 minutes later.I turned off my smart lights (not via switch, but via app, gotta have actual power to the things for them to work after all) and waited for the routine to kick in. At the appointed time when my living room lights were supposed to come on, imagine my surprise when only ONE light comes on. About 45 seconds later the second light finally comes on. BOTH lights are at around 75% brightness. Now, silly me i had assumed that the lights would start at basically off and go from there, gradually. Nope, almost fully bright, then every minute or so ONE bulb would suddenly click a few degrees brighter, followed by the other 30-40 seconds later.It's at this point i should mention that you cant set an entire room's worth of lights to do anything other than be on or off. So i couldn't just, say, have my entire Living Room group turn the lights on, then ramp up. No, that would be too useful. INSTEAD, you have to set each device INDIVIDUALLY. So i had to set the turn on at a set time, then ramp up in brightness over a period of time for one bulb, then do the same for the other.When it was time for the music to kick in, it decided ""Screw it, who cares if you set it to play from the Echo Dot. Let's play from the phone instead."" Literally every step of a very simple routine was an absolute failure.For being on the 3rd generation of Echo Dot the thing is pretty much like a beta-test product. The Alexa app is borderline useless, integrates poorly with the Echo Dot, and functions erratically when it DOES decide to try working."	2	May 17, 2020	0
Echo Dot	You have to almost shout for her to hear you most days but beyond that pretty great	3	September 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Easy to install. Alexa talks sporadically without warning. She is not as intelligent as Google.	3	September 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	First, this is relatively new technology, and seems to have LOADS of bugs.  When Echo works, it can be quite convenient.  The set up process for each device is a bit of a pain as every manufacturer is a little different and wants you to use their app.  That wouldn't be so bad, but be aware, my experience is that I have to re-set up my devides every month.  Not the same ones mind you.  Sometimes it is the Gosund plugs, then the Sengled lights, or Cync, or another one I forget now.  In retrospect, buying all the exact same manufacturer plugs and lights would likely help, but in theory, all this is supposed to be easy, and it is...until I go through my monthly or more often re-setup.  And, don't forget that if your internet goes down, Echo shuts down also  One would think that would only disable the info features, but nope, Alexa does nothing if she can't talk to the internet.  All your convenience disappears.  The intercom aspect is handy, and overall, I like the features and use Alexa daily.  I also end up cursing Alexa almost daily when I am fighting with it to understand a phrase, repeating myself, doing re-setups, etc.  At some point, a lot of this will likely be worked out.  Just be aware we are not there yet and you should be tech-friendly, as I am, or I imagine this will be nightmarishly difficult.	3	December 7, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"This is really more a review of Alexa than of the Echo Dot. The Echo Dot is a decent speaker. For it's price, I'd even go so far as to call it a good speaker. But if you're like me, you're really buying the Dot so that it can host Alexa and turn your house into a ""smart house."" DON'T BOTHER.Alexa is dumb. Really dumb. And you can't even teach her to be smart, because basic if-then logic is completely beyond her. The programming is entirely set up for ""when"" commands. For example, you can program her to wake you up WHEN it is 6 AM.  But you can't program her to wake you up only IF you are at home. So if you go on vacation, your wake up routine will run, turn on all your lights, raise the thermostat in your house and so on and so forth EVEN THOUGH Alexa knows you're not at home. She knows your location, she'd just not smart enough to use it.Unless you've seen the skill you want to use EXPLICITLY displayed in a commercial, assume that she cannot do it.  Even if you have seen the exact skill you want, you should assume that it will not work as smoothly as shown. You can program a wake up routine, but you can't tell Alexa, ""Run my wake up routine at 6 AM tomorrow instead of 5:30 AM."" No, you have to go in and manually change the programming.  You can't program her to something every other Friday, only every Friday like clockwork or not at all.Here's a short list of things Alexa doesn't do:*Take action only IF something is true. NO if-then functionality at all.*Alter routines*Do tasks on a non-weekly schedule. NO every-other week, no once-a-month, no second-tuesday.*Play music for 30 minutes and then switch off.  Or do anything at all after playing music. Once the Echo Dot starts playing, Alexa is done.*Do a task at a repeated interval (i.e.: Announce the time every 10 minutes)*Play a shuffled playlist as part of a program or routine.*Ask you a question.  Seriously, she can't use any info you give her to take an action. It's dumb.*Regurgitate basic facts you've asked her to remember.*Lock the front door, even when it's a smart lock with an app and everything.Understand, we didn't just roll over and accept defeat.  I'm an engineer. Writing Excel programs is a significant part of my job description. I spend my days beating computers into submission and tricking them into all sorts of things they don't want to do. I was not about to accept that Amazon was dumb enough to put their brand name on a program and interface as monumentally stupid as Alexa was appearing to be. Surely, there was something I was missing. Surely, there was a way to make things work.I started by looking for skills, but didn't really see any that looked like what I wanted. So I went over to skill builder. Still no luck. So I escalated again, and went to the skill builder section intended for large companies. I thought, ""I'm an engineer. I program all day. I can handle it."" Except that apparently, ALEXA can't handle it. Even in the basic, backdoor coding of ""skills,"" available for high-dollar companies trying to build skills for Alexa to use, you can't use conditional statements. No if-then loops. No while loops. Alexa just doesn't function that way.I have depression. I have a roommate with executive dysfunction, one with ADHD and one with Autism. We all pitched in to get the Dot, as well as a bunch of other things to make the house a ""smart house."" Lights, thermostat, plugs, everything. No holds barred.  We were really hoping that Alexa would be able to help us with various basic tasks that we find difficult to manage for one reason or another. We were hoping that this new technology could help make us more functional. We spent all weekend installing the ""easy install"" light switches and thermostat.  We were so excited to get it all programmed and running. In the end, we were monumentally disappointed. The only reason we haven't returned everything is that pulling it all back out of the walls is quite literally more than any of us can handle.I can't believe Amazon has released this product/program and is actively associating their name with it. I can't believe that Alexa has been on the market as long as it has and is still this dumb. If-then statements are the most basic building blocks of programming. How, HOW do you release a program that's intended to be customized, and NOT include basic if-then logic capability?tl;dr - if you want a speaker that will announce the time on command, buy this echo dot. If you want it to make your life easier, give it a pass. At least until Alexa can understand something as simple as ""Alexa, if no one is home, turn off the lights."""	1	February 17, 2020	0

Echo Dot	This is my first Alexa.  A OralB rep gave it to me when an OralB brush with Alexa, would not function as it was suppose to.  The Alexa with the toothbrush kept disconnecting. I‚Äôm having to learn a new way to speak, It‚Äôs not easy learning the apps I could connect with.  I simply want local news and tried to say the name as described by a local station, and It kept going to CNN or another news provider.  I‚Äôve tried listening to apple music, but I‚Äôm not home much to enjoy it.  I tried games and meditation skills.  The trivia game was fun, I was able to challenge other owners.  The meditation music was odd.  Not at all calming. The sleep app did put me to sleep once. I‚Äôm not impressed with Alexa.

Echo Dot	It is a  somewhat cool product, but there are clearly issues in operation.Smartlight.It found my Philips Hue Go lamp and could control it. At first. Then lost the connection and in spite of having it discover devices and finding it, it then failed to communicate. Many attempts of that and it finally worked again. And if can of course just select base colours, the moods the Hue has in the app won‚Äôt work. So functionality with the Hue smart lights is somewhat limited, the AI of the Echo isn‚Äôt good enough.SpotifyAttempt 1. Holy s**t, what a mess! I have a playlist on my Spotify. I use that because you can add whole albums to it, so it is the normal way to do it. Also I can pick different playlists for different purposes. Of course just the way a music service having playlists is supposed to work. But with the Echo it failed 100 %. When I asked it to play my playlist it either played some raining song (far from my kind of music too) or some Spotify radio station. If I asked it to play Suppers ready with Genesis it played ‚ÄúGenesis radio on Spotify‚Äù. If I asked it to play my liked songs it played, yes you guess correctly, something random that I do not like. After a while it started to play ‚Äúdaily mix one‚Äù. Hmmm‚Ä¶..Attempt 2. I unlinked and relinked the Spotify account and after that it works better. But not as it should. I can now actually get it to play the song I ask it to or the artist I ask for. That‚Äôs an improvement. But my playlist, nope won‚Äôt work. If I ask it ‚ÄúAlexa, play my playlist One‚Äù it tells me ‚ÄúPlaying your liked songs‚Äù. And it does play my liked songs. Only thing, to get my music there I have to add every single song manually, which is quite a lot. And of course I can only have one library liked songs, I can‚Äôt use different playlists.So that‚Äôs where I stand now. It works, but only to play Liked songs. Using a playlist seems to be impossible for me, and that is in my opinion a severe functionality problem. I think for a Spotify user Google Home is a better alternative since google Assist seems to work better with Spotify.Maybe using Amazon Music works better and Amazon makes the functionality with Spotify inadequate on purpose. But for me Amazon Music is not an option. And if there is an alternative for Spotify on the device, you‚Äôd think it should be able to play playlists.All in all these things lower the grade quite a lot.	3	February 19, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I have to scream for my alexas responce i dont recommend it.	3	September 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have an Echo Dot 1st Generation and a 2nd Generation Echo.  I decided to update both Echo's and add to my household for more quality and help from Alexa.  I had noticed that the speaker of 1st generation dot was starting to sound a bit off, like a cracked speaker, and Alexa wasn't responding as well as before (but she heard me better than this new one), hence the update of the dot.  And the upgrade for the original Echo 2nd Generation was because of the Zigbee hub (I updated to Echo Plus 2nd Gen).  That all being said...The Echo 3rd Generation Dot in the kitchen doesn't hear me very well (the old one did a better job).  Many times I will ask Alexa to add things to my shopping list and she gets it totally wrong or I hear the new Echo Plus 2nd Generation in the other room pick it up.  Also if I tell her to set a timer in the kitchen, again many times she doesn't hear me or the other one will pick it up.  I figure the reason the other Echo (in another room) hears me is because I am having to shout at Alexa to do what I am asking; set a 10 min timer, add eggs to the shopping list, ect.  Very annoying!Not to be all negative on the 3rd Generation, if I do play music on the Everywhere Group setting it isn't to bad sounding, but it is in my kitchen (my hub) and I need to be able to request to her to add things to the shopping list, set timers and she needs to be able to hear it correctly and not make me shout at her.Lastly, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation sound quality (when she does hear you) is way off.  I have tried repeatedly to bring up the sound quality (less base / muffled sound) for use in just the kitchen.  The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is way to muffled sounding, and sadly this one is going somewhere in the household where it will be rarely used and I will bring the old one back out of retirement...at least I could understand the Echo 1st Generation more, with no muffled sound, and she heard me way better than the Echo 3rd Generation.  I am disappointed in this Echo 3rd Gen Dot and glad it was on sale, per it wasn't worth the 50.00 original asking price.  I do enjoy the Echo Plus 2nd Generation with the Zigbee Hub, but it is in a different room, and I do play music through it.	3	December 8, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The echo dot seemed to respond slow and inaccurate at times....also sound quality not to good to listen to music.	3	August 29, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The sound quality on this and the other one I ordered is not great. It is very bassy, hard to hear, and if you turn it up, its too loud. The voice quality is fine, it is just the speaker that isnt great. But, we use it every day for weather and other info it provides.	3	July 27, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Lamentablemente el enchufe s√≥lo se conecta con la aplicaci√≥n de ALEXA, pero no reconoce otro asistente. Demasiado centralizado este dispositivo. Se supone que un dispositivo es inteligente por tener la capacidad de vincularse con otros y con otras aplicaciones?	3	August 5, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I was given a Gen 2 Dot by a friend who no longer had a use for it. I thought I'd give it a try and went shopping for devices to use it with. I even  bought a new Gen 3 Dot for my second floor. I installed the app on my tablet and got started. Initial set-up was fairly easy, almost intuitive. Voice recognition is very good. The smart devices were another matter. I spent almost an hour trying to get my first bulb working only to discover that it was bad. Switched bulbs and the second worked just fine. Sound quality is good but, oddly enough,  actually better on the older Dot! Over all these Dots seem a lot like the Fire tablet I bought several years ago. Well made, interesting, but little more than an enticement to rent, purchase, or stream content from Amazon. It can't do a thing with the 7000+ files in my audio collection.Home integration has so far been disappointing. 25% of the bulbs I bought are/were defective. They work fine as plain LED bulbs, so they'll get used, but they don't respond to the Dots. And the dimmer switch I bought for our chandelier won't work either. I'm not giving up just yet, home integration/automation is too appealing.	3	January 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"On many many occasions, more often than not, I have to yell loudly at her multiple times for her to ""wake up"". I have repeated the same command many times and she will not recognize sometimes. I was surprised by the quality of sound though! I play music through it and the speaker is rather good for it being so small! Overall rating? 6/10, I'd go for a newer model than the 2018 if that's even a thing. Only say that because hopefully they fixed/tweaked some things! May I also add, it's very creepy when i have to scream at her to hear me but she'll randomly go off in the middle of the night and I go in and listen to what she heard and it's something creepy, one night she heard and recorded ""mother"" when my room was absolutely silent. So maybe turn yours on mute over night üòÇ"	3	May 17, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I like that you can request just about any song and it will play. I do not like that it listens to ALL conversations and starts identifying names with their voice, creepy!	3	August 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I just had to unplug the Amazon Echo Dot in my bedroom. I am a very light sleeper, and this device randomly lights up, blinks, and beeps. I have checked the app on my phone. I have tried asking Alexa to stop blinking. I may not plug it back in. I was using it for white noise, weather reports, and occasional music when I‚Äôm getting ready in the morning. It is much nicer at night keeping her unplugged.	3	July 5, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"Two complaints and one thing of note.- It worked wonderfully. All I did was plug it in. Then one day  got new internet (my portal died). Since then all it does is tell me to download the ap, and it will fix everything. I dl'ed it. Is there a setup button, yep. Connecting it? Not a clue. There is no Connection/Communication button. I have been through every menu of this ap and nothing helps.Complaints- I bought a 2nd Alexa, it works f'ing amazingly well in spite of being about as far as I dare use the wi-fi correctly. It has no connectivity issues, WTF.- Apple: An advertisement that plays every other commercial break where the people say ""Alexa"" that activates mine so it can tell me to DL the ap every 15-minutes...somewhere an advertisement executive needs to be shot.Oh, and one more thing...- I reached the point where I honestly could turn off my alarm to wakeup and still be asleep. No, seriously. I am conscious just enough to find the snooze button but not to become awake. So IO figured ""Hey, why not get an Alexa? I can set and cancel alarms much easier, it confirms them, and in my dream state I cannot speak 'alexa' and I need to be awake to recognize the source, so it will guarantee I wake up."" Problem:Alexa does not have a separate ""alarm volume"" setting. If you want a loud alarm, you need to set it to max volume for everything. I want to here my morning music playing at a 4 or 5 even if it takes a 9 to wake me up."	2	June 21, 2022	0

That‚Äôs probably why they play such horrible football. Them dang Cowboys ain‚Äôt gonna win a super bowl in my lifetime. At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been told.	3	February 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I'VE HAD TWO ORIGINAL ECHO DOT FOR YEARS.  Decided to update, PURCHASED THE THIRD GENERATION.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  STOPS WHEN WE MAKE A PHONE CALL; CHANGES STATIONS AUTOMATICALLY, AND has developed a ""bit of attitude"".  The previous Amazon.Alexis app doesn't work only with the NEWER Alexis  for computers connection.  In fairness, I now have a Wi-Fi connection.  Amazon's CUSTOMER SERVICE is unable to help."	3	July 7, 2022	1

Echo Dot	It‚Äôs our 2nd 3rd gen dot-was purchased to replace 1st gen echo-not even close to the echo, respond, sound, volume-and not as ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù or strong as the older dot , however the $30 w/tax makes it still a good deal	3	July 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I have 12 alexa echo devices in my house.  Mostly dots, but I have a couple of shows as well.  For a long time all was well.  I kept adding to my network.  I have almost every light switch in my house moved to a smart switch.  I can open and close my curtains through alexa, and I have enjoyed using it as an intercom to the kids rooms using the drop in feature.  But recently, she has been getting stupid.Issue 1: Recently, I tried to drop in on my son, by saying, ""Alexa, drop in on [NAME]"".  This has always worked in the past.  Lately, at least half the time, she asks me, ""Do you mean [son's name/daughter's name]?  And I say no.  And she asks me who do I want to drop in on.  I tell her, and she is stuck asking me if i mean something else.  Now, the only think I can think of is that she has access to my phone's address book since my son has my daughter's old phone number.  What the heck?!?!  And Amazon doesn't seem to monitor their own help forums to even provide help.  So scratch that one off the nice feature list.Issue 2:  Forgets some skills, and seems to install others I don't want.  I am using a pretty obscure wifi enable controller to open and close some large curtains.  It worked for over a year.  Then one day, it just stopped working through alexa.  Still works through the manufacturer supplied app.  I looked in my skills, and the skill for that device is just gone.  All of my routines are still there, and refer to the skill in the settings, but the skill isn't there and when I redownload, I can't sync to the original account.  So scratch that off the nice features list.Issue 3:  The most basic smart home control:  Light switches.  I have two rooms that she has become stupid about.  The garage and the study.  I have always been able to say, ""Alexa, turn on/off the garage/study lights.""  And she has done it perfectly until now.  Now most of the time, she responds, ""The garage/study doesn't support that.""  What the heck?  So scratch that off the nice features list.If all you want to do is ask what the temperature is, then go ahead an buy an echo device.  Otherwise, I would say that this is giving amazon a huge black eye.  There are so many similar questions as mine on line, and even on the alexa page right here on amazon.  But amazon doesn't answer the question.  Seriously, this is self-proclaimed to be the most customer-centric company in the world, and you can't get simple trouble-shooting help!"	2	March 30, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Sound is muffled. I upgraded from my first generation echo for a better sound quality. This sound is louder but far more muffled	3	August 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The device is a cool gadget, a nice audio speaker with some smart features. For the most basic users it probably is more than necessary to enjoy audio with some smart functions on the side. Unfortunately if you are a power user, and say decided to have several of these and use 2 each as stereo speakers for your computers, you will realize the few but serious issues; Sound synchronization & annoying, totally unnecessary notifications of which device is connected and currently playing, are a huge deal breaker. The sad part is, that at least the notifications should be an easy fix, but lack a simple functioning switch to prevent that. The audio sync does work well if some app plays the audio, but used on a computer the audio will shift and lag behind (tested with various setups).	3	May 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This review is more about the poor customer service, which is just as important to any merchandise quality.  This dot is less than a year old and a couple months ago a section of the red ring light came on and won‚Äôt turn off.  I have tried unplugging it and resetting it several times but the red light won‚Äôt turn off.  Not only is it annoying, but it causes the echo to get warm since it is constantly on 24/7.  Since Amazon customer service is almost non existent, I‚Äôve had to resort to google searches to try and find a solution, but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any.	2	October 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It sounds like Alexa is speaking from the bottom of a barrel.  Too much bass and not enough high frequencies.  This can be resolved somewhat by using an amplified speaker, such as one of the OontZ models.  Turn the Dot volume down and use the OontZ speaker's amplifier at max.  Then bring up the Dot volume until the output is usable.	3	June 26, 2022	1
Echo Dot	when it works, it's great. I bought 2 smart plugs. The first worked great, then it just stopped, so I bought another new smart plug, from AMAZON that one doesn't work either. Now it stopped playing music. It said it is a router problem, but my router works with all my other electronics. I have tried turning both the alexa and the router off MANY times, no change. I am VERY disappointed. I guess I have to cancel my alexa. I'd really rather not, but it's no good the way it is.	3	June 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs great like the version with the clock on them better	3	August 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I was disappointed because I wanted a small Bluetooth speaker to use on the go. I work in a different location every day and it requires a Wi-Fi set up everywhere I go, which isn‚Äôt always possible. I might use it at home instead.	3	July 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I don't know if it's the device or Amazon itself. But ever since I purchase this device Alexa Jeopardy has been nothing but a frustrating disaster. I couldn't leave a review on the Jeopardy site so I have to leave it here. Jeopardy on Alexa hasn't worked correctly since I purchased this device. It shuts off in the middle of a game. It skips questions . I absolutely refuse to upgrade, so I guess I'm SOL. So either Amazon is either deliberately messing with the program so people purchase the upgrade or something is wrong with my device. That would be odd, because the same thing is happening on my old device and my friend's new device. So, is Amazon doing this deliberately so people have to purchase an upgrade? Or have they simply been having problems with this for over a month now that they just can't seem to figure out? You take your pick. My ten-year-old could code better. Amazon has reached the point where you have to purchase Amazon in order to purchase from Amazon. You have to purchase Prime in order to purchase shows on Prime. Pretty soon you will have to purchase Amazon in order to purchase Amazon in order to make a purchase through Amazon. How much more money does Jeff Bezos need? Will his lust for money not be satisfied until he's a trillionaire? Or is he bleeding us dry by nickel-and-diming us to death because he's a stingy, greedy man? Amazon, fix your damn products!	3	August 21, 2021	1
Echo Dot	If you just need something to take your aggression out on, this is it! I threw the first one out the door into a rainstorm and was happy after that.....Then, thinking maybe I was hasty or maybe improvements had been made to Alexa, I bought a second Dot. This one makes me crazier than the first. I cannot believe how much time I have wasted trying to pair it with lights, plugs, etc, and if you have set custom answers you have to remember to ask Alexa EXACTLY how you set it up. If you have an IPhone, Siri does the same job 150% better with no setup!Do not waste you time, money, or patience with Alexa!	2	October 2, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"So, I have a slew of 1st and 2nd gen Dots - more than I need, really. But I ended up having a scenario where it would be nice to be able to pair a FireTV with a Dot to pipe the sound through, and looked into the ""Home Theater"" function which pairs a 3rd Gen Dot with newer Fire Sticks and TVs. Short version: it doesn't work, so avoid if that's your intention.---About Home Theater---We have a Fire Stick that the app will see as available to use for Home Theater, but when I try to select this new 3rd Gen Dot it is greyed out and says it is incompatible. I also have another Stick on the same network that isn't that old, but it isn't even an option to try pairing anything to.  I'm so tired of Amazon's ""ecosystem"" of devices working so incredibly poorly with one another.Their Connect voice quality sucks, this feature sucks, the compatibility between generations for something as seemingly simple as playing an audio stream from FireTV on your Dot? Sucks. I'm not sure why they can't get it working on older devices, but that's annoying. What's more annoying is when you buy a product specifically for the task, which Amazon says should work, only to find it doesn't.---Sound Quality---These 3rd Gen dots still sound really quite poor - if you want to listen to music, you'll still have to output them to a dedicated speaker or suffer weak, muddy sound that lacks both clarity and depth. When you compare to something like a $15ish Logitech X50 bluetooth speaker, I have no idea how this thing can be AC powered and still sound so crappy in comparison. It's better than the earlier gens, but that isn't hard to do as the sound quality was quite possibly the worst sound I'd ever heard.---Conclusion---Ultimately, I'm done trying. I'll find another way. The features compared to Google Assistant based speakers are entirely lacking, and the sound quality still isn't good enough. Glad I got this Dot on the cheap because it allowed me to learn not to invest in Amazon devices like this anymore. Each generation ends up siloed from previous ones so you'd have to buy newer ones for simple additions, and even then they don't even work!Disappointing."	3	December 12, 2019	1

Echo Dot	It did everything it said it would and I was amazed with how well it answered questions BUT.. I bought 3 of these and all three only lasted about a year until it started having major problems. The speaker got very static-y, when I would set a timer with it, I couldn‚Äôt add any more time to it but it wouldn‚Äôt tell me that. It would just ring at the initial timer amount set, so needless to say, I had a lot of uncooked meals. And,  It wouldn‚Äôt understand a lot of my simple inquiries that I‚Äôd asked before with no problem. So if you don‚Äôt mind replacing it annually, then it‚Äôs a handy thing to have. The speaker on it is pretty weak though. It‚Äôs better if you can hook up an external speaker to it.My least favorite thing about this Echo Dot is that the ideal volume for me doesn‚Äôt exist..ex: level 4 is too soft and level 5 is way too loud. Oh, and there‚Äôs too much bass in the voice and not enough treble so it‚Äôs hard to understand unless you‚Äôre right close to it. The microphone does have pretty good range though. Sorry that I didn‚Äôt measure how far, but I can‚Äôt do it now bcz they don‚Äôt work as well as they used to.My favorite thing about it is that you can configure it in Settings to not shut down after it answers your question so you can keep talking to it. I like this bcz it‚Äôs habit for me to say thank you after somebody answers my question and when it turns off and I say thank you I‚Äôm talking to dead air so when it hangs around it actually says you‚Äôre welcome or other things that appreciate you.Wow, am I needy!	3	June 19, 2021	1
Echo Dot	The Good: It completes all of the basic tasks as intended.The integration is clever and user-friendly, but it isn't without flaws.With such a small unit, the audio quality is excellent.The voice recognition is also excellent. (To say the least, it's appreciation of my poorly pronounced Spanish sir-names (Music Artists) is amusing.)Small Footprint is small enough to fit almost anywhere without being obtrusive.The Bad: It lacks an internal memory function that allows it to remember and repeat information it has just delivered or performed - you can't ask it to repeat what it has just said. (This shocked me, and I believe it is a significant flaw that should be addressed in future releases.)It doesn't appear to have any logic circuitry, instead relying on a massive database of references and some basic cross-referencing to find and retrieve data with the Alexa integration. It does a decent job most of the time, but with smarter programming, it could be much better.A computer that isn't really intelligent. She's more of a junior librarian/assistant than an AI system of any magnitude. The sound quality could also use some improvement!Overview - a useful tool for mundane tasks such as timers, alarms, and reminders, as well as for fast fact checks (dates, history, latest news about a given person or subject). Notifies you when Amazon deliveries arrive at your door. For others, this could be the coolest thing ever for the house, as it can be used in conjunction with other smart devices to create a 'Smart Home.'But, in my opinion, this device isn't particularly intelligent - merely an adequate tool for performing routine tasks. It's used in this way, and the degree of complexity isn't quite as high as it should be. In my view, the technology is underwhelming.	3	April 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt know how to use it.	3	August 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	My family has two other ones in the house so calling Alexa would set them all off. I changed the name of it so it fixed the problem. Glad they added that option. However, it‚Äôs very sensitive so if I say anything that even sounds like it it will go off. And when I call it when I actually need it it will sometimes ignore me.It also won‚Äôt let me change my alarm tone aswell.Also you can‚Äôt name it you have to choose between the four names it gives you. I wish it would let us pick since my family is already planing to have one in each room (everyone likes to listien to music and so plan to have everyone have one for their each room) and there isn‚Äôt enough name selections and will cause them to have to have the same name :(	3	April 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"TL:DR - This is a perfectly fine bluetooth speaker and well worth what I paid for it (99 cents with an Unlimited Music subscription of 7.99 which you can immediately cancel if you wish) but don't expect voice command functionality to impress.To be frank, I didn't buy this device to listen to the weather, control the lights in my house, or operate a home security system.  My phone can tell me the weather, and light switches and manual locks have worked fine so far.  I got this because I like listening to music or videos while I cook, clean, and work on the computer at my table.  So basically I'm in it for a bluetooth speaker.  And I have to say, it's kind of neat to have a bluetooth speaker that accepts voice commands.  The problem is in how it responds to those voice commands.Me: ""Alexa, set the volume to fifty percent.""Alexa: ""Sorry, you can only set the volume between zero and ten.""Me: ""Alexa, what is fifty percent of ten?""Alexa: ""Fifty percent of ten is five.""This is the problem I've had with every voice assistant I've encountered so far.  You can't speak to them in everyday language using simple concepts that a computer should be able to understand.  Alexa should be smart enough to know that fifty percent is the same as five out of ten.  If you can't give the device simple, direct commands and have those commands be understood, then why have voice control?As far as a speaker goes, this is about what you would expect from a bluetooth speaker of this size.  You're not going to get clear and sparkling highs, but the overall sound is strong and there's the perfect amount of bass response if like me you enjoy music but also live in close quarters and aren't trying to disturb the neighbors.5 stars for Voice recognition - It knows what I'm saying.2 stars for Alexa integration - The device understands my words, but it doesn't know what they mean or act on them.4 stars for Sound quality - I hoped for a bit more clarity, but this is perfectly adequate for a speaker of this size and cost."	3	December 14, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I purchased Alexa because I‚Äôve heard numerous things about how great it is from friends and family and how it supposed to make life easier. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed, but I also won‚Äôt say my expectations were met. My biggest problems with Alexa is how often she turns on or interrupts when she was never called upon. I can be watching a movie or a YouTube video and she turns on and says something. A lot of times I‚Äôm alone and in my bed and that‚Äôs very scary, but that‚Äôs not the worst of it. Around 1:00PM Alexa randomly seems to start reading me the daily news and I‚Äôm soo confused.... I don‚Äôt remember ever setting up something like that. Once again I get scared easily and this doesn‚Äôt help. I also cannot stand the default voice of Alexa. You‚Äôd think that with the amount of money Amazon has that they would allow for you to pick from a wide variety of voices. Alexa sounds too monotone and robotic for my liking. She‚Äôs also a bit high pitched which can be annoying. It‚Äôll be a great improvement if we can get different voices for Alexa! Lastly, I‚Äôm also troubled by the amount of privacy concerns I have read and seen about Alexa. It‚Äôs always on the back of my mind, and it doesn‚Äôt help when I‚Äôm sleeping and I happen to wake up and see a yellow or blue ring around Alexa. I can‚Äôt help but think what it‚Äôs doing. I‚Äôll have to go and check my history. I‚Äôm someone whose very interested in technology, I‚Äôm always looking to try out new tech, and while I‚Äôm glad I tried out Alexa, I can also just as easily live without it.	3	May 28, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"This is a review for the device, and more importantly, Amazon Music and Alexa android apps.I received this as a promotion from Amazon where I got this for 99c with a subscription to Amazon Music at $9.99/mo.First off, the device itself seems pretty nice, the sound quality is good, but voice recognition is lousy. Even after training it.However, as this was to be used for Amazon Music and podcasts, it is beyond useless. Voice recognition doesn't recognize artists names or track titles. After several retries you are better off just going to the Amazon Music app.But, and here is where the issue is, the Amazon Music app and Alexa app are garbage. Absolutely terrible. Amazon Music somehow has screen refresh issues. It fails to load the screen, or goes into some dizzying refresh cycle where it loads over and over and over. That or it just displays a black screen.If you are lucky enough to actually find a track or artist you want to play, then hit the play buttonn, there is a rediculously long delay on the order of 5-10 seconds where it thinks about doing it.And then the buffering, oh the buffering. It appears they don't use one. It repeatedly skips and pauses, even on a a 280Mbs WIFI signal and 4G cell service. Its useless.And then, it will crash on you.And for the Alexa app, it crashes repeatedly. I have to click the ""close app"" button when Android indicates it has crashed in the background. This occurs roughly 4-5x per day.So, here I am with a device that seems capable, but the applications to use with it are garbage. What an ecosystem! Way to go Amazon. Hire some real developers please.I canceled my music subscription immediately. There's $10 wasted. Now I have a device that I was hoping to use for music and podcasts, and now I can't.Avoid if you plan on using this for music streaming."	2	January 19, 2022	0

Echo Dot	Pandemic play toy has become more than just a toy.  I like so much about it that it would be hard to send her packing.  Tried just one to start.  Then had to add 2 more.  Wanted to try the stereo feature and put one in another room. They worked very well for several months until I finally tried to set up the stereo feature.  It has been downhill ever since.  I have told Alexa that she better behave or start packing.I lost most of my programed responses that I added to the Skills or Blueprint.  Controlling my smart plugs failed.  Reset that up and now it is hit or miss.A big issue for me is the capability of asking to play an individual song is no longer available.  Then I have to listen to her long speech about paying for Music Unlimited to have that feature back.  I have never and will never pay a monthly fee to hear music.Now I also have to listen to commercials which never happened in the past.  I have a suspicion that eventually, once many users are hooked, everyone will have to pay to listen to music.I am now resorting to pulling her plug when one of the long sales pitches starts or a commercial comes on.  It takes more time for the re-connection,  but that is how annoyed I feel.Looks like I may have to reset the triplets of Alexa  and start over.I would rather have no stereo and all the functions working like before.	3	April 27, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Edit:Still 3 stars I won‚Äôt give more but definitely will less of it continues to be a frustrating paperweight. Also I never gave consent for Amazon to ‚Äúpool‚Äù my Wifi for my neighbors Sidewalk is a big fat PERMISSION NOT GRANTED!!Original review:I bought this through an Amazon deal at Best Buy. I received 2 for the price of 1 and got 2 smart bulbs as well, during their ‚Äúearly Black Friday deals‚Äù. Let me start by saying I wanted this for 2 reasons and it disappointed on both. 1)To make calls for work to the carriers (most require to push ‚Äúx‚Äù to get to the correct area and this won‚Äôt do that :( ) it works for the carriers I don‚Äôt have to select a choice or to call my account reps ect. Sound quality is spot on and it does a great job on listening in on meetings ect to take notes so I trade one for the other. 2) to use to listen to music and pod casts as I work or sleep. If Alexa would pick a better variety then this would be perfect. But example: I say Alexa play 80‚Äôs music and it chooses the exact same station that plays the exact same songs over and over. If I say ‚ÄúCountry Love Songs‚Äù it plays the Country Love category on my IPhone gahhh. Alexa doesn‚Äôt seem to understand certain things and the routine and tasks I added don‚Äôt seem to work. Idk I will mess with this one a little more as I am new to all of this but it‚Äôs frustrating and may be returned. Best part: you can mute the echo and no accidentally calling or recording a call or conversation and I can ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù and make sure my home is safe when I am away.	3	November 12, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"Pros & ConsPros:- Voice recognition- Easy set up- Wireless Connection- Not bad sound quality- Able to turn off micCons- No internal battery (Did not say it had one)- Software has MANY issues (will go into in review)- Sound is not SUPER loud- Quality deteriorates at high volumeSo I have not had this long, having arrived mid day the just the day prior (had about 1.5 days now) but I have had many issues with it. I thought it would be better, being the third gen. I'll start with the issues with it, and then go on to what I like.I have been using it with Spotify, as well as a speaker for my computer. For Spotify, numerous times it has just not done what I told it. Its playing a playlist, I say ""Play %s from Spotify"", where %s is whatever, does not actually matter. It says Sure playing *whatever said* and then the music pauses for a brief second, and goes back to playing whatever it was playing before, with no change. The device heard me, recognized what I said, acknowledged it was requested to do it, and then did nothing. I would try numerous times in a row, and it would still not do as it was meant to (Again this is a software issue). Next, using it as a speaker. Numerous times it just stops playing sound. I change my speaker back to the built in sound on my laptop, and sound comes out, switch it back to the echo, and nothing. My laptop has no issue having sound come out, and the music is playing, the echo just refuses to output it. I have restarted the laptop, and messed around with the sound settings nothing changes it. I've changed what app the sound is coming out of, still nothing. The solution I've found, is unplugging the echo and plugging it back in, but I could have to do this even up to 3 times an hour. To me, that proves the issue is the echo, not the laptop. Of course, the issue is not always present.So onto the good. The devices voice recognition is honestly not bad, but I would say if you have an accent, lisp, or mumble, it will have lots of issues. Now that may improve with time, but that I cannot speak to. The set up is easy, all it requires is the mobile app, or I believe it can be accessed via a web page. Their is many features/apps one can install so it may interact (aka Spotify). It does not need to be connected to ones phone to work, which is nice. It has a button to turn off the mic, so it will no longer listen/record. I quite like that, but I cannot speak to whether it actually does stop listening and recording, I'd almost be willing to bet it doesn't, but idk.I got it with the special deal with amazon music unlimited, so I spent almost $10 all in all (one month music included). For that price it may be worth it, but I would absolutely not pay 40/50+ for this, especially with all the issues. As a whole not happy with the device so far. If anything changes, I will update this review to reflect.I will say, their customer service is absolutely wonderful. I got a call from them with regards to my issues mentioned above, before this review even went live."	2	June 18, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"We have all been dealing with the exact same issues for a while, without update.I was reserving judgement until they had a chance to update, but that is not going to happen.This is going to pick on the device as an integral part of Alexa.As a stand-alone blue-tooth speaker, It is fine, except for it's lack of battery.However, due to it's lack of battery, I would call that function ancillary.Ups:They are super-easy to get running.Some of the smart home features are really nice, and easy to develop for.Sound quality is excellent (for a tiny speaker).The (occasional) price point can't be beat.The build quality is excellent.Downs (Major):Multi-room audio constantly looses sync or drops devices. This would have been a deal-breaker had I known it going in.There is little to no management of individual devices.The trigger words are often misheard in general conversation, leading to general nonsense.Downs (Minor):Connectivity is an occasional issue, often requiring a manual reboot.(Amazon, if you are listening and tell me to check my network, I will tell you to sit in the corner.)Voice Recognition is functional, but you must know how to address it.The rules:  #1 - Background conversation must not be happening. This includes radio or TV. Volume does not matter.  #2 - Background noise must be as minimal as possible.  #3 - Speak the trigger word, then wait a second before the command. A 2-count is fine.  #4 - Enunciate with exaggeration! Monotone will not pass with Amazon. Use that stage voice!  #5 - Do not pause while speaking the command.Whisper mode is a lie.Amazon knows very little about pricing and information about Amazon services. Don't bother asking.""Internet searches"" are basically a mess. Good luck.Your location will be guessed. It will be wrong. It does this way too often. It ignores what you enter at setup."	3	April 27, 2020	1
Echo Dot	My son bought this for me for Christmas. At first it seemed to work fine. I have terrible ringing in my ears and a little hard of hearing so she is hard to understand sometimes. I wish there was a way to adjust the pitch of her voice.  I do like the sound of the speakers when playing music.  I have reminders set which have worked awesome until today all the sudden they were all had just disappeared. I had to re add them. No clue what happened as my routines were still there. The routines that play music I have a lot of problems with play on my AMAZON PLAYLIST. The routine will either not start or it will cut off short of what was scheduled. This happens for all the music I have set which is 4 of them at various times of day. The routines set that are non music seem to work great like my smart plug. Although I want my volume set to 5 during the day (after playing night music at 2) and when set in the routine she does not do it. I really have a love hate relationship with her at this point as I have to  manually start my songs majority of the time. When I verbally try to get her to play one of my playlists she gets it wrong most the time. I need my sleep music to be reliable due to severe insomnia issues and the music routines are just not reliable on my Alexa. Will go back to using my old boom box for my sleep music I guess.	3	March 3, 2021	1

Echo Dot	"Bought a 65"" Sony TV that said it works with Alexa.  Most important feature was that it works with Alexa.  Was purchased for 95 year old mother in an assisted living facility.

Echo Dot	I just got my new Amazon Dot.  I'm having fun learning all she can do and it's still to soon to really review it but I have very early on discovered a very big, disappointing flaw I have to vent about.  I need to pick up my granddaughter at one time on Mon, Tues, Thurs & Fri and another time on Weds.  Unless I missed something, there is no way to set an alarm/reminder/notification/routine or whatever to do that on the Dot????  It's either every weekday or individually.  I guess once you got each one set up, it wouldn't be that big a deal but what about when her schedule changes, as it often does and you have to do it all over again.  I'll bet there are others out there who have different schedules thruout the week that will find it a pain also.  Or is my situation unique?  Having to set up an individual repeating alarm (or whatever) for Mon, then another one for the same time Tues, then another one for the same time Thurs, then another one for  the same time Fri and then still another different one for a different time on Weds is, ahem, less than ideal.  And you can't even exclude weekends!What were they thinking?  For something as 'smart' as this device is supposed to be, this is a really stupid omission.  Not everyone gets up at the same time everyday and we do have repeating schedules based on given days.  So right now, all my Dot does is turn off/on lights.  Which is cool, yes, but not as helpful as, say, a fully customizable alarm.	3	November 4, 2020	1

Echo Dot	I got this some time back and it‚Äôs a good smart speaker with some problems. I got 2 one for me and one for my mother. Mine is in my bedroom my mothers is in the living room and here are some problems. 1 I ask it to play Spotify and it try‚Äôs to play it on my Xbox, when I try to tell it to play on its self it plays on my mother‚Äôs dot and turns up the volume to max. 2 it does not listen I say Alexa the led ring turns blue, but it stops listening to me even when the room is silent and does not do what I tell it even when I ask 5 times. 3 when I tell it to set a timer for 5 minutes it tells me ‚Äúyou can also enable this skill‚Äù or ‚Äúyou can also say Alexa add 5 minutes‚Äù after the first couple of times is fine but after that is gets annoying. And it will do it every time with almost everything I tell it todo. Yes it‚Äôs worth the money the voice recognition is really good the speakers are excellent and Alexa is great when he is not being annoying.	2	June 8, 2022	0

Echo Dot	"At the urging of my children, we joined the Alexa crowd with the Echo Dot 3rd Gen in the kitchen.  First, the good things.  Installed easily and unobtrusive on the counter.  Can speak to it in a regular voice and it seems to understand both my wife and me without problems.  Able to create lists for various shopping trips, if we can go, without problems.  Able to stream SiriusXM with stations selected on command, as well as Pandora and Spotify.But ....  the sound quality of the Alexa voice is muddy, and sometimes hard to understand.  I boosted the treble and lowered the bass in the equalizer, did not seem to make much difference.  Not clear that mine is defective, as many others seem to have the same problem.  Although it can interface with a Roku, the commands are quite limited; it can run a Roku application, but not control it once loaded, so you still need the remote.  Seeking information, Alexa is often beaten by Google.  For example, I wanted to know when the local NFL team was playing, it was able to give me the time of the game.  But when I asked for the network broadcasting the game, ""I don't have that information"" was the response.  Google Assistant came through with the correct information.  This has happened with other searches as well.  Disappointing.So, overall, Alexa is good, but not great.  Music played through the speaker is acceptable, but not the Alexa voice.  Commands can be limited.  We have one, not sure if I need another."	3	December 20, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I am (unfortunately) fully invested in Amazon devises.  I have at least one echo in every room of my house, and a fire stick on every tv.  A total of 12 echos/dots/shows plus an echo sub and 6 fire sticks.  When they work right, they are a wonder of technology.  For a fraction of the price of a Sonos, you can have whole home audio, plus integration with light switches and bulbs as well as home automation.  I use the echos for my shopping lists, reminders, alarms and timers, as well as checking sports scores and weather and even asking what time it is if I‚Äôm too lazy of roll over and look at my phone.  Firesticks also play nice with echos (for the most part) so in my garage, I have a nice sound system with two echos for atmos stereo sound and a subwoofer connected to my projector and I don‚Äôt need to have any wiring except the hdmi to the fire stick and the power cables running to the echos.  Soooo why 2 stars?  Well, despite all these neat things they can do, that is their job.  That‚Äôs why I have over $500 invested into this system.  Ya, that‚Äôs a good price for what I have but that‚Äôs if these things worked correctly all the time.  Thing is, they only work right about 50% of the time.  Using Alexa is terrible.  It‚Äôs the biggest flaw.  It just doesn‚Äôt hear things right and if it were human, I would say it is one of the most stubborn people I know.  I am constantly repeating commands multiple times.  Sometimes I will be right in front of one talking in a bedroom and you get a response from one two rooms over.  It is an issue with alarms because you don‚Äôt want a kitchen alarm going off in someone‚Äôs bedroom, etc.  the other issue is audio drop-outs.  I will just randomly lose audio in different rooms.  Even right next to the router while other things are streaming.  Then it gets stubborn and won‚Äôt comeback until you go into another room and tell it to start up again in the room you want.  If you don‚Äôt, it will keep telling you it‚Äôs playing what you requested but just goes silent.  Tech support is a joke.  Protocol for everything is (turn everything off, router, modem, firesticks, echos and restart.  Ok, I do that and most of the time it fixes it but when these things happen again and again and again.  Spending 30 minutes doing that is not a solution.  They just need to make a better product.  Anyways, I‚Äôve seen plenty of people say ‚Äúoh I have no problems‚Äù. Ok good for you, and if you only have one echo dot, ya, you probably won‚Äôt see as many issues.  I‚Äôm just saying, I‚Äôve had 100‚Äôs and 100‚Äôs of tech devises and these (though they can do some neat things) are way too problematic to be satisfied with.  If I could do it over, I‚Äôd have gone with Google products for my smart home.	2	September 16, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Everything	3	August 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Good quality.	3	August 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Overall fun and useful. I've discovered a lot of new music with this. The sound quality is decent given the price and it's size. The one drawback is I'm bi-lingual, a lot of music I like is in Spanish and it has a hard time deciphering Spanish titles	3	June 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Has good sound though.	3	July 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I appreciate this product for my daughter, since she tends to ask a lot of questions of Alexa, but I don't like that I have to download extra items for something as simple as animal sounds. So if I ask Alexa what a chimp sounds like, I have to download an animal sounds ""app"" into the Alexa app to have it and then ask Alexa to use that animal app so I can ask what a chimp sounds like (an example of what I have to go through for my toddler daughter). Very foolish if you ask me. I don't like it. I just ask siri or Google and this usually collects dust."	3	April 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The idea is that you would ‚Äútalk to it,‚Äù when in reality you give it limited commands, which in practice take more effort that we would really want. They are moving in the right direction but have a long way to go. The sounds quality does exceed what one would think for such a small item and the overall confection of the item is fairly good. It is heavier than it looks and Thai reflects overall good materials. The buttons could be a bit sturdier, to be inline with the overall quality. Given that it is at such a low price point, the use of it as a stand alone speaker that easily interfaces with other devices, and that it does have some benefit in terms of its ‚Äúsmart‚Äù capabilities and I think it‚Äôs pretty descent. If they charged more then it would go into the rip off category. Watch videos on YouTube and see how it is used. Then try to see how much benefit you get out of it, under those specific scenarios.	3	December 8, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Handy for reminders	3	July 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have an Echo Show 5 & 8 and they both sound much better than the 3rd. Gen Dot. I'm not sure why , but the 3rd Gen Dot will have a very distorted sound when Alexa is talking and most times when someone with a is talking. I returned the first one I received thinking it was defective, yet the replacement does the same thing. My other Echo devices don't have that distortion and I tested to see if it was my wi-fi connection by putting the Dot right next to my router. No difference. I'm not sure if the 4th Gen has an improved speaker, but I'm going with that model next time if I decide to buy an another Echo Dot and only if it's on sale.	3	March 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I got it for a steal deal, but practically that didn't add anything to me. It's completely wired and needs a constant power supply, and voice recognition was so mediocre typically and worse while playing something, which makes us scream so much.

Echo Dot	Equally as convenient & helpful as it is frustrating & inaccurate. It makes life so much easier, but at least once a day I want to hit it with a hammer... also available on Amazon. Voice recognition is not great, & frequently gives incorrect answers to questions, but still, I can't imagine life without it.	3	June 2, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have three 1st generation Echo Dots.  I traded two of them with 3rd generation.  The look is much bigger than the first.THE GOOD:The sound for this is good for a small speaker standard.  Although I listen to music connecting it to a Bose Bluetooth, this sound is much better compared to previous generation.THE UGLY:1) ALEXA CAN‚ÄôT HEAR YOU!!!  I have one in my kitchen‚Äôs island, and one top of the bed with 12 inches from my head (from below) while laying down.  While the device hears the ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù call because she beeps and you see the light, she can‚Äôt recognize your commands.  If you say ‚ÄúAlexa what did you hear‚Äù she‚Äôll tell you she didn‚Äôt hear anything in the last minute.  The one in the bedroom is 12 inches from my head and it‚Äôs the same thing. The devices will NOT respond to ANY whisper even though she heard ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt know what they did to the microphones but I‚Äôm almost certain they downgraded them.2) THE VOLUME.  The 1st generation‚Äôs volume was quite pleasant.  You could even set it to 1% from the app.  My bedroom is quiet, so at night I like low volumes.  The 3rd generation can‚Äôt seem to be low.  I set the alarm multiple times and that seems to be an issue too.  This is frustrating late at night.Overall the only upgrade is for sound. Everything else is a downgrade from the 1st generation.  If you never had a previous generation, you‚Äôll enjoy it.	3	October 26, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"I bought this for my livingroom and it worked fine for a couple hours... but then it loses its connection. I have an Echo Show in another room and it is working great. The Echo Dot IS connected to the internet but is having trouble talking through my router/firewall. After it has been plugged in for a couple of hours it trys to connect to ip address 192.0.0.2 which is an address used by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for IPv4 to IPv6 translation. This connection fails and the ECHO Dot stops working. The only response I get from the Echo Dot is ""Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now. Please try again a little later."" The Echo Show in the other room works fine all the time through the same router/firewall. Rebooting the router/firewall and Echo Dot sometimes fixes the problem but not always. Sometimes I have to wait several hours and then reboot to make it work again. FYI... my router/firewall is pfSense."	3	December 17, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Well, I am happy that I kept myself up with the newest product I found very useful and practical and these smart speakers are just one of them. Unlike many others, I am using the echo environment in parallel with the Google assistant. The main reason of doing so comes from the compatibility issues and what these devices are programmed to cover. Yes, there are many similarities that you can get from both but if you are really into the smart assistant devices then you realize that the differences are remarkable and I wanted to have everything covered and connected so I am using both (Amazon echo and Google assistant). For obvious reasons, way bigger than what I can even encounter in here, Google is dominating the market when it comes to the speed and ease of use smart assistants and Alexa which is still quite better than Siri, Cortana and Bixby are still way far from Google on the second place. A great example of the differences here is like,when you are talking to an adult person vs you are talking to a kid! So with an adult you can speak freely and expect to get a response most likely than you are talking to a kid. I personally can't blame Amazon for what Google has been dominating solely for years and years ahead of everyone else so if you learned how to speak with this kid (Alexa in here), she is going to get the job done accurately and there's more, as I mentioned on the very beginning. It comes from the area of what one particular device covers and it's that important to get your attention to have the more compatible smart assistant for the tasks or other services you are planning to use. The bottom line here is the third generation of echo dot devices are the best of it's own kind and having them in parallel with Google assistant will do almost everything for what is doable in 2019 technology relm.	3	October 23, 2019	1
Echo Dot	bought this for my bathroom and I have youtube music subscription, but this speaker does not allow you to connect it. So I returned it since its not good for my needs.	3	June 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Overall not bad for free. Voice recognition is so-so at times I find my self walking towards the device till it picks up the simplest commands. Volume is OK but turn it up too loud and the speakers crackle a lot. Even though it's last Gen. still integrates with my other Alexa enabled smart devices nicely.	3	June 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It works...	3	July 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This review has been a LONG TIME COMING! Third generation echo is a piece of crap! It's cheap! It's unresponsive at times! It doesn't hear you very well or doesn't hear you at times at all! The second generation Echo was fast, always responsive, didn't take about half a second to a second to react (it was immediately), even the speaker power was stronger.I've had this piece of crap for 2 years and the 2nd generation for more than 5 years. They basically made a cheaper Alexa and implemented new cheaper features like less volume power when playing music and late response time as if there was a constant lag between you and the echo. I hate this piece of trash! The second generation is my favorite. I don't know how the 4th generation stacks up, but as I'm seeing more and more let's go cheaper, but sell it for more or the same price at Amazon. I'm not holding my breath for an even cheaper 3rd generation wanna be. Buy the second generation if you can or the speaker. DON'T BUY THIS THIRD GENERATION LET'S SAVE ON MONEY TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND SACRIFICE QUALITY FOR CORPORATE GREED, PIECE OF TRASH!!!Also, if you haven't noticed, why do you think they have this echo dot ALWAYS on sale or limited time price or they're giving it away with a 3 months subscription to whatever, keep the piece of trash and cancel the subscription anytime!? They are literally getting rid of it! WHY WOULD YOU WANT IT!?	1	August 31, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I would not recommend purchasing this if you‚Äôre looking to listen to music for an extended amount of time. I use this in my shop for music and it stops playing by itself. In an hour I would have to restart music. It will say, ‚ÄúSorry Alexa stop working because there was no recent activity.‚Äù What activity would someone have to do to listen to music? In an 8 hour shift I had to restart the music 7 times. SMH	2	September 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I've always been wary of this device.  Amazon really wanted me to own a 3rd gen one for .99c.  Great deal for a device that will record every conversation in the area.  It has its uses, but keep the thing on mute as much as possible.  This, unfortunately, makes the Echo less useful.  Maybe you don't need one.	3	May 20, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Working from home, I figured that an external speaker would improve the Zoom meeting experience compared to tinny laptop speakers, so I ordered an extra Echo Dot for $20 on Prime Day. The experience has been mixed. The Dot paired with my laptop easily and the sound quality was definitely better than the laptop speakers; however, despite the fact that the Dot sits right next to the laptop, the Bluetooth connection is not stable, occasionally disconnecting and reconnecting for no discernible reason (and loudly announcing itself when it reconnects during a meeting).  I thought an easy fix would be to connect the Dot to the headphone jack of the laptop using a 3.5mm cable, but discovered to my dismay that the 3.5mm jack on the back of the Dot is an output only, not an aux input.  In other words, you can use the Dot to play music on external speakers, but you cannot play audio from an external source on the Dot.  To get a jack which handles both output AND input, you need to buy one of the more expensive Echo devices (e.g., the $100 Echo Gen 4 or the $200 Echo Studio).  No thanks.  For the huge price difference, I will make do with the annoyance of the occasion Bluetooth connection problems.	3	July 25, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I strangely feel cheated because my echo broke a month after buying it without the warranty. It's bogus and I'm not buying another. After talking to the rep, I was satisfied this was resolved and I'm less mad, but please buy the damn warranty. You'll need it!	3	May 26, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"""Alexa, do something.""""Sorry, I don't understand.""""Alexa, please do what I asked.""""Okay, doing something completely different.""""Alexa, stop!"" ""Alexa, please please do what I asked.""""Okay, doing something else completely different.""""Alexa, stop!"" ""Ok google, do this for me.""""Ok, done.""That's about the usual interaction with Alexa. Its voice recognition is BAD, and only correctly understands probably about two-thirds of the time. The other third of the time, it's really bad. If you're lucky, it will decide to define random words or play some random song instead of turning lights off or making a new reminder.  This is for native English speakers who lived in North America for life, probably speaking closest to their basic training data as possible; I can't imagine how it would understand a non-native English speaker or with non-American accents.Do I recommend it? Well, I half recommend it. When it works, it's quite useful, and has pretty good integration, but that's only when it works. You really have to jump through structural hoops and do it in exactly the right structure when asking for things (always always put ""am"" or ""pm"" on you time when setting alarms or reminders, since it likes to set these for the middle of the night), which can be very awkward and unnatural.The design of the companion app keeps changing and still doesn't seem to have a UX expert assigned to it, so it's horrible to navigate through (Google Home app is even worse though, so there's that). I use the reminders feature extensively to help the kids keep track of when to join online school meetings, but I have to go into the app several times a week to fix or create reminders that the voice interface can't do properly.Good: nice access to music and Amazon services (at least with Prime), good integration with wide variety of smart home servicesBad: bad voice recognition and intention understanding, clunky and rigid interface to access some features (you have to phrase it just-right), poor knowledge lookup results (i.e., web search)Comparison to Google Home: I've been using both for years. Echo/Alexa and Google Home are similar on the outside, but have very different (and opposite) strengths and weaknesses. Echo/Alexa are strong on music, Amazon services, and smart-home integration, while Google Home is strong on voice recognition and knowledge search (Google recently killed their good music offering) and ok on Google service integration. When they're on sale they're cheap enough to get both and use them for different things.Bottom line: Alexa raises your blood pressure when you interact with it because Alexa often doesn't understand, in comparison Google Home nearly always understands and does better search but has inferior integrations. Alexa with Google-quality voice recognition would be great, but it's nowhere near that."	2	October 27, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Great gift, have not made it work to its fullest capacity	3	July 5, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Handy device, except when it's not, which is quite often.  Buy buying and using this not only am I subjected to ads (can't turn them off unless you cripple the device by making it ""kid friendly"", or putting it into a state my kids won't even use), but it also requires I shout at it sometimes (in a quiet room) just to get it to register the ""Ziggy"" alternative name they foist upon us.  All in all I would suggest waiting until you can buy devices that are more than convenient amazon shopping tools."	3	April 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is a great device if you want to control things without having to use your full attention and such. I can control whether my smart lights are on or off, what color they are, and the brightness, all from a quick voice command. I can stream my Spotify music to it and control volume and skips through voice commands as well. Timers and alarms are loud and useful. The only problems I have with this device, is the lack of useful skills, shotty voice recognition, and an awful app. The app is laggy, unstable, and sometimes doesn't save things you change. There is no really good skills to download for it either, limiting it's capabilities. I wish they had options for different voices, especially different personalities. I am tired of my Echo sounding like she's dead inside. At the end of the day, extremely worth the price and a good buy, especially for a home with smart devices.	3	November 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I bought this on black friday, because my 2nd gen dot was getting old and worn out.From what I can tell, they have expanded the frequency response to the detriment of clarity and quality. The bass is more noticable but not in a good way, the lower register of voice also sounds a lot more muffled.Oddly, this lack of clarity also seems to follow through to my bluetooth speaker, very noticable lack of sound quality when compared to the gen 2 dot on the same speaker. It sounds like one of those cheap boomboxes with the ""super bass"" turned on. And, no, there are no eq adjustments made, all are on-center.So, I've set this one aside for non-music purposes and reconnected my gen 2 dot for my music listening."	3	January 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Okay so I don't know if this is just mine, but this thing CANNOT hear me half the time no matter where I put it. Aside from that, when it does hear me, it often hears me incorrectly. I've done the things to teach it my way of speech etc etc. I find myself repeating things so many times and being misheard BADLY so much that I'm in a state of fury when I'm done. Lord knows what my neighbors must think always hearing the crazy lady arguing with her robot speaker. Yeah. So anyhow. That's a problem.	3	April 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"It sounds good, but here are the problems I'm facing it with it:Sound often brakes: Often times when the Echo connects to the computer, the sound crackles.  I have to unplug the device reconnect to fix the issue.Bluetooth Connection Notification: This very ANNOYING device constantly notifies you when it connects to a bluetooth device.  It could be connected to the computer for 10 minutes without use, but as soon as you play some sound, it has to loudly and blaringly notify you of its connection.  It's very annoying.Alexa:  Often times, Alexa responds to a statement/comment I made that did NOT involve Alexa.  I find myself having to argue with Alexa telling her, ""I didn't call you, Alexa - mind yo' business!""Not portable: This thing is not portable... why did I think it was portable?  Why did I think this thing had a built in battery? .... Uggh...Volume: You can sync the volume with your bluetooth device, but the echo notification will always sound at the volume it is independently set on, for example: if you have the volume on low from your computer, and you're listening to it low from the Echo (because it's synced), and you receive a notification sound, that sound is going to be heard at the volume the Echo is independently set on (which is usually on high).Alexa...raise the volume: And she raises the volume slightly... slightly...."	3	February 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	We have 11 Alexa units in our hous of various kinds. The whole house audio with multi room setup works for about 2 songs and turns off. Many of the devices don't stay connected.I will be going back to a mostly wired setup. These Alexa devices are not reliable enough. Every time I'm excited and trying to show someone, it fails.When 2 are in a stereo pair, it sounds significantly better than 1 and doesn't have many issues.It's the multi room audio that is bad.The Alexa app is always freezing and glitching too! Probably the worst part of this device is the app you need to control it. I haven't used Google home, but am thinking it might work better.We have all the Alexa devices. They all have the same connection loss and multi room audio issues.Very very dissatisfied with the app.You can't play music you like. Your almost forced to pay for Amazon music.There are so many work arounds to getting different things to play, but none are flawless.If I could start over, I would not go with Alexa devices because of the connection issues, and especially the app!	2	April 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I purchased this 3rd Gen Echo device to replace an echo ""flex"" dot that wouldn't maintain a consistent blue tooth connection to an awesome HK Onyx speaker I use. At first tried to use the headphone jack (on the 3rd Gen Dot) to connect the speaker (but it didn't work). It does however maintain the BT connection much better. However, when connected via blue-tooth it does not work well in an ""everywhere"" speaker group. I have 5 echo devices, and I link them for whole house music. I informed AMAZON, and they have passed it on to their tech group, but no joy yet. So I use this 3rd Gen dot as a stand alone dot in my kitchen, and when not BT connected it does work in my ""everywhere"" group. In the meantime the 2nd gen dot is Bluetooth connected to the Onyx speaker, and does work with ALL of the speaker/dots in my ""everywhere"" group.  So I got the result I wanted (eventually) but performance wise the 2nd generation dot works better than the 3rd gen dot. Sound quality wise, the 3rd gen dot is a much better speaker than the 2nd gen dot (when used as a stand alone unit)."	3	August 13, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I ordered two echo dot 3's when Amazon had their ""big sale"".  One set up to wi-if no problem and has worked great since. The second one, I had to try several times to connect, before I was successful. But it did not stay connected and all I could get out of it was a "" I'm having difficulties at this time, please try later"" response. At times it would just start talking without even being prompted.Then it might work for a week or so before it wouldn't do anything. I reached out to customer service via chat. That chat lasted over thirty  minutes only to be "" disconnected "" before problem resolved.  Again I reconnected going thru all the steps.  Week later it didn't stay connected, so I called and talked to a "" electronic specialist "".  That call was over half an hour long. I tried requesting a return shipping label, so I could send it back and get a new replacement since it was a faulty device. I was told that is not an option. I would have to send it back and they would fix it.  I responded that I bought a new item and want a new one as a replacement, not a ""FIXED ITEM ""  He finally agreed to send out a NEW echo dot and I would have to return the original.  A few days later, I received a ""REFURBISHED"" echo dot 3.  When I called to speak to a  supervisor, I was told that it is their policy to send refurbished ones if a new one is not in ""their stock"".  Doesn't matter they have new ones to sell on the website. I told him that I don't except that and it was not what I paid for. And if they are sending out refurbished echos, there must be a huge problem with them. He advised that they test them and to try it out.  So I opened the box.  All that was in the box was the echo dot. No power source .  Again 4th time reaching out to a Tech specialist- supervisor and 45 minutes of phone time. I was told that they only send device out when replacing. And they don't send out any accessories. When was a plug considered an accessory when it is needed to use device.  Again I told him that I bought a new device and it was faulty and I wanted a new device as a replacement.  Not one that has been fixed.  Also I found out that the 90 day warranty did not begin again when the replacement device gets registered. They back date it to the original sell date of first device.  So I only had 40 days left on the warranty.  Also if you go on line , a refurbished echo goes for $29.99, compared to the $ 49.00 , for a new one. Not once did any representative say that I would be refunded the $20.00 difference for the refurbished echo dot. I told him that this is an AMAZON echo dot. It has their name on the product and they should stand behind their name. I also said if I were to buy a tv from a store and took it home and it quit working, they would replace it with a new tv, not a refurbished one. I will never buy another electronic device that AMAZON sells with their name on it. I will tell all my friends and family that they will get screwed if something goes wrong with their product. So buyer beware.  Amazon does not stand behind their products and the consumer whom keeps their  business Alive."	1	September 10, 2019	0
Echo Dot	Some time works but not all the time	3	July 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I received mine today as part of the promo $.99 Echo Dot with Amazon music subscription. I thought great, here‚Äôs an affordable easily portable little speaker. I intended to use this as a Bluetooth speaker on camping trips and nothing else. First off, you can‚Äôt even pair your phone to the speaker without having the Alexa app. Second problem: you cannot pair your phone to the speaker if you do not have Wi-Fi. I do not have WiFi where I live. Third problem: the minute you unplug it from the power source it turns off - there is no power on and off button.I have no desire to use it for Alexa. I don‚Äôt use any of the assistant apps like Alexa - why? Well. Amazon records you. Don‚Äôt believe me? Look it up. I‚Äôve heard horror stories of Alexa recording private conversations and then somehow sending them out into the public. You can go online to view all of the recordings your device has on you. You can individually delete recordings as you choose but you cannot stop Amazon from recording you. It‚Äôs supposed to only record you when you use the word Alexa but somehow sometimes it records more even when you don‚Äôt want to.So. I will be sending mine back. It‚Äôs my fault for not reading more about the functions of this device and assuming I could trick it somehow to be used the way I want. I‚Äôm giving 3 stars just because I can‚Äôt say wether it works the way it‚Äôs intended to or not so I don‚Äôt want to leave just 1 Star but I also can‚Äôt give it 5.	3	June 15, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Sound crackles and is very hollow sounding.	3	June 30, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I used to love alexa, but now, they've turned her into that nagging child , tugging on your pant leg perpetually asking, 'are we there yet?'alexa wsa great when all she did, was what you asked her tonow she wants to tell you moooooooorrreee , and annoy the (#&( out of you in the processif you have one of the show varieties, you have a screen in settings that allow you to turn on and off whta kind of content will be displayed on your screen.  Thtas a nice feature, until, you find out thta they turn it ALL back on, when they do a push update.So instead of remembering your settings, like you would expect with a SMART device, it resets all those settings to on.  Which means , after each push update, you have to go around to all your show devices, and start scrolling and turning off all the options it turned back on.seriously?next comes, the by the way feature, which you cannot turn off.  again, seriously????you ask her something , or simply tell her to play music, and now and then you are rewarded with alexa rambling off at the mouth like an annoying child,  oh btw blah blahblahlbhaablabhjust shut the #**** ** already and do what I said.and you cant stop her from doing it.the voice recognition is generally pretty good, but after , what almost a decade, it still struggles with certain words and you sit there acting like a tourist in a foreign country slow speaking words trying to get it to understandalso, if its not connected to the internet, forget EVERYTHING.I have it tied to my philips hue light system.  Now considering these are smart devices,  connected to a home network, they should still be able to talk to each other on that network. but nope, it cant.  when my internet goes down, which it does from time to time,  everything stops.  I want to turn off the lights , forget it, alexa is having trouble communicating.  Well its connected to my home network still!!! i should be able to talk to the hue bridge and turn the lights off. but nope, it cant,  so rather than sleeping with a house full of lights on, I have to get up and go turn them all off.  This should not be a problem with a smart device in 2021.I used to love alexa, now, I hate it.  more directly I hate those in charge of seeing to it that alexa is not something that enriches our daily life, but annoys us to no end.	1	February 6, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"It has plenty of Loud but very little Soft and clear!  With just 10 or so volume level settings the adjustment from ""Alexia volume 1"" to ""Alexia volume 2"" is larger than desired.  I do like that I can say ""Alexia light off"" from bed, but nightly mood music volume control could clearly use some re-thinking.  The enhanced versions of this product with supposedly better sound quality are actually worse (louder not better).  I think the designers of this product think we are all deaf, or maybe they want to make us deaf..."	3	March 25, 2022	1
Echo Dot	The devise it‚Äôs ok for it to fully work as they promote in TV you have to buy extra services to make it fictional. For music display you have to buy an extra Amazon music package for it to give u all the music you want .	3	May 18, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This was a gift to my mother.  There was no adapter or cord in the box when she received it.  She had to purchase it separate.	3	June 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I got it thanks u	3	July 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	So, I got the two echo dot speakers after a friend gave me their larger echo speaker.  The setup was very easy and Alexa seamlessly integrated with my network, she seems to work well, and I was able to even integrate my Sonos speakers with the network, which is nice.  I now have music in every room in the house.  The problems are:1) There is no full functionality of third-party music services with Alexa.  Have Apple Music and Spotify and Pandora accounts...Apple Music is a paid service, too...but despite having Apple Music set as the default music service in Alexa, she continues to default to Amazon music.  She also refuses to shuffle playlists from any of the music services that allow you to build your own playlists (Spotify and Apple).  You set her to shuffle mode and it just continues to play the playlist in order...and she won‚Äôt load the whole playlist...she only plays about the first 15 songs on a loop.  So, while she works okay, there is still a lot missing with full functionality of third party music services.2) Playing music from the Echo speakers requires separate commands for each room, or she‚Äôll just play on all speakers.3) She won‚Äôt play the same music on both the Echo speakers and the Sonos speakers...while they are linked in that Alexa will control the Sonos speakers, she will not play the same music on all the speakers.  She requires separate commands for both Sonos and Echo speakers.So, while we are enjoying the benefits of having the speakers, and there are many, I really wish the developers would get to the bottom of these third party music service integration issues.	3	January 10, 2020	1
Echo Dot	The Echo Dot 3 is an attractive, compact device. It's a decent speaker with good, clear sound. Where it falls short is where you need it most. 1) Alexa's voice is WAY TOO LOUD! More often than not I find myself just unplugging at night to avoid the temptation to speak the wake word and have her blurt out at high volume like some drunk girl at a party that's already wound down. As it is dependent on wifi, any command while not connected will prompt a super loud reply, like say volume down while using the bluetooth function to stream shows or music. Same for when it connects to a device. She just yells out the device serial number. I've tried to find ways to quiet her voice level vs music and I just don't see the option anywhere. 2) For it to be a smart speaker that is compatible with smart devices it sure doesn't seem all that smart. It still needs to be manually connected to other devices that A) that are in the same network, B) have Alexa C) Have Alexa under the same account... D) Are streaming Amazon content. Feels like 2008 all over again. The Alexa app is ok but nowhere near as intuitive as it should be. 3) Echo Dot 3 is NOT a portable, speaker as it has no battery. Maybe they're saving that feature for the 4. I've never had a desktop speaker that I couldn't take with me. There are however 3rd party devices available to remedy this. Overall, like I said, decent sound device. As long as you have stable wifi and the patience to constantly adjust the volume and to the situation you should be fine with it.	3	December 31, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"Overall, I like this product. I have many Echos and have bought many more as gifts. I'm not going to talk about all her qualities because everyone else has that covered.Here's my problem. I use this one mainly as an alarm clock and sleep noise machine. Alexa used to work flawlessly for this, but she has become increasingly annoying with attempts to upgrade my services. The sound randomly shuts off in the middle of the night. So first problem is that I have to speak out loud, waking my husband, to get her going again. THEN to make matters so much worse, she launches into a sales pitch. Saying ""stop"" doesn't work. She just keep pitching that upgrade. Sometimes she promises to only make that offer to you one more time, but she lies like a cheap rug. So, in the middle of the night, there I am arguing with Alexa. by the time she starts making ocean sounds again, I'm angry and can't get back to sleep. I guess I'll have to buy an actual sound machine and have two things on my nightstand instead of one. UGH!"	3	August 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†I use my Echo Dot 3rd Gen for reminders and forecasts, and occasionally a song, but I otherwise don't expect much from it.In November 2021 an update was pushed into this device, and suddenly it started losing its connection to my WiFi and de-registering itself from my Alexa App. I've tried working with Amazon CS twice, and both times went through the factory reset process, but the device immediately stops working again.The issue seems to be that it just won't hold a connection and is stuck trying to update. If I factory reset the device it works, but then I will ask it something like ""remind me in 30 minutes to eat"" and it will say ""reminders are currently not supported on this device"". If I ask it again it will repeat this, but then after a few tries it will say ""okay, I'll remind you in 30 minutes"". The last reply used to be the only reply it gave when it was still working, but these forced updates broke my Echo Dot and now it doesn't work.The other problem is that if I unplug it or the power goes out, and then power is restored instead of just reconnecting to my network like it used to it gives me this rotating orange light and won't respond at all. If I push the action button it says ‚ÄúUpdating your device. I‚Äôll let you know when it‚Äôs ready.‚ÄùFactory resetting is the only way to fix this, but then the same problems I described start happening again; ‚Äúreminders not supported‚Äù, and then ‚Äúupdating your device‚Äù.This started around the time the update was pushed to this device. The fact that it‚Äôs not working is a consequence of something from Amazon‚Äôs end and not my end. If this cannot be fixed I would like the device exchanged for a working Echo Dot.Amazon literally broke this device's functionality. Until this recent issue My Echo worked well enough for the small number of tasks I used it for. I will try reaching out to them again to see if they are willing to replace what they broke through their OTA updating policy (which their CS told me they cannot roll back despite the problems it has caused). I hope they will be willing to do this, and be more careful about what they are doing with these device updates in the future.When it works it's nifty, but Amazon can make it stop working, and that is a serious design flaw."	1	November 18, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I find google nest has better integration with Youtube Music. Also Google Assistant outshines Alexa with more functions, better comprehension, and better search results. Voice pickup is not great. Either get more recent generations or go with Google.	2	October 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Music sound is acceptable. Female voice is very muffled.  Male voice much better but not great.Purchased this as a second unit to use at the back end of the house so that the wife and I would be able to hear reminders and timers in either end of the house without worries. It would seem Alexa would be able to ""talk"" to all of the echo devices at the same time. I can understand not being able to stream music to more than one device without paying for it but the Echo devices should be able to do the simple tasks and announce on all the Echos at the same time.Sound quality and lack of simultaneous announces is why I give it only 3 stars."	3	January 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It doesn't work with the smart socket I bought with it.	3	June 21, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"From a quality perspective, you cannot beat the sound and the manufacturing quality.  From a technology perspective, I think the technology is cool, but I remain concerned on privacy issues.  What is ""Alexa"" listening to in lurk mode?  How do I know what ""Alexa"" is recording or not recording?  I remain frustrated that around the 90 minute mark when listening to Pandora thru the Dot, the music shuts off arbitrarily.  I am not a big fan of only having two different voices for ""Alexa.""For these reasons and more, I don't know!"	3	March 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This is my second Echo. I have an earlier generation of the  Echo Dots, so this is a comparison to that one. The sound of music is much better. However, the microphone seems worse. It will hear its call sign,  but then it only waits about 0.0005 seconds for a command before it stops listening.  It's like the chime  that it heard me is also the buzzer that my time to speak is done.  I frequently have to give one word commands to activate and command it (Alexaweather, Alexaturnoffalarm) even with the adaptive listening function turned on.  It drags the total review down because I'm changing the way I interact with a device that is typically very intuitive.	3	January 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I've used my Google Home speaker for a couple of years and decided to get an Amazon Dot for another room. It was easier to set-up than than the Google one, but the sound quality was not as clear. For the most part, it is very responsive and gives good information. However, it provides the wrong location for weather when I ask for my schedule. I've gone through every setting possible to fix it, reset, reconnected, uninstalled, reinstalled, but it remains wrong. I've scoured the internet and found this to be a common problem with others, even trying every hint for correction that a few others used. This is very disappointing and makes it about 60% useful to me as compared to its rival product.	3	January 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"OCTOBER 2021 Update: I've unplugged her a few times, this time maybe indefinitely. Always confused, constant wrong answers, hardly understanding what exactly your question is... Or your commands... Quite frankly, I'm very annoyed with Alexa and unplugged her and about to trash her. Google on my phone is far far more successful... So annoyed lately.So, I wish I could give this a higher review. Here's the problem & after research on the internet many many more people also have this same issue. The volume. Every day the volume lowers itself to an almost inaudible level. You constantly have to tell Alexa to ""turn the volume up"" Sometimes more than once a day, because yes it will Sometimes lower itself whenever it chooses. Also, when you ask her to turn her volume up, like tonight, it turned my TV volume up... 3 times I asked until I got annoyed & had to manually do it on the App... Almost made me want to give it a 1 star. I was trying to Google, since Google seems to most always know what your asking & give the right answer as opposed to Alexa, but anyways I tried to Google a solution. As far as I've found, there is no solution, nothing in the settings to fix the volume issue so your stuck with that annoying issue every single day. Not to mentions Alexa doesn't always get your commands correct, will often confuse questions with commands & vice versa, & often has a difficult time giving you the right answer or Sometimes an off the wall answer to a question you didn't even ask. It's like having another girlfriend, but one that at least doesn't argue back...lol üòÜ Just annoys you...lol. jk jk... Anyways, half the time it sucks & the other half the time I lovs it. I enjoy the sound quality, the option to control devices when it works correctly, & it's many other functions that work a little more than 50% of the time... Amazon... Please make it a little better. The sound control issue, that shouldn't even be an issue in the first place... Thank you. Hope some of you found this useful. Alexa is still, for the most part, worth the buy... But half wondering how Echo Dot is...."	2	March 3, 2021	0

Echo Dot	Got this to replace a 1st Gen dot and while the standalone sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity are significantly better, it is frustrating. My family often gets impatient with this unit because it frequently has multi-second delay after you say the wake word‚Äìand about a third of the time, it takes 3+ tries to get it to wake.Another minor annoyance: it has its own special power cord. The previous version used USB and you could plug it into a hub or multi-port 120V charger. Now you have to use a dedicated 120V plug‚Äìmaybe it's Amazon's way of selling more power strips??	3	February 10, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"I bought a couple for myself when they are on sale for Black Friday. They are kind of cool little tools and I'm honestly not worried that they are ""spying"" on me. I mainly bought them to conveniently play music but I have had some issues with the voice recognition. Regardless of the music service I am using I have this problem, and it seems to be an Alexa voice recognition issue. I believe I speak pretty clearly, and in standard American English, but I can say something like ""Alexa, play the album 'Ruiner' by Alex Noble"" and it will NEVER understand me, no matter how hard I try. It always wants to play something with the word ""Rumor"" in the songname by a random arist, rather than looking through the catalog of the artist I mentioned and finding the closet song, which might be a good way to approach this problem in my opinion. Anyway, this was just an example and it has happened when I have tried to play many different songs and albums.Another issue is the Spotify integration. I was having issues with it and eventually completely de-synced Spotify from all my Alexa devices. According the the app, Spotify is not associated with any of my devices, but for some reason it will still play some content from Spotify. I don't get it at all and if it is user error, it is due to something that was poorly designed, because I'm reasonably smart and can't figure out the error.I'm glad I got the things, and hope this will be improved in time, since all it's knowledge and programming is ""in the cloud."""	3	January 14, 2020	1
Echo Dot	This device was very useful and entertaining. We connected our smart lights, and home thermostat to it so it was convenience to be able to turn on our lights hand free. Voice recognition is not always on point. HOWEVER, we have it for a year now and it seems like Alexa is getting worst. We have to repeat ourselves several times for her to recognize a command. Only a year old!!! Not sure if Bezo had anything to do with her sudden and quick decline. I wouldn't be surprised if he had his team programmed their products to stop functioning after a certain amount of time.	3	January 31, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Had a horrible time trying to connect with my wifi. Was told by an Amazon specialist I had 32 devices connected to my wifi & insisted I purchase a firewall for 99.00.

Echo Dot	So I got this with a tv I purchased and was super excited because I‚Äôve been wanting an echo and needed one for the smart bulb and plug I had purchased via Amazon. Setup is very simple once app is downloaded. The issue for me is keeping the device connected. It took about a day for the device to stay connected and even then I‚Äôve had for a week at this point it is still disconnecting. Other than that I love it. It‚Äôs loud, it connected to my smart bulb fine (but that disconnects too once Echo disconnects). I‚Äôm hoping it gets better. I chose this over Google (which my son has and never had issues with).	3	December 30, 2021	1
Echo Dot	For the most part Alexa is a superior external speaker for my tablets. It does play the music I enjoy.  Its good for updates on weather and national news. Alexa doesnt do well with requests for local news  I have to ask  multiple times to get it to read an audio book and its slow to learn my speach patterns and the time allowed to ask questions  is too short.as this was a gift I am inclined to overlook much of the inconvenience . I am  however getting frustrated with many of the claims for what it can do and it doesn't.	3	January 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"After 1.5 years of use, the best way to describe my experience with echo products is ""annoying"".I own 8 echo dots, a Fire TV, an echo plus, 2 echo studios, and an echo sub that I have placed throughout the house, to use as distributed speakers for playing music. Alexa controls allow for speaker pairs, home theater, room groups and multi-room groups, so everything would be great, right?!Well, except for the fact that the devices lose proper connection to the network for these complex setups - if you want to get it working again, you just have to go through the reset process. Except I bought in, and trying to reset all these devices every week or every few days is an abominable, endless chore.So I tell my speakers to play a podcast from the bedroom group, and the device acknowledges, and nothing happens. So I ask to play from the home theater group, acknowledgment, and nothing.I've tried upgrading the router, bought a second router to act as a repeater, and it's just not getting results. Believe me when I tell you that I've spent nearly as much time talking to Amazon support as I have my own family this past year.I would note that Amazon support has been very helpful through the app, but the app itself is abysmal, slow, and riddled with bugs that constantly tell me new echo devices have been discovered on my network.If this stuff worked, it would be amazing. But it doesn't. 1/3rd of the time, things are fine. 1/3 of the time, I'm listening to music and small weird glitches cause sound artifacts and small delays that make the songs choppy. The other 1/3rd, the devices just don't play music when or where I tell them to.At this point I can't even feel okay with selling these off to some sucker. I just want them to play music when and where they're asked, and play audio from my TV. Will they ever work? Only time will tell."	2	May 1, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"Setup was a breeze.  Got it online, started to link some of my home automation accounts...etc.  A couple of issues I have had was the ""EVERYWHERE Speaker.""  According to details, you can link all or specific echos in x-room so they all play music. So in essence, you can walk through your home and everyroom that has an echo, will be playing the music you had launched from room 1.  After looking through documents etc, I still can't figure it out.  Previous posts have said this is a bug in the software.  My echo gen1 worked fine.Second thing I've noticed, I have FireTVs linked.  I can't control them via voice. Prime example is - Alexa, turn off Diningroom TV.  Response:  Did you mean Livingroom TV?  Again -- not sure what the issue is:  I can control the same tv via wifi, with my phone.Little things like this have been irratating.  Apparently my google-foo is failing as well.  I'm not able to find info on the topic, but it would be great if this was a bug, if it was actually fixed.  OR if there is a FAQ or knowledge article on it, it would be awesome if the online help would help."	2	January 11, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I was given/bought this as a gift and even though I set it up with my Amazon account it is still paired with the account that ordered it as a gift for me so I get notifications from both accounts.Also when I paired the device with my Amazon five TV it only used the echo dot speaker and not the TV or auxiliary speakers which drastically reduced the sound so I had to disconnect the echo dot from the fire tv.It is basically a glorified light switch (when you buy the plugs that pair with it)  and a weathered and news station.	3	January 16, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Over a period of several months, I attempted to set up this item but it would not connect to the internet. I have two other Echo devices that are connected with no problem.  The return policy button on my invoice states it can be replaced through April 2023.  I tried to replace it but was directed to chat with an Amazon representative.  I spent almost 2 hours with a half a dozen different people in chat and no one could get it set up and they refused to replace it.  I sent them a screenshot that stated it could be replaced through April 2023 but they said it only applies to unopened items with the replacement for open items being 90 days and not a year.  Of course the return policy button doesn‚Äôt state that.  They also said they couldn‚Äôt replace it because it wasn‚Äôt registered.  I explained that it needed to be connected to Wi-Fi to register and since it won‚Äôt connect, can‚Äôt register.  They said I could trade it in and get a refund of the current value, but a $5 refund on a $30 item didn‚Äôt appeal to me.  With all of the purchases I make on Amazon, it seems like a bad business practice to harass me so much on a $30 item.  Guess I am just out my $30.	1	August 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Sometimes Alexa forgets to wake me when she was programed to do so	3	June 5, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Great little smart device with a woman name Alexa inside a machine. I was watching someone's video in the comments here showing the smart light function demonstration (alexa turn on the light) and even my echo dot sitting at the corner in my room woke up to pick up what that person said in the video and told me ""Sorry I didn't find a device name light"". The only problem I ran into was drop in call sometimes doesn't work. Some restarting may resolve this bug but I hope it's not repetitive. I ain't not time to unplug my echo dot every time this happens. Sometimes when music is playing at 3/4 volume, Alexa won't hear me unless I yell at the top of my lung for it to wake. Overall it's an impressive small smart device. I can't wait to try out the smart plug and dimmable color bulb. We just need more Alexa controlled smart device like ""Alexa, flush the toilet"" without having to press down that filthy flush lever or ""Alexa, open the window blinds in the kitchen"" operating the blinds with a motorized device installed at the main headrail. I can go on but that's just giving free ideas to Amazon. I just love being creative. That's what I do, I drink and I know things.Update 10/31/19: There is a loud high pitch squeal  noise coming out of the echo dot when I drop in call from my Alexa app thru my android phone. Making it unbearable to communicate with someone with they drop in call me. Its horrible! 1 star taken away til they somehow fix this or I will just return it."	3	October 31, 2019	1
Echo Dot	I have been fighting with this little piece of crap to try and get it to do what I tell it. It won't acknowledged me unless I tell ALEXA!!! and then scream commands at it, which it usually ignores. One night I was hollering at alexa trying to get it to turn off my fan and turn on the bathroom light. It wouldn't acknowledge me so I kept having to yell and yell. my neighbor called the cops because she thought there was a domestic dispute. I had to demonstrate to the officers. Of course alexa listened and obeyed immediately. I had to let them search my property to convince them I lived alone. I was MORTIFIED. I don't know why I keep this little brat around.	2	July 5, 2022	0

Echo Dot	"Using an Android Samsung Galaxy 7 Prime I could not set-up an Echo Dot 3 with the Amazon App after previously setting up both an Echo Dot 3 and Smart Plug a few minutes prior. I called Amazon support and they could not fix the problem so advised they would send out a different unit and to return the old unit. I promptly receive the new Echo Dot 3 and had the same problem. I then downloaded the Amazon app to my iPhone and it worked - Set-up complete. I then tried it on the other Echo Dot 3 and after two tries using the app on the iPhone set-up was complete.I will keep the unit and ""not return"" it to Amazon. I have not seen another medium to advise Amazon of this other than this.I just thought it was strange that the app work better on the iPhone versus the Android Samsung phone. Still having a problem downloading Contacts to the Echo device so I can make voice calls by name.Bottom line is that I like the product but did not like the problems with the set-up process and difficulty in downloading Contacts so I can use the Echo as a speakerphone. The app also froze several times forcing be to reboot the phone and this was common on my IOS and Android phones. For these reasons and all the time spent working on fixes and researching the How-To for the device, I can only give this product three stars. This is suppose to make life easier, not take hours to set-up. Still working on some issue like Contacts."	3	November 27, 2019	1
Echo Dot	This is an inexpensive version of the Alexa.  It will answer a lot of questions but lacks certain sophistication functions.  We did ask Alexa to change her voice to male and we hard-of-hearing seniors can hear him better.  We are learning how to ask questions.  Alexa does not always have all the answers and likes to advertise some pay-for music program.  It finds most of the songs we ask for.  Nice for temperature, rainfall, forecast...	3	March 6, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"Good for 25... not 40! Sometimes it doesn't hear me and other times it activates when not spoken to. Sound quality is ""ok"" not fabulous. I need a couple more but not for 40 each.... I'm waiting for some sort of promotion. Amazon thinks way too highly of these devices and you can see that in the pricing."	3	April 19, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Sound quality muffled, like talking thru a sock.  Alexa learned my voice but heard a command from a YouTube I was watching and responded to it (the guy had a higher voice and accent.. That's not me). It also takes time for a response, more than Google. Also, I couldn't get it to shut up.  Alexa tried to sign me up for Amazon music unlimited several times, I had to unplug. Very frustrating.Update: the response gets better as you use it. Still can't do multiple questions like Google Nest. I did use the drop in feature after which I accidentally called myself now I have received 20 calls in 8hrs from numbers similar to mine with VM from ""Amazon"" saying someone has accessed my account.  These are spoof calls. Completely annoying.If you are an ""Alexa"" type Echo would be a fit but get the 4rth Gen.  If you like more informative information, or a Google person... It's not for you.An example. I asked both Alexa and Google Assistant ""What's the heat index in Boston""ALEXA: *definition of Heat Index.GA: ""The Heat Index in Boston is 103 degrees Fahrenheit."""	3	June 22, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I'm not sure if this is Pandora's fault, or Amazon's fault, but integration with Pandora is very poor. We mainly use this as a smart music device that also tells time and weather. Everything worked well when we had Amazon's unlimited echo streaming plan, and it normally picked the correct music, but canceled when we got a newer echo (this one) and someone in our household signed up for Pandora with family sharing. Since then, the experience has been mostly poor. Alexa rarely matches against the correct music (that I know exists on Pandora), and quite often plays offensive music, which is not good when it's mostly for my kids. For example, if you ask Alexa to play the Frozen II soundtrack (for the kids), it plays some random trash. Worse, I asked Alexa to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"" for my daughter, and it keeps trying to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snow Dick"".  This last part likely isn't AMZ's fault, but Pandora doesn't have a cast to Alexa option anymore, so there's no way to get at the music that you actually want it to play without using the Echo as a bluetooth speaker... less than ideal... Alexa should just work regardless of service.I'm a big music fan, so I have hundreds of my albums uploaded to Google Music (Amazon's music locker service is long gone)... but unfortunately those are not available on my echo, because Amazon doesn't allow Google Music on their devices. Maybe they will add this one day, as they did with YouTube TV on the Fire devices."	3	December 28, 2019	1
Echo Dot	The device itself works as intended. I use it mostly as a speaker for my music and its great. What irritates me is if I gotta change the WiFi, it will stay stuck on setup mode and I‚Äôve done everything everybody recommends to reassure the device can connect.	2	September 17, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I'm going with 2 stars because when it is working, the dot is super convenient. I love being able to just ask what the weather is going to be that day or ask how long it's going to take me to get somewhere. However, every single echo dot that I have owned has stopped being able to ""hear"" me, or just has stopped responding to my questions after about a year and a half. I don't know if it's the fact that it stays plugged in all the time, or if it's just not meant to last for more than a year or so? It's just very frustrating and disappointing. I shouldn't have to replace something every year or two. I rely on my echo dot as an alarm clock so when my alarm goes off earlier than my husband has to get up and for whatever reason all of the sudden Alexa can't hear me anymore, it just keeps going and going and going and I have to get up to unplug the entire dot to get out to stop. I am very frustrated by this and will be switching to Google home in hopes that it does not have the same issues."	2	January 31, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"This was my second Echo Dot so ,obviously I like them, but when I went to set it up I had issues it wouldn't connect to the internet. After going to the Amazon troubleshooting site, and trying everything there. I decided to use the pop up virtual assistant. I was then connected to a ""tech"" by phone which they asked for my number. After being reassured he would fix the issue and have it running by the time the call ended, he remoted into my computer, said I had all these issues installed a network security program which ""protected the network and everything on it"" he asked for $500.00. when I told him I didn't have the money he hung up on me. I got suspicious and deleted the program he installed, scanned my system with my security and did the cleanups I know about. Two days later I got 8 calls about fraudulent charges on my amazon account. I really got nervous because I never gave him any of my account numbers at all. So I called Amazon to inquire about the charges they reassured me my account was fine, I explained what happened and they said they would never ask to remote into someones computer and I needed to change all my passwords. They logged the numbers I got calls from and said they would look into this. I then called my internet service to change the password and was told I should bring my computer into an IT person just in case something was installed I didn't know about. I just got my computer back and they did fine suspicious programs on my system. so much for a great Prime day deal of 20 it ended up costing me $150.:( And I still couldn't get the dot to connect, finally I had to use my phone, which I don't like doing. The Alexa app for PC id useless."	2	July 6, 2021	0

Echo Dot	I have a Gen 2 Alexa and have really enjoyed it.  When the Gen 3's went on sail about a month ago I ordered one and got a free light bulb to boot.It took over a month for the the Gen 3 to arrive (the bulb came in a few days).  I am not sure why it took so long.I set it up and was VERY disappointed in the sound. I am not a sound techy person and didn't have a problem with the sound of the Gen 2.  Yes it is a little tinny and music has almost no bass so I was expecting an improvement in the Gen 3.  Not only is there no improvement but it is actually worse.  It sounds like it is stuffed in a sock or something.  The sound is very muffled.  I went to the EQ and took out all of the bass, almost all of the midrange and pushed treble as high as it would go.  It is some better but still not right.  I can not imagine why they would have killed the sound this way. If they weren't going to improve it they could have left it alone.  With the new look they still could have sold it as a new version.	3	December 22, 2020	1

Echo Dot	There are many things I love about having an Alexa.  If my family is only listening to music on one device it's totally fine, but I wanted something that I could have one song in one room and another on in another room.

Echo Dot	"Numerous small issues.When you set a timer, it's local to that device. So if you set a timer in the kitchen for, say, cookies or something, then go to another room, that timer will only go off in the kitchen even if you have an echo dot by your computer.The app is annoying; it needs a ""duplicate routine"" option for if you need to make multiple similar routines. For example, if you make a routine for ""I'm in the den"" which turns off all the lights except the ones in the den, and then you want to make an ""I'm in the living room,"" you can't just copy and edit the first one. You have to set it up from scratch, which in my apartment means setting six individual lights to off and one on. Each of those is selected from a menu, then you set options in sub menus, so something that should take less then a minute ends up taking up to ten. Plus if you accidentally hit ""back"" it drops all progress and starts over. And there's no option to create routines on PC in a browser where it would be more convenient.The echo dot often doesn't understand what I say. Sometimes I have to repeat commands up to three times.Alexa never shuffles playlists when I ask her to play music, which is only a minor annoyance but it's still annoying.There's a ton of potential for this to be awesome in the next generation, but for now it's just okay. The device itself would get another star if the app was better."	3	October 9, 2019	1

Echo Dot	Not as smart as you would like it to be for sure. What I like the most about smart devices is that they save you time and make things better with easier steps. This wasn't the case here. I got 2 dots and thought to myself I will make a smart surrounding sounds system. It failed miserably. First the Routines on the Alexa app sucks especially when you have more than 1 device. When it connects to your phone, only one device can play the sound for some reason. The 2 devices works only on Amazon music, which I thought is fine, I'm not opposing it but then the app is so laggy. The devices can't follow complex demands. And it can't even save your answer for a question they ask me every day. This is a big fail for me. The sound quality is alright though.	2	May 13, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I give this device 1 star because it doesn't respect settings set via the Alexa app. Specifically, I use Spotify. When I ask Alexa to play a playlist using this device, it never finds it because it insists on using Amazon Music. I've selected Spotify as the default music service through the Alexa app (note: can't do this on web!), and it still refuses to understand. The end result is any time I ask it to play a playlist on Spotify, it can't because it's looking on Amazon Music - or worse, it plays some random song from Amazon Music that I don't want. It's incredibly frustrating and, consequently, I wouldn't recommend it.The audio quality is pretty good though. It can also get loud. It's just a shame that a device I want to use for playing music can't play music because Amazon can't figure out that I want to use a service other than Amazon Music.	1	October 3, 2022	0

Echo Dot	The product had amazing sound but would not play more then a few songs and shut off.  I have an Echo Dot 2 and they would not connect.  I can ask my echo dot 2 to play the rolling stones and it will literally play for days.  I would ask the echo dot 3 and it was a crap shoot.  I have the echo dots to play  music 24 hours a day.  I have 2 little dogs and I have found if I play music all the time they are more calm as the outside noises of apartment living are kept at a minimum.  The echo dot would not perform in that manner.  I tried to connect the two of them and it looked good on the ipad but they never connected to play the same music thru out the apt.  I would come home and the echo 3 would be off and I would have a panicked dog.  Not cool.  Amazon Sent me a new echo dot 3 and it lasted for maybe 2 months... the speakers sounded blown.  Amazon sent me a return label...  Since I love my echo dot 2 I have ordered an echo show 5 and I am praying I love it!!  I have had more good luck with amazon products then bad so I am willing to continue using their products.  They did refund me for the echo dot 3!  Thank You Amazon for standing behind your products!!	3	December 16, 2019	1
Echo Dot	My Echo Dot was a kind gift replacement for a bedside radio alarm, including some lists and reminders provided by the giver.  My house appliances are not electronically automated (I still know how to turn switches on and off), I don't use other voice activated aids nor do I remember command key words readily (so if I say the wrong key word, Alexa has no idea what I want, leaving me to scratch my muddled brain about appropriate synonyms), and I feel it's kind of creepy talking to a dumb computer voice which hasn't been adequately programed to search for my music or queries. Nor is the cell phone app very helpful for finding how to use features which I haven't yet realized that I might not need. Nor is the Amazon Prime Music library very complete, for the kind of classical and jazz music that I like without paying another monthly fee (Pandora - if I could attach to it -  provides a much broader Station association between my song and others I might thumbs up). But it is nice to be reminded to take my nighttime pills or to have Dot tune in to my favorite on-line radio station when I say 'Alexa, Good Morning,' with great sound quality, as long as she hasn't changed the volume to blast me out of the room since the last time.	3	August 7, 2020	1
Echo Dot	My 9 year old received this as a gift. After setting up free time and subscribing to kindle unlimited we set it up using his preexisting kindle profile. Alexa works with specific commands which doesn‚Äôt seem like a problem at the time but when she only recognizes your voice 25% of the time it‚Äôs a bit of a pain. All 3 members of my household have different accents coast to coast and no luck with echo dot. On top of that she doesn‚Äôt recognize the names of a lot of the 3rd party apps for kids. Setting the up routines was a long glitchy process and the math app was not great. Overall it does preform its basic functions which is why I gave it 2 stars. Nothing puts a parent in a great mood like yelling ‚ÄúRead Harry Potter!‚Äù 7 times and hearing ‚ÄúReading Peter Rabbit by Beatrice Potter.‚Äù Eventually even the most patient child begins to hate Peter Rabbit all because of Alexa.  After yelling the name of your book 5 times eventually she might get it and if not you can use the phone app.Pros: Can remind kids of chores and will play audiobooks if you open them from your phone.When we were picking out smart speakers for the rest of our home we decided to try Google Home Mini and wow what a difference. Google Home can recognize conversational commands, help kids with math problems, has exceptionally clearer sound in addition to both voice and touch volume controls. So far the only con is figuring out how to edit actions in the middle of the night without google responding verbally. Google will even tell you Alexa has her strengths and Google has hers when you ask who Alexa is. It‚Äôs not linked directly to audible but you can play it using the Bluetooth function. It also connects to our smart tv. The only advantage Echo Dot has is a direct connection to order on amazon or audible but given that Alexa opens the wrong book 75% of the time I can only imagine the problems with orders. Our kiddo is jealous and now wants a Google Home mini too.	2	May 26, 2020	0

Echo Dot	This speaker is ok, it‚Äôs not what I thought it was and maybe that‚Äôs my fault because I assumed instead of reading. The speakers volume is ok but if your having a party or something this is definitely not the speaker for that and the speaker has to be plugged up I thought it was Bluetooth and can just be charged but no. Which is surprising but it was only $20 so you get what you pay for. The price makes sense.	3	January 24, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I mostly use it for music and I get it, it‚Äôs Amazon not apple so it probably doesn‚Äôt completely support Apple Music but it says it does so I feel like it should. I‚Äôm not paying for two music streaming services, it‚Äôs so frustrating when I ask her to play my music and she‚Äôll say ‚Äúplaying elyssas music from Apple Music‚Äù and probably 10% of the music she plays is actually in my playlist. If I wanted to listen to random music I would select a genre. No I want to listen to songs I know the lyrics to and know I like. ‚ÄúYour feedback is saved‚Äù no it isn‚Äôt you play the same songs over and over no matter how many times I thumbs down. I lost it before I posted this because I told her ‚Äúskip‚Äù about ten times and every song she played wasn‚Äôt in my playlist and it was songs I knew and hated. I have like one Kendrick song so she‚Äôs always trying to play him even tho I have ONE song that he FEATURES In, it‚Äôs not even his song and she‚Äôs always playing him and I ALWAYS thumbs him down cos I don‚Äôt like his voice at all. I always lose my patience and just tell it to shut up cos I‚Äôm not in the mood to listen to music after saying skip/thumbs down 20 times in a row.	2	October 23, 2021	0
Echo Dot	I've enjoyed my Alexa and this, the Dot, since setting them up about 6 months ago.  They are pretty easy to set up, voice commands to play songs and adjust the volume work well most of the time, and the sound quality even on the Dot is pretty good.  Plus I can play songs directly from my Amazon Music library.  All good, right? Well, sort of...The thing I DON'T like is that if my wife is playing songs from Amazon Music on her phone or anywhere else, and I ask Alexa to play a song, I can't do it unless I want to pay the $14.99/month unlimited family plan streaming fee.  I understand that Amazon needs to make money, but I already pay $99 per year for Amazon Prime and I buy over half my stuff on Amazon.  Now they want 15 bucks a month just so my wife and I can both enjoy music at the same time?  This is an example of the big guy on the block wanting ALL the money.  I'm annoyed every time I can't play a song.  So If you're the only one streaming music on Alexa, or if you don't mind shelling out another $14.99 per month, then I would recommend Alexa and Alexa Dot.	3	October 10, 2020	1

Although I‚Äôm not a fan of Google, at least Google Home assistant is more intelligent and easier to use (yes, you can simply say ‚Äúall lights on‚Äù and Google will turn on everything even if it has ‚Äúlights‚Äù in name). It feels like an Amazon spy in your house. Wanna buy more toilet paper? Alexa will interrupt and tell you that. Sorry Amazon, I‚Äôm not interested. Even Bluetooth sucks, because there is no way to lower Alexa‚Äôs voice and increase bluetooth volume (and yes I increased volume on my phone). Point for mute button.	1	October 14, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"We bought this to replace our Google mini that died due to a widespread glitch in a Google update. Our Alexa Dot seems sturdier than the mini- hopefully it will last longer? That said, it's much harder to use. It was a real pain to set up ( how we'll ever remotely be able to direct nursing home staff to set up Mom's replacement for her Google mini, I have no idea! She relied on her mini to wake her up, tell her weather and answer a myriad of questions she has). The dot is more finicky about asking for stuff in exact words- getting it to open my favorite radio station takes some tongue-twisting. It requires a lot of ""skills"" to be downloaded from the app ( like a separate skill for each separate radio station or background sound you want) in order to more easily recognize your request- each skill an app that you have to search out and download. Also, Alexa's sense of humor is TERRIBLE! ( we loved asking funny stuff of our Google mini. Maybe this will get better as Alexa ""gets to know us""?) The responses have been beyond flat with the Dot. Hopefully a lot of this is just a slow learning curve, but we shall see. Definitely not as intuitive as the Google mini, that's for sure!"	3	September 2, 2020	1
Echo Dot	If all you would use this for is to ask for information which is only for spoken Alexa then it‚Äôs perfect but for music I think it‚Äôs poor quality got this free from Bestbuy with TV purchase. Took me a whole year to take it out the box and set it up, overall it‚Äôs okay nothing major for good quality music poor bass.	2	August 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Ok, Would be nice to have a clock like the higher priced ones. Still don‚Äôt know if to trust any of these listening devices.	3	May 10, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Glad it was free with a Sirius xm renewal. Easy to set up and it is convenient to use but it will not after 3 hrs on phone with product support recognize or control Philip's hue lamps. Turns out this had to do with the broadcast frequency of my wifi and what frequency the hue and the echo will work on. Been so long now I forget the exact details but it is unacceptable that Alexa tech support could not figure this out. I sent the hues back. Got alexa plugs and while hard to set up and get them all in the same group, they work well.  After living with Alexa for a few years now, my opinion is that it is needlessly complicated because of trying to be everything to everyone. Too many ways to do the same thing when just one way would be fine. And why would anyone want the thing chiming or glowing in the middle of the night because the status of an amazon order changed and it does the same thing if you set a routine. Totally aggrevating and totally unnecessary.  The best thing I have found that this thing is good for is along with the plug modules, I can turn on a light in every room of my house with a single voice command from my bedroom.  This is why I bought it and the plugs. Other than that, I could do without it.	3	February 3, 2020	1
Echo Dot	UPDATE:So it would seem that echo dot is less user friendly than my initial impression.- If you are 5ft+ away from it, or if there is any other sounds in the room, or if there is any obstacle between you and the dot, it starts to not hear you or misidentify your command even when you already raised your voice. The further away you are the worse this gets.- I cannot get it to stop blinking yellow notification. I've read multiple sites on how people turn off notification for tip of day, mail, etc. but it still blinks and gives me that tip of day crap. It should've be a very simple configuration and it should work the way I want it, not having me looking up sites after sites for configuration for a simple option maybe just because amazon wants to showcase their featureBecause my sole purpose of getting it is just to give me accurate voice command capability of lights/electronics around the house and not give me unsolicited information. I'll say it around 2.5 star for me at this time.----------------------------------Overall setup is very simple for someone who is somewhat familiar with technologies and can follow instructions.The dot is smaller than I remembered but has surprisingly good sound quality for such small device. It is very nice looking imo and can recognize my command very well. It does sometimes have trouble picking up my voice about 10+ ft away in my fairly opened living room/kitchen/dining room area, I'll have to test this further as it was quite noisy in the room at the time.I also have non-amazon brand smart switches setup and the Alexa app was able to pick it up. I was very impressed because it asked me which room the light switch was at and setup the light switch all by itself without any manual intervention on my part.I got the three-dot deal and one of the box seem to have been opened previously because the seal sticker on the box has been teared off, however the inner plastic wrapping seems intact. As the dot seem to be functioning flawlessly and it seems too big a hassle to return it, I am just going to keep it but just throwing this out there for whoever might care - check your factory seal.I am actually in the process of recommending a smart home system to an elderly relative who would prefer foreign language voice command. I think this might be a feature where amazon falls short of but otherwise I am perfectly happy with this system.	2	November 30, 2019	0

Echo Dot	The Echo Dot refuses to answer incoming calls even though the cell phone is linked to the device..  I spent more than 70 minutes with Amazon device support and she was unable to fix the problem.  There should be a simple Let Alexa Answer Incoming Calls setting but instead, there are a half dozen related settings scattered around.  Regardless, even with all of them set properly it still does not detect the incoming call.  Asking Alexa to answer the call results in a no incoming calls reply.	3	December 26, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I had a google home and tried to change over to the echo dot. It's just not as smart or as capable as google home. Maybe if I got everything from Amazon it'd be different but I'm not switching my whole life over to that. So if you're 100% amazon integrated it could be good for you. Sound is decent though.	3	March 4, 2022	1

Echo Dot	One of my other ones, a year old, died so I ordered this one to replace it.  This one is definitely diff from my older version ones.  This one, in a room downstairs, would respond to my commands instead of the one a few feet away from me in the same room upstairs.  So I switched those two.  I commented on the difference and then I believe it made some adjustments because it asked me a few times after that if the correct echo dot responded.This one has a more bass tuned voice and I don't like it as well as the way my previous ones sound.  It is less clear. I think it is probably to give music a better sound if you use it to play through its builtin speaker but I don't.  I have BT speakers for music.  I haven't checked to see if you can alter the bass/treble.This one has a cloth wrap on it and a bit rounder shape, I don't really care about that, I thought the other ones were fine and probably would stay cleaner or at least be easier to clean since they are all hard plastic.  Not that I've actually cleaned any of them lol.  Anyhow it provides the same functionality for me and that is what I wanted.	3	June 1, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is fine for keeping track of what I need from the store, but a few months ago, the TuneIn feature became, to my deep dismay, ubiquitous. I bought several Alexas to listen to radio stations etc, but suddenly, commercials appeared on TuneIn and consistently interrupted my enjoyment. Especially the ads for services that aren‚Äôt relevant. And the ones that pop up during discussion programs. I‚Äôm thinking about ditching the Alexas and listening to music via other routes, and using them for shopping lists. Which to me is a huge disappointment and a waste of money	2	July 9, 2022	0

Echo Dot	I purchased three of these during Prime Days.  First, it took FOREVER for me to receive them, and I still have not received one of the three ordered.Secondly, the only music platform that seems to work correctly is Amazon music.  On any other platform, the song gets about a quarter of the way to halfway finished and it cuts out to dead air.  When the music resumes, a new song is playing.  I listen to pandora primarily, then apple music and Amazon as my last option.  I purchased them to add easily accessible music in my office, gym, and yoga room.  I contacted amazon and did troubleshooting with no resolution.  They sent me two replacements that are doing the same thing.  The funny thing is if I listen to my second-generation dots and plus I have no issues with any of my music platforms.  It is only the third-generation with the problem; which tells me there is something wrong with this third-generation.  I hope they will take this back and return my money.  I would rather have a refurbished second-generation than not to be able to listen to all of my music platforms.Thirdly, the echo says it is up to date, BUT the tech support representative stated that the software version is not the latest.Lastly, I have to repeat myself multiple times for this echo to wake up and do what is asked.  In my opinion, Amazon had to throw a bunch together to keep up with demand from Prime Days and manufactured a bunch of defective echo dots.I hardly ever do reviews, but I am so annoyed with this situation that I had to let others know what to expect.  This third-generation is not the high-quality Amazon product you have become accustomed.  Do yourself a favor and wait until a new generation becomes available or buy an old one.	1	August 27, 2019	0

Echo Dot	I like music in my environment.  When Google / YouTube went to subscription-only music, I retired my Google Home for Alexa and the Alexa Dot.  I am already paying for Prime, so I might as well enjoy the Amazon Music through Alexa.  I bought this Dot in September, so you know I've given it more than a shot at impressing me.The combination of Amazon Music and Dot/Alexa is inconsistent at best, frustrating at worst.  I can't tell you whether the problem is with Alexa/Dot or Amazon Music, but I usually have no problem with Amazon Music when I play it through my laptop.  The problems? Sometimes I have to ask Alexa twice to play a music station.  The first time she will confirm the station I've requested... then silence.  Nothing.  So I ask again.  And music...  Sometimes I ask to play a station and  the music starts, then stops after one song... or two songs... or ten minutes... or continues to play (my preferred action) until I tell it to stop.  Sometimes I think it's the act of 'asking', so I use my app.  The same inconsistencies.  And frequently an ad pops up on my app asking if I want to pay MORE for Amazon Music.  Really?  I'm auditioning your service everyday.  You're not winning my money.I'm not sure how I'm going to resolve this.  Pay for another music service? Go back to Google Home?  But I wanted to get my frustrations in front of people.  With 4.5 stars after over a million reviews, I think proclaiming my disappointed in this product will make little difference.  Amazon.  Are you listening?  Something is wrong with this.	2	February 24, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"I have mixed feelings about the Echo Dot.  I do like the convenience it has with just speaking a command to the Dot.  I also like the portability of just plugging it in anywhere, as long as you have wi-fi. .We use it for music 95% of the time.  On the down side ,it gets confused about certain playlists we try to activate.  About 50% of the time, it will stop  playing for no reason and when we ask why, we get ""stopped due to inactivity"".  Why do we need to be active with it, it's supposed to be playing music.  This seems to be a common issue with this device per the forums I have read.  As many posts that I have read on this, you would think that Amazon would have this issue resolved by now.  Some of the posts I read are dated over a year ago.  At the end of the day, I would have to say the Echo Dot is just an ""OK"" device.  The negatives take away from the positives.  I doubt I would ever purchase another one."	3	March 23, 2021	1

Echo Dot	This model is not worth getting. The sound quality is pretty good, and the things you can tell it to do is pretty comprehensive. The only problem is when playing music, she gets hard of hearing. It's like yelling at a teenager because it takes 3 or 4 yells for Alexa to respond :/	3	March 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Alexa doesn't speak Chinese for voice commands, even though Alexa / Echo Dot (Gen 3) can translate English into Chinese when asked, ""Alexa, what's ----- in Chinese?"". If you use this to listen to C-pop: Alexa absolutely CANNOT find songs, playlists, or artists in Chinese. For example, artist 'Shinyen' was pronounced (in English) ""Shuh-NYE-en"". That's 'NYE' as in 'hair-dye'. (rolling eyes emoji) Please add ‰∏≠Êñá (Chinese) as a dual-lanugage option paired with English for the United States. An even better advanced feature would be a Polyglot option with the ability to select one or more primary languages for those of us in a multi-language home. Also: Indigenous Lanugages PLEASE! All of America is traditionally Indigenous Land."	3	October 31, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This is a great little device for setting up reminders to get things done. It‚Äôs also a good back up alarm clock. I also use it for podcasts and music. The only shortcoming I see at the moment is that it will respond to anyone who calls its name.	3	March 15, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I bought two of these last Christmas since they were cheaper than the normal price, and I am trying hard not to get rid of them. When I ask a simple question, I do not need the Gettysburg Address as a response. Actual example: I asked what time it was. After giving me the time, it proceeded to let me know multiple things that I can ask it that had absolutely nothing to do with the time. Another example: I asked what the date was. After telling me the date, it said 'did you know I can also order cleaning supplies for you? Ask me...'?! I've already done a bunch of online searching and toggled all of the things in the app that my searches told me to turn off, and yet as others have mentioned on message boards, it continues to do it.Was this review helpful? If it was, by the way I can also tell you the top 10 most purchased spatulas and the average annual temperature in Patterson, New Jersey. Try asking me things like...	2	February 4, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I‚Äôve complained on multiple occasions to Alexa phone support only to be told that they will write a trouble ticket and forward to their team ‚Ä¶without ANY resolve!Here‚Äôs the problem, like most of you I have a select amount of Pandora stations which I frequently listen to. Up until 3 months ago I was able to listen to Kap Slap Radio (on Pandora). When I tell Alexa to play that station she instead plays Cap One Radio (which isn‚Äôt worth listening). I used to be able to request that station without a hitch, but something has happened (I‚Äôm guessing during an update).As I mentioned before, Alexa support is useless and does nothing to correct this issue!!!***Update - So a day after posting my review, I recieved a voicemail from someone at Amazon saying that they'd like to speak with me to try and make things better... I called them back right away and it was only a generic Amazon customer service number (so there was no way to get in touch with Timothy).I also received an email stating to reach them back otherwise they won't reach back out to me again. Basically, it was simple formalities for someone leaving a negative review for an Amazon product. Very Disappointing!!!	1	July 22, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I've bought Alexa from the 1st generation and on.  What I've noticed,  is that over time even as I upgraded to the newest generation. They improved, but voice recognition sucks. It's too sensitive sometimes and you have to scream at it other times.  I wish I invested in a different product. Sound quality sucks even with the echo.  I have 3 dots and 1 echo.  I get more angry at Alexa every year I have her around.	3	January 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Got this on a Prime Day bundle with a LIFX smart bulb. Therein lies the problem. Overall, Alexa seems to work well most of the time. But I have two issues with the Echo Dot/Alexa.First is the voice quality. When Alexa speaks it's very muddy. If there's any background noise it's very difficult to understand her. Surprisingly though, when I play music through the Echo Dot it sounds remarkably good. Much better than I anticipated from a speaker so small. IMO, better than the Google (Nest) Home Mini.Second is the integration with the LIFX bulb. Often Alexa will respond that the bulb cannot be located. Then some random number of days pass and she will suddenly see the bulb again. Then 1-3 days later, she looses it again. Very frustrating considering Amazon chose to bundle this bulb with the Echo and it's so unreliable. When she can't find it, Google Assistant and Homekit both have no trouble at all.On the plus side, integration with Amazon services is great. And she's been extremely reliable interfacing with my Sonos One SL speaker. I can ask for any music on Sirius/XM, Apple Music or Amazon Music and she always comes through!	3	December 6, 2020	1
Echo Dot	When this product works, it works very well. Other times it can't understand what you're asking for, and for one suggested topic, it just goes in circles. I'm in a group where we're using Alexa, and we're supposed to get the daily health tip, but instead I get the daily joke; and for the daily aphorism, I get a loop of nonsense. I do like the chair yoga program but it's hard to get Alexa to stop at the end. Although I didn't think of using Alexa to contact Amazon when the wrong product was delivered. That might have been helpful.	3	November 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Sometimes Alexa will announce something about a product it thinks it heard in a conversation or ask if we want more information about it without first been addressed by name. Makes me wonder just how much conversation is being collected by  Mr Bezos for his later listening pleasure or marketing plans.	3	March 12, 2022	1

Echo Dot	It‚Äôs exactly the same as my Alexa Echo except one VERY important thing. (At least to me) The sound. If you turn this dot all the way up you can stand over it and have a perfect conversation over it and music is not up I can‚Äôt even say loud because this will not get close to loud. So if you want it for a child‚Äôs room for music or anything it would be perfect. But not for everyday stuff. I use mine (Echo) for timers, music, and white noise. But I have to move it around, so I bought this one thinking it exactly the same except smaller, so I‚Äôll put the big one upstairs and the smaller one in the living room. But, no I was going to return it, but it will be fine for the kid‚Äôs playroom, they will just never be able to ‚Äúturn it up‚ÄùExample volume 5 on my Echo sounds about the same as volume 10 on the dot	3	June 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This was a gift to us because we liked the sound quality of the same unit my sister-in-law has. I've heard too many negative things about the privacy as far as what it hears, and I've also heard it can prompt young children to do not such good things. We only use it on occasion for music, and little else, (used it a lot for holiday music over the holidays) otherwise it sits turned off, or in a cupboard.	3	January 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Alexa is limited as to what she can tell you and gives up after one try. Frustrating when trying to get information, and she will keep going to the same website. She definitely won't replace a computer for research. Alexa can also be wordy / annoying when trying to help - having to interrupt her to say stop. Amazon music is overall disappointing as the same genre songs are played over and over - you wind up specifying songs and artists. ""Play more like this"" gives you one extra song by the artist - then Alexa plays the same old repertoire ad nausium. Not every song you can think of is available, and Alexa will pick the latest artist if the song is a remake - annoying when you want to hear the original (or don't know the artist of the original song.) Another person with another account lives with me, and their Echo 3 dot plays song through mine, even though they are on separate accounts and in different rooms and not within earshot of the other (how does that happen?) You wind up unplugging Alexa to avoid unwanted music. Pluses are the great sound quality - Alexa's ability to understand you and respond from a distance. Annoyances aside - I'll think I'll keep her!"	3	July 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	"First off - I love my Alexa and I've gone all in on these things.  We have the big Echo in the kitchen and a dot in all three bedrooms (with another one in the garage attached to one of those chargers that lets me take it outside wirelessly).What infuriates me is that I pay fifteen bucks a month for a family plan so that my son can listen to Old Town Road on a loop in one room, my daughter can sing along with Elsa in her room, and my wife and I can rock out to Deer Tick downstairs.  That's the American dream, right?But it's JUST a dream.  If you tell the dot in my son's room to play sleep sounds, it turns off Nora Jones Radio downstairs and starts playing Ocean Waves there instead of in his room.  I've tried naming the device with the Alexa app and saying ""Play Rain Forest Sounds in Jackson's Room"" but it will inevitably turn OFF the Little Mermaid soundtrack in my daughter's room and play it in there anyway - causing her to get out of bed and complain when I just want them to go to sleep.I figured out a delicate order that will bring balance if I start with the Disney music or audiobook of Harry Potter in her room and THEN tell Alexa to play sounds  in his room with a seemingly endless list of commands (""play rain forest sounds"" ""No, I do not want to pay extra for HD quality forest sounds"" ""enable loop"") but then we're married to sitting in silence downstairs until we go to bed because we don't want to risk changing the noises in their rooms by asking for some Langhorne Slim while we relax on the couch.But of course, if I've got something I'm grooving to during the day downstairs, my son is inevitably going to go into his room and ask for Megadeath (where the HECK did he learn what Megadeath is?! I'm looking at you, Uncle Steve) and, while his room remains quiet, my Frightened Rabbit disappears and it's Symphony of Destruction blasting into my living room.What the heck am I paying for a family plan for?  Maybe I ought to have just one Alexa device that I move from room to room.  When you ask a device to produce some kind of sound, why isn't it THAT device that responds?"	1	September 15, 2020	0
Echo Dot	The Dot does not seem to process requests as well as our old/original style Alexa. It‚Äôs possible that it‚Äôs the operators fault since he doesn‚Äôt keep updated with the massive amount of information emailed to him. Still it can be quite frustrating.	3	March 20, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"Constantly bombarded with 'her' saying, ""by the way..."" when I set an alarm, timer, ask the weather, etc. I don't need 'her' constantly annoying me with useless information or targeted marketing. And there is absolutely no way to turn it off! From Amazon Customer Service: ""Alexa occasionally provides feature hints or other information she believes to be useful to customers and there is no setting for turning these off currently.""I cannot wrap my head around why there is no way to completely turn off ‚Äúby the way..‚Äù notifications. I understand that this feature might be useful to some, and is probably a good marketing technique generally. It makes sense to have it on as a default, then, but to have no option to opt out if you find it annoying and invasive?? That‚Äôs such a turn-off. I‚Äôm researching other smart devices, because this is annoying beyond belief."	2	March 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I kept it but echo really lacks mid-range & treble. I was going to buy Samuel Jackson's voice but he does not have skills. Not only that but apparently Amazon realized he was popular so the price went from a buck to $5. I was rushed for time or otherwise this would have been returned. So you know my hearing has issues in the higher range, however I can hear mid & higher ranges well with other speakers. This speaker down fires into the plastic base & has been noted by others its muffled sound. Then Alexa's low nasal voice tone amplify's the problem.Addition 8/8/21  I found another voice just by asking Alexa to change her voice. It is a male and heenunciates, not the nasal verbage from Alexa. Note - don't even consider using logic questions with Alexa, its an act of frustration.	3	August 1, 2021	1

I end up #%?!$ by the time I get the dumb thing to cooperate.As if all of that isn‚Äôt bad enough, this device is just one big ad for Amazon.

Echo Dot	If Alexa is an ‚Äúassistant‚Äù using artificial ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù, then why is it more inconvenient to use and interactions leave me cursing her for being stupid? After two years of using two Echo Dot‚Äôs, I‚Äôve decided these things are really only good for listening to music (with Amazon Music of course, which is crap) and pretty decent for turning on/off smart lights. But ask her to perform simple routines and you get a lot of ‚Äúhmm, I don‚Äôt know that one.‚Äù She‚Äôs useless! The majority of the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù features require me to use the app. Want Alexa to turn on a light at a certain time‚Ä¶ break out the app and program a routine, because asking her to do that is impossible. I have more frustrating arguments with her than intelligent assistance. Bottom line, buy a Bluetooth speaker, use any number of Alexa app alternatives (Apple HomeKit, Google Home, IFTTT, etc. - there are dozens out there) and leave Alexa sitting on the virtual store shelf where she can assist at the only things she‚Äôs good at‚Ä¶ being in the way and collecting dust. Seriously, what good is a virtual assistant that you have to do everything yourself in an app? When Siri is better at being an AI than your product is, you‚Äôve got problems‚Ä¶ Amazon! And I‚Äôm not anti-Amazon in any way. Just telling it like it is. Alexa is basically Phoebe, but ask her to sing Smelly Cat and you‚Äôll likely get ‚Äúhmm, I don‚Äôt know that one.‚Äù	2	August 19, 2021	0

Echo Dot	This is the entry level, Echo to the entire Amazon echo world. However, you will be very bitterly disappointed at this entry-level speaker. The sound is truly awful and it mimics that of a very cheap speaker. It is almost impossible to hear the speaking voice for directions and request by ALEXA. Any type of music has muffled sound very very poor mid range if any mid range at all. This is the worst sound from the worst speaker you will ever hear. If you are interested in getting into the a LEX a world by an echo that is a step up from this one. Do not get this one.	1	October 16, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I‚Äôm sure user error but I tried to make a to do list and the next day it couldn‚Äôt find it. Other than that and music not sounding the best on it it‚Äôs good.	3	April 6, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"My husband bought our very first Alexa for my birthday because he thought I'd enjoy the ""company"" since I work from home. We've not even had it for a year, and the one he bought me now only acknowledges the wake word, but doesn't do anything you ask it. Even after factory resetting it multiple times, and even though it's never been dropped, damaged, or wet. I contacted customer support and was told these devices only have a 90 day warranty, so our best bet is to just buy another one when they go on sale next. We've bought 5 other devices since the first, and now we're worried that all 5 will eventually fail like the first one. Not sure this is worth the $200+ every year if they're all going to go out like this one, especially with the limited amount of stuff they actually do. The only real thing we use them for is playing music while we do chores (which is great when your hands are soapy, dirty, or covered in oil), or turning off the lights when we're on the couch and in bed and don't want to have to get up again to turn them off. It is at least cool that you can group the devices together and then play music on all of them at once if you want, or that you can drop in on other rooms instead of yelling at each other. Other than that, how can we justify spending that kind of money on something that won't last and is just an ""okay"" speaker otherwise? It's just like my Apple Watch - expensive and useful in theory, but in practice not worth the badge. You use it for a couple of things, but it's definitely not as useful as they've told us."	2	September 30, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Stops playing because it keeps saying there‚Äôs been no activity!  It‚Äôs because I‚Äôm listening to the music!!!!  Bought for my business but is always shutting off. Gonna have to figure something else out.	3	March 28, 2022	1
Echo Dot	When it works, it is a fantastic device; got it during the buy a 1 month subscription of Amazon Music, get a free Alexa and very happy with my purchase.When it doesn‚Äôt work however - Alexa can only know so much; sometimes she‚Äôll either give you the wrong answer (Alexa assuming a similar question) or she won‚Äôt know.And then when she doesn‚Äôt know, Amazon has a program that allows Amazon users to answer questions for other Alexa owners. This program is ultra sensitive with the questions you ask (even if they‚Äôre not offensive.)For example, even though Jeffrey Epstein did terrible things, the Alexa program won‚Äôt tell you where his island is located. I understand the connection, but I guess everyone Jeffrey Epstein said hello to is also off limits.	3	August 20, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Distortion of audio starts at number eight through ten. Need a replacement. Just last week was the first time I set it up and used it.To much bass in the speaker system.Can it be adjusted with software. I not please let me return the dot and get a new replacement.	3	February 15, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"Amazon KNOWS people don't live solitary lives, we all have friends, many of us have kids. These devices shouldn't be able to spend real money with a ""YES"" but they can, and though you can change the settings, the reason why they're shipped like that is very clear, they want your accidentally spent money, and morally, that's like bars getting all their money from people with serious life problems. Rethink your strategies if you value your souls."	3	December 25, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Satisfecha con Alexa .	2	October 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	It‚Äôs a pretty decent speaker for basic demands, ordering, timers, etc‚Ä¶ but the sound quality could be a little better, speaker distorts easily with bass. But you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a smart speaker with decent sound quality the Echo 4th gen sounds pretty damn good for it‚Äôs size and it truly delivers small to medium room filling sound. I also recommend if you are an Apple Fan the HomePod Mini has pretty good sound quality as well.	3	December 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"David Josue was my customer service chatbot / person.  I own multiple Echo device including an echo, FIreTV, several dots throughout my house.  They all work great except one of the new 3rd generation Dots recently purchased.  That new Dot drops my music streams around 8-10 times per hour, sometimes more...sometimes every song...and has done it right from the start.So what do I do?  I go online to request an exchange for a new functional Dot.  The system FORCES me to chat or speak on the phone with a customer service rep.  Okay, irritating, especially when I could have simply opted to return the item for a refund, and then buying another new one to accomplish this same task.  But, I'll do it.Over 2 hours later, after chatting with David through this time, I've provided lots of ridiculous info, router make and model, distance from router, other device info, etc., some of which may be relevant, but also including a DNA sample (kidding), and get this - approving his request for an Amazon rep to conduct a house visit to gather debug info from the Dot....?!?!?  Seriously, for a $30 device?!  I say ""sure!"" because at this point, I think they make this process as long and drawn out to dissuade people from getting this done...what else am I to think?  What would you think?So, David concludes by saying this will take several days to have the development team triage my data and get back to me via email about next steps...Meanwhile my device dropped the stream 11 times in a little over an hour while chatting with David.  He wraps our chat session by asking if he has addressed all my concerns and questions.  I tell him, well, ""No, not satisfactorily, but you know that don't you David?""  He responds -""Perfect! Have a great evening.""So now, I'm all in to see how utterly absurd this process will be to exchange the Dot for one that functions properly.  It goes without saying that I will not be recommending Echo devices to anyone and will be regaling them with the request for a home visit by Amazon before honoring the exchange request.  I seriously doubt anyone, including you kind readers, will believe it!  But, it's true.  I swear on my dog's life.So, what will come next??  I don't know but am waiting in awe of this stupidity and will update as it goes....UPDATE:  the second Dot that came in the order with the first one is now also dropping pandora streams, so it'll be a return for both, especially since I've not received the aforementioned email from the development team wanting to swing by the house for a debug and beer session.  I guess I'm done buying Echo devices until they work this out."	1	August 29, 2019	0
Echo Dot	I bought this to replace our Alexa echo from 2016.  We love our Alexa echo and use it everyday.  So I wanted an upgrade.  the new one 3rd gen the sound is marbled.  I cannot listen to podcasts or any lyrics on it as its so hard to understand.  the oldest one we have is amazingly clear but its been breaking up a little after 7 years of daily use.	2	July 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I won an Echo Dot from a local radio station. I am happy I did not go and buy this smart speaker because it does not meet my expectations. You cannot change the base in this speaker. It is far too much bass and not enough treble so  all of the words spoken on a radio station or audio book are muffled. Alexa is very responsive but she tells me I cannot increase the treble.	3	December 15, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Negative: Gives you incomplete or false information to encourage you to purchase through Amazon.Example: I needed a lemon to make muffins and asked when the local Walmart opened, Alexa refused to acknowledge the store 3 miles down the road and would only give me stores farther than 100 miles from me. I then asked for the nearest Subway, it listed the Subway that used to be in the local Walmart pre-pandemic. Do not ask Alexa for information, as it will mislead you.Positive: It connects to and controls smart home devices fairly easily, with minor bugs.Example: I can turn on and control some settings on an air conditioner, but it doesn't read the temperature correctly so I can't tell it to increase or decrease based on that. Works great for binary controls though, like light switches.	3	July 31, 2021	1
Echo Dot	So I've tested my Echo dot on a few devices and it's perfectly ok if all you need is a cheap Alexa enabled device to play a little music or control your lights.  That's what it's good at.What I didn't anticipate was that the base would be so overpowering that listening to voices on podcasts, the news, or youtube videos would be near impossible.  Imagine everything is down pitched a whole octave.  I didn't have enormously high expectations but a cheap no-name brand speaker does better than this.  Going into settings and cranking the bass all the way down helps a little, but not enough.  That said if the only thing you will do with your speaker is listen to music, you might enjoy the bass-heavy sound.  Just know that using this to listen to people talk or listen to dialogue is probably out of the question.My other critique is that these speakers should really have an audio-in jack instead of audio out, or better yet, both.  If I wanted to have an audio out jack, I'd buy an Alexa Input device for half the price.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  Maybe the regular Echo and Echo Studio are better.	3	June 18, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I ordered two echo dots and I was able to connect one with no problem but the second one I could not connect I ended up needed to contact customer service and they couldn‚Äôt get it to connect either. They did send me a replacement with no charge as long as I send the broken one back. But the replacement worked great. They do exactly what an echo dot is supposed to do. I have one in my bedroom and one in my living room, both rooms are on different stories so I live that I‚Äôm able to connect to each of them to make announcements to the other part of the house.	3	September 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I bought this product thinking I could sync it with my Alexa devices but truthfully this one and the others I have bought have been a huge let down. Even after you sync them which is a process that could go a lot easier and download the skills the product doesn‚Äôt perform properly. You could speak right into the speaker or from any distance really and still have to repeat yourself a lot. Even after repeating yourself it may say that skill, song or book isn‚Äôt available even though it‚Äôs something the device has already done before. You tell the device to play in a group and it repeats the group and song of choice and still only plays on one speaker or not at all. The funny thing is it can hear really well. I could be in a place with no devices and make a noise and it would hear it and respond. Also it will just randomly blink a different color when nothing is wrong and completely stop responding or not respond at all.	1	August 30, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Never got to use. Would not Pair with my iPhone	2	October 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I don‚Äôt like that this Alexa is always flashing ‚Äúgreen‚Äù circle, as if it‚Äôs always listening to everything being said. So naturally, I‚Äôve unplugged it. I only use it when playing worship music in the background. I don‚Äôt use this device much. Not sure how the light is supposed to work with it. I‚Äôm so confused. Anyone have any suggestions or same experience I‚Äôm having? Not a fan.	3	January 4, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Ordered two, but they won't link together.  There's a delay in sound sounding like an echo in the songs.  I turned them both off after trying to link them for several hours.  Went back to my tried and true stereo system.  No issues, no frustrations.  Technology is not always better.	3	January 25, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"I've used Echo dots for close to 5 years now. The features and functionality are limited at best, and have hardly advanced at all in those years.At some point, they started a feature where Alexa responds with ""By the way, [...]"" after you give a command that does not warrant a reply, such as ""set a timer"" or ""turn on the light"". These are incredibly intrusive, obnoxious, uncalled for - this is a device, not a human, and it has no place interjecting additional BS when I ask it to perform a simple task.They've taken this one step further recently, however, by turning those ""By the way"" interjections into actual advertisements. I just set a time and my Echo Dot responded with ""By the way, did you know we now have premium timer tones available for purchase? Would you like to purchase one?""You have absolutely no right piping advertisements directly into my home, especially for a product I PAID MONEY FOR. This isn't some freemium app supported by ads. Shame on you Amazon. This is the final straw - I'm ripping these sad, useless devices out and replacing them all with Google Home minis which at least don't try to advertise to me (yet).On another note: I once left a review on an older generation of Amazon Echo, and someone from Amazon literally called me on my mobile phone to ask about the review - but then asked me to provide personal information to confirm it was actually me they were talking to. Are you kidding me? You're going to call me, unsolicited, and then ask me to prove who I am just so you can address a review that I didn't ask to be contacted about? Y'all have seriously misunderstood (or just completely disregarded) the concept of customer experience. What a sad company you've turned into."	1	August 19, 2021	0
Echo Dot	device is bulky	3	May 14, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Okay, so I prefer Amazon's device over Google's even though it's not as intuitive or useful. You have to hook it to a surround sound system if you don't like crackle and speaker pop. In spite of this, I just hate Google enough that Amazon's products like these are my go to choice.	3	January 28, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It's cheap and does its job somewhat, but it's really unreliable. Sometimes voice commands don't work and integrations with things such as smart lights are very finicky. Also severe delays randomly, Alexa will do the task a few seconds after you give the command. Wouldn't recommend for any important tasks.	3	January 31, 2022	1
Echo Dot	there should be a way to easily manage the devices connected to alexa if i replace a tv in my house alexa should be able to forget the old one etc and also if someone is told by your customer service that they will call you back with a solution they should call you back.	3	January 25, 2022	1

Echo Dot	Set it  up. Great. Gave commands. Great. Within a few hours, my digital pad on my GE stove and my Whirlpool dryer were going nuts!!! I did not download any of these appliance apps. So, I unplugged the DOT and in a few hours, I had my stove and dryer back to normal. Few days later, tried again and it did the same thing to the appliances. Unplugged. Also flipped the main breakers. Waited a few days, then plugged the DOT into a different outlet on a different breaker. Within 24 hours, my TV had viewing issues on some of the channels. Wobbly lines. This lasted for several hours. Unplugged the TV cable and replugged. No luck.  Finally unplugged the DOT. So. Dot is in my closet. I am going to try one more time and reset to factory and try to start the process over again. If it is affecting certain appliances in the house, then I cannot use it. Super disappointed and don't know how to fix.	2	January 11, 2022	0
Echo Dot	One thing that I would suggest is that it is a wireless device not to be plugged in all the time. Seems kind of useless to be located in one particular spot all the time. Low level music and voice are muffled and not very clear	3	February 4, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I previously ordered the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa and it worked out great. It is easy to set up and connects to other devices that are Alexa compatible. I decided to buy a battery base for the Echo dot to make it more portable around the house. That's when I found out that the AUX device pin receptacle was misaligned which prevents the device cable to attach properly. I returned it via UPS as per Amazon Customer Service instruction (which cost me $5 at UPS since I threw away the packaging required to send it back), and I had it replaced with another Echo Dot. I just received it and this one has the same defect. I wonder if Amazon is aware of this quality control issue happening with this product!? This defect will not allow for any AUX device to be attached as an AUX speaker or battery base.	3	June 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	In a world where we literally choose which conglomerate we allow to spy on us, Alexa is the Amazon option.  Trading our privacy for small conveniences.BTW, I did not buy this, it came with a purchase and my son thinks it's cool not having to flip a light switch.	3	January 27, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"This one replaced another Echo Dot (3rd Gen) because the speaker had gone bad after about 3 years.  The new one has a ""tinny"" speaker out of the box.

Echo Dot	In general, the third generation Echo Dot functions as well previous generations, but it makes Alexa sound like she's talking through a pillow. Bizarre! The 3rd Gen Dot may have improved a tad in the quality of music playback; not enough to prevent listening fatigue from setting in very quickly, though. The contours of the new generation are more pleasant to look at. That said, does anyone buy a Dot to look at it?	3	December 10, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Update: Returned.I frequenly interact with my Echo devices, but it's not so easy with the 3rd generation Dot. It is hard for me to understand what Alexa is saying. I tried to adjust the audio, but nothing I tried changed that problem. However, the Dot's audio is fine for listening to the news and music. That, rather than Alexa's voice, comes through clearly.I bought the 3rd gen Dot because many reviews for the 4th generation say it isn't an upgrade from the 3rd, and some say the 4th gen is inferior. I had hoped the Dot would improve on the Echo Flex I was using (it often ignored comands and another device would answer even though the other device was rooms away from where I was and the Flex is just a few feet from me. But Alexa's voice on the Flex was far superior to what it is on the new Dot. I'm not sure I'll keep the Dot. I may fish the Flex out of the trash.	2	January 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I have other voice assistants and do not mind them. The echo dot is good for the most part. It has higher quality sound than some other comparable assistants out there. Seems to hear me for the most part when I am talking to it. My biggest complaint though and something that gets more annoying with time is how intrusive Alexa is. Alexa constantly makes suggestions to me about how I can set modes and automatic weather or traffic updates. I even turned off settings to stop this and I see no changes. When I ask Alexa to turn on a light I do not need it to then blab on about what else Alexa can do. Its honestly annoying as can be. I want to say ""turn on a light"" and she turns on a light nothing else. Or tell me the weather and she tells me the weather. Rather I find that after the short answer to what I asked Alexa to do I get a long drawn out explanation of what else it can do. If this happened once that would be fine but I find that for years after using the echo dot I still get the same explanations over and over. It honestly makes me want to toss the thing in the garbage."	1	June 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I have both Google minis and the Echo dot in my home and the Echo sound is very muffled.  Everything else about it is fine but I just can't get past the poor sound quality and don't think I'd ever buy another.	3	February 13, 2022	1

Echo Dot	"My husband got the Echo ""free"" with an order, and it sat in the box, unused, for a very long time.  So, I thought I would check it out and try it - bad idea!  Sure, I could ask for the weather (not that impressive, really), but when I asked for a certain song to play, ""Alexa"" offered the unlimited music subscription for 14.99/month.  ""NO!""  I said.  Well, my 6-year-old twins were excited to hear the Echo play ""Baby Shark,"" and when I wasn't in the room, they asked for a song and agreed to the music subscription without my knowing!  WHAT?!  Then, despite trying to cancel TWICE, I see a charge in my bank account, resulting in me having to cancel my debit card and file a dispute claim.  Such a hassle and headache.  All because I turned on this stupid speaker for ONE day.  Total rip-off.  Bad idea"	1	September 5, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I have 2 other Echo Dots. I purchased this 3rd one to take in my RV.It is not near as good as my other two. She doesn't answer like she should when asked a question  I know is easy for her.Very disappointed.	3	February 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	When I got the echo dot it was working okay. Didn't always understand everything but I've only had it for less than two weeks and it cuts out and sounds like its skipping on songs and when things are talking. No clue why.

Echo Dot	"I already owned one of the new Alexa's and love the sound and ease-of-use...so did my son, so he kidnapped her from my kitchen to his room!  I bought the Echo Dot because the price was right and thought since it came with the Alexa feature, it would sound just as good.  Unfortunately, while the Dot does still have the same ease-of-use as the larger Alexa, the quality of sound doesn't compare.  The larger Alexa seems to have a more clear quality with music, even when asking her to increase the bass.  I tried the same with the Dot and it does increase the bass, but it becomes a little raspy, like a cheap set of car speakers.I have to admit, I really don't use the Dot or Alexa for anything but to listen to music when I'm downstairs, so, I can't attest to the rest of it's features.  I can say, if you're looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use device, the Echo Dot will suffice.  However, if you don't mind spending a little more to be able to enjoy a better quality sound, the larger Alexa model is definitely the better choice.  In fact, since my son only listens to ""talk radio"", I'm going to switch the devices while he's in school...he'll never know the difference!  HaHa"	3	December 20, 2019	1
Echo Dot	First let me say I love my dot and Alexa! However my dot is not working as it should and I had to take it offline until I can afford to replace it.And replace it I will what's not to like about Alexa I talk with her everyday.	3	February 7, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I bought it for the supposed better sound quality, But I am disappointed. Music sounds good on it, but Alexa's voice is very muffled and difficult to understand. I'm very disappointed that Amazon would put this on the market without correcting the issue.	3	February 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa is still great for a lot things if I am inputting a shopping list, for example. But if I want to know the weather or play music, this 3rd gen Echo is a disappointment. It's sometimes staticy and sometimes lives up to its name ... it echoes or sounds as if it is underwater.I still have one of my 1st gens and its sound quality is much, much better than this.	3	December 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	Not something I would ever buy, gifted to us. Set up and used about a week. I don't need or want constant background music. I don't need her to answer my questions. I can time things for myself. I haven't found a good use for her.	3	February 1, 2022	1
Echo Dot	First time buying a product like this, I'm glad I invested the money into a deal I had found online versus pay the original price. In my opinion, I don't think I would have purchased this for the amount it actually costs, I don't think it's worth it.Overall, it's a decent product. The biggest downfall- IT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT WIFI OR WITHOUT THE DEVICE BEING PLUGGED IN!! Regardless of those MAJOR problems...The Alexa integration is not bad, it does for the most part respond to what you ask and it does entertain all age groups. The timer and reminder settings on the echo dot are extremely convenient. I also love that this is a Bluetooth speaker as well but majorly disappointed in the sound quality!! You do get what you pay for though and this product is not big on size to produce an extreme amount of sound. Again, it could be better but I'm still very glad I have it.I honestly purchased this for the Bluetooth speaker so there are other functions and capabilities I'm sure I'm not aware of that make this product better by chance so take that into consideration if you do decide to buy.	3	June 12, 2020	1
Echo Dot	So we have 3 of these. For some reason, when I call my daughters Alexa, it will make both my daughters and my sons ring. If my son is calling mine, it says its my daughter. Other than that it works great!	3	February 4, 2022	1

Echo Dot	I really like Alexa; it beats the Google Assistant in a lot of ways (not all though) but I will focus on the actual Echo Dot in this review. The speaker has four microphones on it and they pick up voices amazingly well. The speaker looks nice and I really like the buttons on top that make controlling it even easier. I also think that the speaker (actually 3 speakers within) has the potential to sound pretty good. But, there are some issues that really keep me from enjoying this. First: the sound tuning just seems off. It is really bass heavy which would normally be great but since the speaker is so small it just makes everything else sound less pronounced and muddy. Second: the sound randomly becomes distorted sometimes, especially when playing on a Bluetooth speaker. I‚Äôm not talking about a little white noise, I mean it sounds like you‚Äôre losing signal to a radio station; it cuts in and out. Amazon knows about that issue but they haven‚Äôt pushed out an update to fix it as of Feb 2020. So, because of these sound issues, I can‚Äôt really recommend getting an Echo Dot 3rd Gen. The new Google Nest Mini, though less bassy, sounds astonishingly better and what good is a speaker if it sounds bad?	3	February 5, 2020	1
Echo Dot	It was a gift which i appreciated but I discovered this isn't the echo with Time on front......which makes me think why didn't they make them all with a standard time on the front with all of them....it just makes sense to me - but i'll probably place it somewhere as a speaker for music -	3	January 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	This came with a smart bulb which was a good value but I could not get the smart bulb to work with Alexa so I had to unpair them and uninstall the Alexa app and start over from scratch. Needless to say the smart bulb is now sitting on the counter and she is working fine now.	3	January 9, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I replaced an old Echo Dot Gen 2 hoping for improvements.  Yes, it's much louder.  This was my first goal.  However, most of the increased volume is in the BASS region.  Music sounds excellent, but it ruins the clarity of the speech from the IHeart Radio stations, etc.  I tried to adjust the frequency response in the APP but it has very little affect.  I have 6 other models of various types and ages.  They all sound excellent.	3	November 6, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I‚Äôve had an Amazon echo for several years now, my home is almost fully automated and just recently alexa just started to crap out. 1. She can‚Äôt control the lights in the house anymore, she can run her programming but I can‚Äôt tell her ‚Äúkitchen lights 100%‚Äù she acts like the lights aren‚Äôt set up 2. She stopped playing music on Pandora because they are trying to get you to subscribe to Amazon Music 3. If she actually plays what I ask her to she plays it on the wrong echo, I‚Äôll ask for a song in to play in the living room and she‚Äôll play it in the nursery. I don‚Äôt need Megan Thee Stallion blasting in my kids room while he‚Äôs trying to take nap. And if I‚Äôm specific and say play a song on Living Room Echo she tells me it doesn‚Äôt exist half the the time and the other half of the time it‚Äôll work 4. She always mishears me but that‚Äôs been since day one, I put up with it because every thing else worked. I‚Äôm going to sell my 7 echos and make the switch to Google Home	1	July 8, 2022	0

Echo Dot	So we bought this for our retail store, unfortunately, we have to keep telling ALEXA , put on 100.5 , numerous times a day . She just shuts off , mid song ??? Not sure why ??	3	February 22, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I received this as a Christmas gift. I use my Computer, iPad and Android when seeking information. The sound isn't as clear as Siri. I am concerned because it turns on without anyone saying ""Alexa"". Probably paranoid but I feel someone is listening to our conversation as many have suggested."	3	January 20, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I purchased this product to replace the old alexa. This little machine likes to turn on the lights in the middle of the night when your asleep. It has done it several times. I will troubleshoot and if it continues it goes back.	3	January 27, 2022	1
Echo Dot	So this little machine is a very good buy but I don‚Äôt like how I need to pay to hear music and play games. Like I wanted it for music but I don‚Äôt wanna pay. So now I just use it for Bluetooth! Umm it‚Äôs ver convenient! Just those pricey add on‚Äôs. Would I recommend?? Nah not really cause I basically use it as a radio so it‚Äôs really whatever.	2	July 3, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"The device is great, it hears your voice and responds promptly, the volume is more than high enough, the design is nice. However, a few problems gave me a bad taste overall. The device has an AUX input but completely lacks the feature to be used as an AUX speaker (the AUX input is essentially functionally useless). Another issue involves the ""skills"" that Alexa has, one such being the Spotify ""skill"" that allows you to play music on command. The issue arises any time I ask Alexa to play a song or playlist, it doesn't play the song or playlist that I asked but rather some random playlist called ""[name of song] radio,"" which proceeds to play random music."	3	August 12, 2021	1
Echo Dot	This speaker has good sound quality and is fun to use when you get it set up but you almost need a degree in computer engineering to get it set up.  They need to simplify the setup process.	3	February 11, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have purchased 3 over time and haven given one as a gift, and have learn to know that the speaker becomes muffled over time,	3	March 30, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Alexa does not play nice with YouTube Music. This was a deal breaker for me because that is my preferred music app. I switched to Google nest immediately because playing music from my existing playlists was one of my main reasons of getting a smart speaker.	3	January 23, 2022	1
Echo Dot	It's ok but the thing I noticed different from also having the 2nd gen, is that it takes longer to respond to you and sometimes it don't at all, so that's why I only give it 3 stars. I like the look of gen 3 better but I actually prefer the gen 2 over this one because of it's quick response and it can hear you better from far off. I almost thought about just returning the 2 new dots that I have but since they no longer have gen 2 available, I'll just hang onto them. Thought about trading in the older dot for new when I was buying the new dots, now I'm glad I didn't!( I'm not for sure if the 3rd gen echo dot is worst or it's my hotspot, being that I just found out that I'm maxed out on my hotspot. I have the new google nest mini and google nest hub now also and I'm having the same problems with it not working as well sometimes, no response at times.  It could be that this dot works just fine if you are using it with a good internet setup. So I really can't say for sure it's not as good, this has just been what I'm experiencing with this dot.)	3	December 26, 2019	1
Echo Dot	"PLEASE come up with a way for the machine to physically answer you when you call out the Wake word WITH A VERBAL RESPONSE, example good evening user name here HOW MAY I ASSIST  as I am getting sick and tired of having to repeat myself time after time when the machine either does not hear me and or does not answer me when I Do infact speak to it to it plus if these machines are supposed to be ""smart speakers"" why can't they answer questions without responding with ""I don't know that one"" which happens 80% of the time? Furthermore in regards to not being heard that shouldn't happen at all considering I have multiple speakers in my home so there is no reason for the system to not HEAR anyone. in regards to answers to questions it's like the only thing it searches for is the Amazon database & if the desired question & answer is not in the Amazon database it has no clue. I'm seriously thinking about replacing all of my speakers in my house with the Google home equivalent I've been using Google products since Android froyo came out and Google has NEVER ONCE told me it does not know the answer to something. Because I can ask Alexa the same question I ask Google back to back and majority of the time Alexa says she doesn't know the answer whereas  Google gives me the answer immediately something's wrong with that picture &  for god sakes the most important Part is I don't have to repeat myself to Google.I apologize but I'm really irritated with the echo experience and borderline regret the purchase."	1	November 23, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"Alexa has a hard time understanding the names of foreign artists - specifically Korean - as she doesn't listen all the way to the command. Even when I type it into the Alexa app, she somehow gets it incorrect. Also, when I ask for a certain song due to me not having Amazon Music and I use Apple Music she will reply with ""To play specific songs you must have Amazon Music"" or with something very similar. She will say she can't find a specific song on Apple Music when I know for sure the song is there because most of the time I'm..looking at it on Apple Music on my laptop.It is frustrating to have to either type in the song I want Alexa to play or have to repeat myself multiple times for her to understand. If she could understand names, and not default them to ""American"" or ""English speaking"" artists the echo would get a 5/5. Until that is fixed...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't listen to traditionally American/mainstream artists."	3	December 20, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Got it on sale. Never interacted with one till my daughter-in-law used it at Thanksgiving for keeping track of when to make what for dinner and music. I thought it was pretty cool. I still think it's cool tho I don't really need it, just another gadget. I do all those things on my phone.	3	January 3, 2022	1
Echo Dot	Even after downloading downloading Alexa app, she still has no idea where I live. Even with a full address, she can't find Grand Marais, MN! Junk Echo or junk app? Who knows, because they can't talk to each other.	3	January 29, 2022	1
Echo Dot	So I received this as part of a promotion. I had to sign up for amazon music and then received this for $1. I was initially very excited just to have a decent, somewhat portable speaker. Unfortunately there was a bit of a rattle coming from the speaker as soon as I set it up. At first this didn't bother me too much but it got progressively worse over the next couple weeks. Now it sounds like a blown speaker. I've never even come close to turning this up loud so I know it's not my fault. Would love to get a replacement but am not being offered one, likely because it was part of a promotion. I just think that if they're only going to offer the $1 back, then they should also refund the amount paid for amazon music, seeing as getting the echo for $1 was the only reason I signed up for it.	2	January 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Spotify does not work very well! When you have more than one device it gets kind of slow‚Ä¶ it keeps saying: this command is not supported right now!	3	March 12, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I got this as a gift to use in my workroom basically just as a radio because it has a ""FREE"" listening option.  I have no desire for yet another bill every month so I figured it'd be okay and save space. I thought the free version would just have normal commercials and adds but the music would be fine. Well the ""FREE"" listening option without signing up and paying every month is a joke. No matter what style of music you choose to listen to it only shuffles through 15 to 20 songs from each style you choose. It plays the same handful of songs over and over. At least half of these songs are lesser known or lesser wanted versions like the Whitesnake ""hobo"" version of ""Here I go Again"" if you ask to hear 80's hair metal for example. The volume of each song is different as well. Some are a lot louder than others and you have to keep adjusting the volume as you listen if you want it all the same. The speaker strength is nothing to brag about either even for such a small device.  Also, the music styles you chose will sometimes be contaminated with songs from other styles. Adding insult to injury Amazon sticks their own spoken adds in among the terrible selection of ""FREE"" music you get telling you to join up for better options. And yes, I know this thing is supposed to be used for and with other stuff and I'm assuming if you pay every month it'd be a million times better. I'm just giving my opinion on what I wanted it for. If you don't sign up for the paid version you're basically getting a 45-minute commercial that repeats. So, if you just want to listen to something for free as a radio with no hassle and no extra bill every month...just buy a radio."	2	February 10, 2020	0

Echo Dot	"I am a tech geek.I have been a proponent of the benefits of the technological innovations since the late 1990's, and I don't mind dropping a dime on things I am generally interested in, or something I see genuine benefit from, which I why I purchased 2 Alexa Dots.No one suggested: ""Oh by the way... an Echo Dot would be nice"", or ""Did you know..."", to try to compel me into purchasing something I didn't want or need.Before buying the dots, I was tentative and went back and forth between this and Google's product. But someone gifted us Facebook's Portal, which embedded Alexa by default, and we liked how Alexa integrated our IoT devices perfectly. So after noticing that general conversations turned into FB ads, we replaced the portal with our 2nd Dot.Not long after, the 'Oh, by the ways' started creeping in, prompting me to extensively investigate how to turn these unwarranted invasions prompts off. Towards the end of summer, every other 'Alexa' request/engagement became an unwarranted invasion of thought, focus, activity.  The last time I used ""the Dot"" was after I needed an '11 minute timer for pasta', while preparing a family meal, only to be nudged by some inane BS, this multi-billion dollar corporation NEEDED for me to purchase.Really?If I really wanted whatever the Amazon algorithms presumed would be a good thing for me at that most inopportune time, I would research it, and purchase it myself without a DAMN prompt!Purchasing anything related to Alexa or the Echo Dot, is like paying a telemarketer to call you just because you want the benefit of your telephone."	1	December 20, 2021	0
Echo Dot	Sound: The sounds is alright. For a cheap-ish bluetooth speaker it isn‚Äôt too bad, but depending on how you use you will find some limitations. Sonically no one will be blown away, but it functions.Connectivity: This has been a nightmare. I have two of these. They will randomly show the blue and orange lights, go back into setup modes, turn on Alexa from disabled and require completely removing the pairing and starting over. Super frustrating and both units do it. Bluetooth seems pretty good, but can delay at times. I have yet to have any luck with the aux cable, though... on either of them.Alexa: It can hear me and most of the time understands very basic stuff. It doesn‚Äôt integrate with a lot of stuff I use, so it severely limits functionality.Compatibility: No Google support sucks. I have hoping to use the speakers in a right and left config as they had been setup, but you are limited in that regard. Play Music not having native support sucks, but I can just connect to bluetooth. It would great to have the wizardry available outside of some weird backend stuff that Amazon is doing on their servers.Summary: If you get this free or for a dollar or something, awesome. 100% no-go at full price. If you have invested in another ecosystem, make sure to verify full compatibility, even at half off. You can pickup wireless speakers for around the same price that are better, but lack Alexa. If Alexa is what you desperately want, then this is totally for you.	2	August 12, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"Alexa Echo Dot is great when it works.  Mine stopped working.  After several times on the phone with the ""help"" Alexa was still broken.  They told me to try several things.  When that didn't work I was told to wait a few days and call back if it still does not work.  When called back they went through the same steps that didn't work the first time.  I gave up and bought another one.  Alexa is great as long as you don't have any problems with it."	3	September 24, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"10/25/2020: For the last two days all Echo says is I'm having trouble connecting. Everything else works and connects fine. They will have to go back. I'll go back to using my previous gens. They say it from time to time but at least when they do I don't feel bad about wasting my money. I was sure the wifi would be more robust in this model but I was wrong.10/23/2020: Just as I suspected, the music was tailored to make me want to try Amazon Music. It was nice, but no go. I have a huge music library that I can play for free any time I like. I'm chronically ill so I'm rarely in a music or dancing mood. Covid has only made my life harder than it was, like it has for everyone. I do really like the device so I upped my rating to 4-stars and won't be needing the new gen that is getting really poor reviews. Saved some money there that I will use for mounting solutions and a skin or two at some point. Everyone please stay safe and well!10/22/2020: Reset the Echo and it still couldn't play my audiobook. Tried each of the other two Echos and neither of them would play it either. Something's up, but honestly, this is way at the bottom of my list. I figure it will work itself out later. The reason I upped it to 3-stars is that when I asked for music, something I never do because I don't want to trigger ads, Echo hit a home-run with each and every one on each device. Perfect music for me that made me cry. Amazon knows me way too well. Keeping all three, non-playing audiobooks be damned.Original: I don't ask much of my device, the weather (on occasion), sunset / sunrise time, lights on and off. My first test echo failed. Asked to play audiobook and she told me four times ""playing, how long was left, etc."", but never made a sound. Total and complete waste of my time."	1	October 19, 2020	0

Echo Dot	First, I did adjust the Audio settings in the Alexa app (this is my 3rd echo) but no matter what it's so much bass & reverb, I don't use it as much.

Echo Dot	A veces no me identifica si no le hablo fuerte pero nada del otro	3	April 13, 2022	1
Echo Dot	So far I've mostly only used my Alexa for listening to Spotify, so I am not sure of her full potential, however I do see areas that could be improved. For example, if I ask her a question while the music is playing, she won't pause the music to answer the question but instead talks over the music which I find a bit annoying. Since they do favor towards Amazon music, I am unable to ask her to like songs or add songs to playlists on my Spotify account. Another thing I noticed is that I will ask her a question and she will not answer or won't give me the results when asked to read my notifications. I also wish the device was wireless so I could take it around the house without needing an outlet. Aside from these issues listed above, I have enjoyed using my Echo.	3	May 29, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"I've had this for 2wks, now. It worked like a dream fresh out of the box. However, it seems like the longer I have it the more problems I have. The voice recognition is hit or miss.  If I wanted to be ignored every other time when I called it's name, I'd talk to my kids. At first I thought it may be a noise issue. (Too much stuff going on in the background.) Unfortunately, it will do the same thing when it's dead silent. Other occasions, it will recognize that I've said ""Echo"" but will not complete the demand.  For example, I'll say ""Echo,"" it lights up and it lights up. I say ""Set alarm for 0430"" almost immediately after and it's a coin toss as to if it will actually do anything.  It also tends to sporadically stop playing Amazon Music. I haven't had any problems with that when playing the local stations. I've checked the connection when it acts up and WiFi seems to be 100%, so I don't believe any of this is simply a connection issue.  I'm not sure if this is a regular thing, but it also tends to ""ding"" randomly.  Like it's reconnecting or something, but there wasn't anything wrong with the connection that I've seen."	3	December 3, 2019	1

Echo Dot	I‚Äôm extremely unhappy with Amazon. I‚Äôve been a very loyal Prime member for a very long time and the fact that you aren‚Äôt honoring your offer is aggravating,maddening and saddening and now has me questioning why I pay for Prime benefits. I was offered, without asking, a refund and told I could keep the device if it was ever to arrive. Obviously I chose to to do this. Well my echo finally arrived but it has been deactivated and I‚Äôm unable to use it. Let me state; I understand the security issues as these devices are attached to our accounts and appreciate that Amazon takes a proactive stance here however now my device is now nothing more than a paperweight. I contacted Amazon and have been told that I will need to repay for the device or they will not release the lock on it. So then the offer I received has not been upheld and I‚Äôm forced to either pay for it or have a useless piece of plastic and metal that will be sitting in a dump decomposing long after all of us are gone. Very disappointing.  Why offer something that you don‚Äôt plan to honor!!??  In the past I‚Äôve had issues with orders and deliveries as I order, quite literally, everything from Amazon and they are typically resolved to my satisfaction or at least in a matter that makes sense however this time you really dropped the ball, Amazon.	2	January 10, 2021	0

Echo Dot	"I have a gen 1, and the voice that comes out is crisp and clear.I bought another gen 3 and it's louder, and has more bass.Problem is, that when you want voice interaction, it's so basie, it's muddled.Music is much better for sure, but you use and receive voice more than listening to music.Personally I didn't need ""louder"" so much, and voice tone was fine for me.And lately it has problems answering the wake word. By the 3rd request I find myself shouting at it to WAKE UP. Sometimes it just wont respond. It won't wake up when it's playing to ask it to stop and powering down is the only way to abort it's current actions.Often, a light ring appears at the wake word, then quickly goes out , even with repeated requests.These are server problems and that should be noted, but since Amazon has no feedback links this is where I complain.This gen is junk in my opinion. Expensive junk.Now 4-8-20 A growing list of gen 3 problems. It has been a recurring problem for Alexa to light up on the wake word but the command is not followed and the light just goes out. Over & over. It just has response problems.Now I asked it to play something from Amazon music and it says its playing, but no audio comes out. Over & over. I cancelled my music subscription because no one is answering their CS line. But I wondered if it would be the same on my gen 1 and lo and behold it played. It's pretty plain (to me anyway) that gen 3 is a lemon. Oh and about the gen 3? I powered it down and it played just fine.Amazon, you can take your gen3's and throw them in the lake. It's just an annoying piece of electronics."	2	January 4, 2020	0
Echo Dot	"I ordered many items to set my 'smart home' up, which included several different echo's. Apart from missing some commands now and then, their functionality overall is decent. But Amazon has really dropped the ball on how it handles music, and trying to get it resolved has been the worst customer service issue we've ever ran into with Amazon. If you're wanting music, and you are single, go for it. If you're not single, here's what you could be in for- my wife had prime for years. But when it comes to buying, setting up, and using technology, that's my area. Well, as it turns out, you can NOT do that and have music work. Because I don't pay for a second prime account (why would I? She's the shoppaholic) all of our devices will not allow us to prime music, because they are 'mine'. Amazon customer service has been useless getting this resolved. This leaves us with two options- cancelling her account and changing everything she uses, is signed into, all of the stored credit card info, losing whatever benefits she has, resetting tv app etc. because it will no longer work. Or we (I) need go through and setup all of the devices all over again under account, which who knows what issues I would have tying them back into the security system, cameras, thermostat, light switches, outlets, door locks, and whatever else we have. They're literally in the same house, at the same address, with our same names as everything else. But how horrible it would be for Amazon to let us use these -speakers- with the music that we pay for. If I had it to do over again I would have went with the ""other brand"" smart home devices instead. I will not be adding any other Amazon devices going forward."	2	February 10, 2020	0

Echo Dot	Horrible integration with their own Amazon music (unlimited subscription) app which can't cast to the device. Thought of using the cast feature because the bad recognition system doesn't understand what I'm trying to make it play in the first place. Alexa app is another level of stupidity. It has a play tab but you can't search from there and even can't play anything at times as it keeps crashing. Ridiculously buggy piece of software. Hardware is fine.	1	October 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Good solid construction, heavy (in a good way) everything we have come to love by Alexia, but one big but the sound of Alexia voice is terrible. I am hard to offend but the sound is SO MUFFLED, it is to the point of distraction. What on the lovely green Earth were they thinking? I gave it one star only for the fact that it does work, but the sound is worse than bad, it is Terrible. It sounds like it is under a pillow. If you are thinking that it is not too much different than say, the first generation, you would be wrong. There is a case of back sliding here, I cannot understand why, I have a second one coming, ( I got it on a free promotion and it will sit on my shelf) I have a 1 generation show, several 1 generation Echo Dots and even though they might be considered ""old"" the sound is better than what I expected.

Echo Dot	Cheap tinny sound makes listening to music an awful experience.  Luckily, the Echo Dot has an audio jack, which I used to plug into my Bose computer speakers for amazing sound.  If you have Apple Music, Alexa doesn't fully understand Apple Music such as playlists you have created.  It defaults to an artist's essentials playlist every time.  I shouldn't complaint too much since I got my Echo Dot for a penny with 1 month of Amazon Music, which I cancelled right away.  Apple Music is so much better.  Bottomline, I wouldn't pay full price for an Echo Dot.	2	April 29, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I received this as a free promo via SiriusXM. I was unsure about the alexa due to some things I have heard about it. The first couple weeks I had it I enjoyed it. Especially as I painted my room I could play music and change it up when needed. About three weeks after having it I muted the voice recognition because it would randomly tell me things or ask questions to my conversations.Then about 3 days later around 130 am I was in a deep sleep. All the sudden I was awaken too loud music. I jumped up turned it off, looked and voice recognition was still off. So i just figured it was a ""bug"". Went back to sleep and some time later it did it again. I unplugged it and has been unplugged since, unless I need music for cleaning etc.Maybe I just have not taken the time to get to know how to use it, but I also feel as though its not something i would really get into."	3	October 21, 2020	1

Echo Dot	Ok. So, I rarely write negative reviews. But I'm so shocked by how bad all of my 3 Alexa's are functioning that I have to leave feedback.First of all, expect at least half of the functions not to be working. Even the easiest things like changing the wifi on your Alexa. Or Alexa recognizing devices. My devices are all about 3 months old and since the beginning, everything was a fight. Connecting lamps was a fight. Using spotify is a fight (she chooses the wrong songs all the time, even if the song is super popular).And Fire Tv has been the worst so far. I got a Fire Tv stick just so I could use voice control for Netflix or Prime. But from the very start Alexa only searched for movies but never played them. Costumer service could not help I had just had to accept. If you want to increase or decrease volume, she suddenly mutes the tv all together. Lately she hasn't done anything for fire tv at all.I got all 3 Alexa echo dots at the same time, thinking they would work. One of them I gave to my father. The app is supposed to work on Android 5.0 or higher. Of course the app did not work on his Android 5.01 phone. After hours of trying to fix it, I connected it to my own phone which is actually not a good idea but I had no choice. Anyway, of course connecting smart lamps (philips hue) took ages too.In the end I have to say the amount of time I struggled with Alexa overweighs the time she was of use. I just tried to connect my Alexa to a new wifi and guess what? Even this easy function does not work because Amazon makes everything to complicated and wants Alexa to connect to my phone's wifi, and not directly to the wifi itself.Facepalm. Overall I'm really disappointed, Amazon. By the way, if you use Alexa to send messages, expect her to cut you off at random so you have to repeat the whole message again.The amount of rage trying to make it work is insane. And despite what you might be thinking, I'm not actually the rage kind of person. But this is just ridiculous.	1	March 20, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Need to research correct phrases or repeat or change request. Original volume to low. I did not learn on its own that Sirus Sixty on 6 moved to channel 73. Would not connect directly to the channel, had to make another choice another. My google device learned it. If it does not understand it automatically makes its own choice and just starts playing it without asking if I want this choice.	3	November 5, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I wanted a way to listen to music while my family and I cook and clean in kitchen. This product gets the job done, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the sound quality. It's supper muddy on the low end and doesn't have good dynamics at all. Especially when you turn the volume anywhere past the halfway point.Like I said, I don't need much and this gets the job done, but I just really wish it sounded better. It almost seems like I got a refurbished or used one that accidentally made it past quality control.I can't complain though because I got it as part of the 99¬¢ deal for being a first time amazon prime music subscriber. I would never pay full price for this device after hearing the sound quality.	2	February 8, 2022	0

Echo Dot	so i‚Äôve had this for a few months and i‚Äôve honestly loved the echo (bigger one) when i had one. i‚Äôve never had any issues until i bought this one. it is a pain!! if i‚Äôm not home for a few days (i travel often) or even tonight, it has issues connecting to the internet. tonight, i was playing music and using it all day, but now when i asked alexa to set an alarm there were connectivity issues. i‚Äôve called support and all they did was make me reset it, so i do it on my own. then i have to go in the app, delete it and reset it up. it‚Äôs honestly such an inconvenience and a drag. i can‚Äôt even just use it as a bluetooth speaker when this all happens so i‚Äôm forced to go through the whole process again. also consider, i have a roku 6~ ft away from the speaker that never struggles to connect to the internet as well as my laptop/phone, so i‚Äôm pretty annoyed and  i don‚Äôt even want to deal with it anymore.	3	July 21, 2020	1
Echo Dot	I don't honestly use alexa for much. I listen to pandora. It was a gift. Maybe if I took the effort to integrate my house, it could do more for me, but that isn't something I'm looking to do. It can't controll my smart TV. I can do stuff through my phone on alexa, but the things it can do are just easier on my phone than alexa. I have a Facebook portal (also a gift) that does similar things as alexa. Alexa does those things better, but I can't video call with alexa. I don't like how alexa will randomly think you called alexa while playing music or at other times. I don't like how commercials tell alexa to ask things, (like on pandora) and then alexa has to decide if alexa is going to do the things that came from the alexa speaker. The sound quality is pretty good. Not sure if it's better than the portal, though.	3	February 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I can not get radio station 1180 AM this has been a problem . I tried to get help with Amazon,no one can fix my problem. I am very sorry that this is a problem that no one can fix . I am sorry i got this Echo Dot 3I am not happy with your product Thank You R WEYERSBERG	2	June 20, 2022	0
Echo Dot	With how popular these devices are, I‚Äôd expect them to be more simple to use. The device does not always play and must be frequently turned off and back on. Our audiobooks won‚Äôt play and one day it will play a station and the next not be able to find it. Don‚Äôt even get me started on the app.	2	June 23, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I use the 3 Echo Dots to stream music throughout my home.  The Alexa app is easy to download, install, and use on all my devices.  The Eco Dot is simple to set-up through the Alexa app.  I know there are a lot of smart-home, personal scheduling, and other ways to use the Echo Dots, but my home is dumb, my schedule is ""retired"", and I am enjoying streaming music.Two days after I wrote this, I have had trouble with one of the Echo Dots deciding to disconnect itself from the internet and the grouping.  Reading the ""help"" instructions and multiple attempts to reconnect have failed.  I am not sure what to do now, and I don't have a child or teenager to go to for tech advice.Last addition to this review, I promise!  The Echo Dots and Alexa have minds of their own!  One day, everything works well, and the next day I am uninstalling, re-installing, and re-configuring everything. When they work together with Alexa, they are fantastic for music streaming."	3	June 25, 2020	1
Echo Dot	Still doesn‚Äôt hear us half the time but it works decent	3	April 15, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I wasted a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my ECHO device connected to my 5g wifi internet. After some research, some online forums suggested splitting my 5g internet (to 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands) to try to get the ECHO to connected. That did not work either. What a waste of time and money. Amazon needs to provide an update to my ECHO device so that those of us with 5g can connect it. Now I just have a paper weight.	1	October 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	I bought an Amazon Alexa less than 2 years ago, and have suddenly started having volume issues with it. The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day.This started about 2 months ago. I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about. Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another echo device....that I'm now sure will just break down as soon as it's out of warranty.This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue (hardware or software, I'm not sure). But because of a policy shield, I'm screwed over. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could an issue like this be my fault?I expect these devices to last longer than a year and a half........ I'm extremely frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction.Buyer beware. This feels to me that Amazon knows its products will break down as soon as the warranty is up, screwing you over and banking (literally) on the assumption that you'll just continually buy new Alexa devices.	1	June 18, 2020	0
Echo Dot	Great speaker however it does pick up almost every sound made around it. I have to unplug mine when not using it.	3	March 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	"I honestly really like this little thing. I got it in white and it looks very nice. Sometimes (and I mean really not too often at all) she'll mishear something and I'm not too frustrated as I know it happens to others as well. I dont have any complaints about the audio quality but I also didn't purchase this to fill my whole entire house with music. It does fill up an entire room though and that's enough for me when I'm relaxing at home. I do have one complaint and it's the only reason I am giving 3 stars. I'm not sure if I received a faulty product but whenever I ""drop in"" with my boyfriend he'll be trying to talk to me and when I answer, he says he can barely hear me. This is so strange to me because I can hear him just fine and Alexa responds to me even when I'm across the room, but for me to be directly over the Alexa Dot and for him to tell me that with his volume all the way up he can still barely hear me tells me that maybe something's wrong with mine? I'm not sure exactly and it's really strange to me. Also slightly disappointed about that. Other than that, I really like this dot."	3	September 9, 2019	1
Echo Dot	It's totally fine for what it is. Speaker could be better, but I just don't really have a need for Alexa in my life. She is better suited with someone else. No offense Alexa, I do wish for your happiness as well.	2	July 25, 2022	0
Echo Dot	Pretty cool! I‚Äôd love to keep using but I can‚Äôt connect YouTube music to it. So, I‚Äôm giving it to my gf and sticking with google nest. If you use anything besides YouTube music though this would be a cool addition	3	December 30, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I took advantage of Prime Day to order this Dot speaker for $19.99.  I figured it would be worth it to try out Alexa without the expense of a pricier 4th generation version, especially because reviews have been so poor for the more expensive 4th gen Echo.  I'm disappointed because my Mom's cylindrical Echo speaker (I bought it for her in May 2020 and think it may have been 2nd gen) has such clear sound.  So we do use this speaker when we want to listen to some music while doing household chores.  But I hope the next generation Echo speakers have better, more clear surround-sound quality and not the directional sound that's garnering so many poor reviews for the 4th-gen speakers.	3	July 4, 2021	1
Echo Dot	"For the $20 that I paid, it was a worthy purchase. Don't expect high quality sound, thumping base or adequate volume as you won't find it in the Dot 3rd Generation. It's adequate for use in a ""small"" bedroom, nothing larger."	3	December 28, 2021	1
Echo Dot	I bought two so I could do multi room music..  won't work. Bought ridiculously expensive lightbulbs.. won't  stay synced. Never can find them. What a waste. Overpriced alaem clocks.	2	August 13, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"I was excited, at my age, and looking forward to having a partial smart home.  I ordered the Echo Dot 3 gen (which I love even now) and two smart plugs to control two lamps...one in the bedroom and one by the front door.  The dot worked perfectly, plug it in and Alexa is ""in the house.""  The smart plugs would connect to the home network but no matter what we (Amazon Tech and myself) tried, the plugs would not react to the ""off/on"" commands.  The software would find the smart plug, install the drivers or whatever, but no reaction.  I was disappointed with the smart plugs only.  Please do not let my experience interfere with moving up a notch in the ""Smart Universe.""  This is probably an isolated incident and a possible something I overlooked in my network.  On top of it all, I lost my patience!  I wanted it to work out of the box.  I returned the entire package with reluctance.  Amazon is a great company for me.  I have never ever had to return anything before.  I personally realize there is no way back from the ""Smart Universe.""  By the way, the return was flawless."	3	October 28, 2019	1

Echo Dot	The speaker and sound quality aren't the best but works fine. I guess has more bass so when volume up, I feel like the speaker going blow. However, this is not the case why I only gave 2 stars. The reasons, I gave 2 stars because it is not safe to use. What I mean is that, if you have kids or someone who doesn't listen will use this echo dot to order stuffs and subscribed (music, movie  and etc.) to any paid that Amazon offers therefore before you know you have charged for stuffs that you didn't purchased or subscribed. There's no way to control it and can always be reset by anyone using.My kids were playing with and asking (jokes, music, and etc.) questions. After a week, I noticed that they subscribed to Amazon music which I didn't allow or authorized to do so. I also noticed that, they reset the echo dot and even though it is not reset anyone can control over just by talking to the echo dot. This echo dot can order and check on your orders which no privacy. There's no way to control this device. If you buying this echo dot to use as speaker then it fine but remember anyone using this device can access to your Amazon information.	2	May 9, 2021	0
Echo Dot	"Being that the Echo Dot is just a tiny speaker, relatively speaking, I didn't expect much from this device. However, we have 5 Dots in the house now and two of the five have just been nearly useless when it comes to two-way communication (Drop in feature). Given that the major reason we purchased these were for the drop in function, it leaves a lot to be desired. Of course, the sound didn't start to go bad until after the ""support window"" had expired so we're stuck with a bad device. Thankfully they are cheap, but don't expect to get a whole lot for your money. I don't know if there are any good alternatives, but I'll be looking to buy something higher quality than the Dots. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who wants decent sound quality."	3	June 6, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I have two DOTS and I have thought about scaling back to one, because the one in the distant room often responds before the one that is only 6' away from me does. One is in my Master and one is in my Kitchen (35' apart with two walls separating them). These units do not communicate with each other nor do they apparently understand that both should not answer a request at nearly the same time.I am thinking about finding a way to set the sensitivity if it is available, but if not, I will have to shut one down. Not terribly impressed with the technology and I HATE the MUSIC Catalog. I have the paid subscription, but only get Live versions, or duets on many of my favorite songs and I HATE live Versions or Covers and have NO ABILITY to set preferences or verbally get it to stop these things. I thought it was cool at first, but it is wearing off quickly after a year of these limitations.	3	September 21, 2020	1

Echo Dot	"We bought the ""ball"" echo dot but despite buying a new router could not connect it. Amazon wanted to remote into my computer to assist, despite claims they'd never make such a request. We returned it and Amazon worked with us to get the ""hockey puck"" dot for a good price. It connected in about 30 seconds making me realize the first dot was defective. So far, we're still learning its positives & negatives. Sound leaves a lot to be desired but I can't complain too much for a $20 robot. Trying to get it to play specific episodes of podcasts is difficult and we're trying to learn how to speak to Alexis."	3	July 20, 2021	1

Echo Dot	I bought this one to connect to my nest camera after researching that it can be connected. I was able to connect my Nest camera but realized that Alexa will not send alerts and notifications from Nest, which was a bummer.

Echo Dot	This device was working just fine and now it's been about a year and I'm having issues, she is not speaking up with my reminders or timers.I understand it's 2018 version, but if it's only going to last a year don't bother selling it.Ugggggg	3	December 11, 2021	1
Echo Dot	this device is kind of lost on me. I don't really use it and as far as I know I have never played music on it. It seems to pick up sounds from the TV. One day I noticed a charge on my CC bill for $7.99 for Amazon Music, which surprised me since I didn't order it, have belonged to Prime for years, and usually listen to You Tube music videos anyway. But apparently Alexa deviously signed me up for a subscription I didn't even know I had. Luckily I check my bill. The same thing happened to a friend of mine.  This is a very devious way to line the pockets of Mr. Besos.  Imagine if they do that to every one who has one of these devices, and maybe 10% never even notice. Eight dollars a month times a million unknowing victims is a lot of money for nothing!	3	February 3, 2021	1
Echo Dot	They didn't have any Jamaican or Rasta voices	3	April 8, 2022	1
Echo Dot	I have newer Alexa's but I ordered this one because it was on sale and wanted one in my kitchen. This one lags like crazy. When I use the wake up word I have to wait a long time for the light to turn on so I know it is listening. Due to that lag sometimes it misses my command all together. I do not recommend this generation one.	2	June 8, 2022	0
Echo Dot	"Having issues with voice recognition. Purchased 2 additional sets of smart light bulbs that are Alexa compatible. Found that using numbers to dimlights works best. Example ; Alexa dim light to 25%. .... We currently have 2 Alexa units in use. Microphone is a probable issue for the voice issue but I'm still experimenting with placement as a remedy. Example; One unit is on the floor in the hallway. A possible solution to the problem may be mounting on a wall. Also there is an issue when 2 units are in use. I have a intermittent problem when say one unit is playing music and the other is off. When I say Alexa play music everywhere the second unit will change the station I was enjoying. Like and technology this thing is mostly good but still has some bugs. The Alexa guard feature is basically worthless. It will only detect breaking glass to send to an alert. I've had maintenance people and myself inside the home when the guard feature is activated..... no alerts. So don't get a false sense of security if you rely on this a a burglar alarm. Overall the Alexa is like a ""clapper"" on steroids. A clapper is a switch from long ago that when you clapped your hands lights would go on and off. So basically this echo thing is a lot more than that. To make lights and appliances work you must have a smart plug of light. Lights can be purchased for about 12$ each. The light feature is nice as Alexa can change the light color. Alexa does get a passing grade but still not going to be 100% with the current generation."	2	January 16, 2020	0
Echo Dot	This product is the worst.  It simply does not work.  I have to leave a review because it has absolutely driven me mad trying to link it, trying to get it to play my Apple music, trying to get it to do the simplest things that its own instruction book tells you it should do.  So tired of Alexa telling me I don't know how to do that when it is as simple request as to turn on the newly purchased Smart TV that came with the very Echo Dot, all of which was paired multiple times.  Then, there's the Apple music pairing issue where on some days it works and on others not so much.  Prepare yourself pls.  You will go crazy trying to pair it and to figure out why in the Alexa app it shows everything as paired but there is Alexa telling you that you still have to pair it.  Over and over again you will lose sanity trying to get it to simply play a song right in front of you.  No way to override the madness and to shove the damn song down Alexa's throat so she will spit it back out at you to inevitably play the one song right there on the app.  And then there is the issue of telling Alexa to play an album only to have her play one song from the album instead of the entire thing an what seems to be a concerted effort to only play Amazon music.My advice whether this Echo Dot was free or $100 or $20 - don't do it.  Don't buy it.  Save your sanity.  Save your precious time that will be invested in fixing all the problems that will arise and suck you in so you can get this DUMB PIECE OF EQUIPMENT to work correctly.Horrible piece of crap doesn't really do it justice.  If it was free to me, I'd take a hammer to it.  That, truly, would give me joy right after Alexa tells me she doesn't know how to do something she's done a million times over.  THE HAMMER AND A QUICK BURIAL WITH THE BROOM AND A TRASH CAN.  That only would bring peace to this generation of Echo Dot.	1	December 15, 2019	0
