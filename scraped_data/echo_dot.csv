Echo Dot	Really handy and fun	I didn’t think I would use the echo as much as I do. I really enjoy asking Alexa all kinds of questions including weather, history, jokes, etc. She tells me etas & when my packages have arrived. She sends me reminders to do things. In the morning I get a whole good morning message LOL. I tell Alexa to play radio stations for me & almost anything you can think of including turning on TV, running my irobot, etc. This echo can do so much for a little speaker. If you’re considering trying one, do it just buy it	5.0 out of 5 stars	October 6, 2022	Shookone	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFV5T47KJGERF66R4ONG7NHQE67A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True

Echo Dot	No one is too old	I purchased this for my recently widowed 85-year old mother.
