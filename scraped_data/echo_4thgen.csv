Echo 4th Gen	I wish we never purchased this I hate the alexa! It never works! You ask it to simply turn on the fire stick and nothing happens. I don't know if it's the Alexa or the fire stick but every single day I have to go and unplug my fire stick at least two to three times to get it to turn on. It never understands what you're saying. When you let it know that it's not working it doesn't try to fix. It's horrible they need to fix it. When I got Alexa back when it first came out she would answer all these questions she was fun now she hardly knows anything I don't know what they did to her but they made her very stupid.	1	October 25, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"Cons: it cannot Cast audio from my phone, does not work with Spotify app, Alexa app is incomprehensible, it shouts ""Now commented to XYZ!"" every time it connects to a device, it keeps flashing colors all day and night with no clear way to stop it, and setting up home theater pairing is bizarrely overcomplicated in the app.Pros: It pairs with the Fire Stick for a home theater setup and works perfectly. Alexa voice recognition is great. Audio quality is great."	2	October 25, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Love this Echo. It is bigger than expected but it works great in our living room space. We have it so the kids are able to listen to music while they play games. I am able to set timers easily and the ease of allowing my kids to talk to Alexa is great. The only negative is there is no time display on this echo. It was easy to set up (as I have other Alexas/Echo) but other than that it was easy to install and set up. Had it playing my music within 3 mins of plugging it in.	4	October 25, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	First off I would give this premium sound echo 5 stars except the first one worked about 10 min before dying. Had to call Amazon on a Friday to arrange for return which was painless but….. The replacement arrived on Monday. The new echo premium sound really does kick. We also bought the battery stand so we could take it outside. This new combo is so great, just hope it lasts as long as our earlier versions.	4	October 25, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Hubiera dado mejor puntuación si hubiera podido comprarlo en Amazon.  Aún siendo un producto de ustedes, para Puerto Rico nunca estuvo disponible para comprar y tuve que comprarlo en BestBuy.	4	October 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"This is my second unit. The size is larger than ""a dot"". But, it also gives a richer bass sound than my other cylindrical shaped unit. When I set it up, it recognized the other unit in my home and designated itself #2. There are only 4 buttons imprinted onto the cover, + and- volume, turn on/ microphone and a third button that I don't yet know all's it's capabilities. The unit is in my basement workshop, which can be dusty. This is an issue since the entire cover is a black foam material which will hold dust. So, when I leave, I cover it with a small piece of plastic. The price was right, so I am happy with the system"	5	October 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I live with this device everyday.  Was way better than I expected.  My friend came in and heard it and took it he liked it so much so I had to buy another one for me.  The sound quality is better than my bose unit.	5	October 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	1-year update and I have to say that this product is very inconsistent.  I mostly use this for listening to music.  Some days it will play perfect for hours.  Then the next day I can't get it to play a whole song without cutting out.  Unplug, restart, and it does it more.  Then Alexa doesn't respond correctly to audio commands.  I'm just about done with this junk.  It's an audio speaker and it can barely do that on it's best day.  Pair the subwoofer with it and multiply your headaches!!!  Sometimes it works, other times it don't... and then on the rare occasion, the SUBWOOFER will play music when the speaker won't.  VERY annoying!!!	1	October 24, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	It's a great upgrade from the echo	5	October 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I Love this device! I was skeptical it would be helpful.  I got a deal on smart plugs and paired it with the Alexa Orb🤣 now we love playing music, cutting on lights throughout house, televisions, fans. We are old and not techy so this was a stretch for us. It’s SO easy to set-up and so useful I don’t know why I waited so long or how I got along without it. You will NOT be sorry you purchased. Buy smart plugs to to add to all your outlets. Cut on lights before you get home. LOVE it!	5	October 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Alexa works fine as just alexa, but it won't integrate with my Smart TV.	4	October 24, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded my old Amazon Echo to the new Echo, 4th generation.  I love the new design, choice of colors, and the ease of setting it up.  The sound quality is much improved, it is so good.  I'm glad I upgraded!	5	October 24, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	It works great as a simple Echo Dot, when it becomes to usability of the speaker capabilities it becomes almost impossible to use it, it change the volume by itself constantly, it keeps disconnecting, I contacted Amazon support and I spent an hour trying to solve the issues with no success, I need to highlight, the support team where very kind and they really tried to help.	2	October 24, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	Very helpful with my questions, information on current situations. Has a answer for everything question.	5	October 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The learning curve for me was learning how to talk correctly to Alexa to achieve expected results is ongoing.  You speak correctly = you get your results, but until you say it the way Alexa will recognise it = frustration.  However, all in all, yes I would recommend and if gifting,  make sure the person receiving has a lot of patience.  I do see the benifits associated with having an Echo once the learning curve has been navigated.  Hope this helps someone.	5	October 23, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I bought this Echo device for my living room/kitchen and did not want to bother with external speakers (line out or Bluetooth).  This echo sounds so good my wife thought that I had connected it to our 2.1 speakers.Got it on sale, and well worth the price.	5	October 23, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Nice clear sound	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Maybe Amazon does it on purpose.  Bought the original Echo Plus years ago and, boy, did it get used in this family of nine.  Daughter mentioned it was finally showing its age (like me) so I got the newer one, plugged it in and that was it.  I plugged it in.  It automatically connected to Wifi and our Prime account and found all the other devices and kind of shooed me away when I was waiting to see what would happen.  Same with smart plugs.  Had an old Wemo and plugged it in and ran into all kinds of problems and instructions just to get it working with the Wemo app much less Alexa.  Swapped the Wemo plug with an Amazon plug and that's all it took.  Immediately showed up in my Alexa app.Yep.They're doing it on purpose.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The size is ok.  The sound is very good for the size.	5	October 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I found it difficult (during setup) to introduce this device (Echo Dot, 4th generation) to the three other ""dots"" (earlier version) for communicating ... I could ""drop in"" to the other dots (earlier version ""hockey pucks""), however, they (""bedroom, family room, garage, etc.) COULD NOT drop-in to Dot, 4the generation.  Technical help by phone resolved the issue, but I could not find any direction on how to fix this problem with any (text) documents and/or information on-line. Thanks to Emman F for his assistance."	3	October 22, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Bought this gem on Prime Day at a discount.  Even at full price this is worth it.  Great sound for such a small system.  Looking forward to integrating with the subwoofer.	5	October 22, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	If you connect a device to the Echo for bluetooth it YELLS at you when you open anything that uses audio and it has heard anything for 10 minutes.  It is LOUD and there is NO WAY to turn it off.  This has been the same for years and they refuse to fix it.  So if you want to use this for bluetooth, you'll be wasting your money.  They Amazon programmers are apparently not smart enough to add this much desired feature of telling her to STOP YELLING AT ME.	1	October 21, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	The speaker sound is horrible. It sounds muffled, unclear and there are no sound adjustment controls for the speaker. .  Unbelievably, my 1ST GEN Alexa has great sound. I wish I could buy another.	3	October 21, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I bought two of these and connected them to my 4k Firestick for a home theater experience. They work and sound great! They are also great for playing Amazon music in stereo when you have 2.	5	October 20, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Super cool. It's like having a live in assistant. Love love love	5	October 20, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this to replace an existing Echo solely for its ZigBee hub functionality.  I added 3 Zigbee light switches.  Adding was simple.  A few days later none of my light switches will respond to Alexa.  Unplugging the Echo Plus and plugging it back in gets the ZigBee light switches to reconnect but only temporarily.	1	October 19, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is wonderful, Alexa understands from far away what I'm saying. I now own 3 of these for all over the house. Always catch them on sale.	5	October 19, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Very easy setup. Had an issue connecting one echo and they quickly sent a new one overnight. Works perfectly. The only issue I have is with Amazon music integration. Very unclear how to pair Amazon music with echo atleast for me it’s not working	5	October 19, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I was looking for a great sounding Echo and this fits my needs.  I couldn't afford the Studio so this was next after my research. What a great sound this has! Made a list of songs to test sound including my rock, classical, John Williams, Enya..all different depths of music. This Echo is a great product.  Highly recommended.	5	October 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Me agrado todo	5	October 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I will start off on a good note:  The sound is so much better than the previous generations.  However....As you can see there are two devices in the photo.  The one on the right is the original purchased, the one of the left was the used one I was sent to replace the one I am having problems with.  Clearly the replacement one was used, it has a small faded stain on it.  The issues I am experiencing involves the voice recognition.  I can say its name and it does not respond, sometimes I will have to raised my voice to a yell for it to hear me which does not work well when others are sleeping.  Other times, my older generation device in my bedroom responds and there is a wall between me and it.  I am sitting aprx 8-10 ft away from the device and it does not hear!  Sometimes when I ask it for my notifications, the one in the bedroom answers me thru the wall which of course I can't hear the notification!  They are going to send me a third one, due to the fact the replacement one I received was used.  Hopefully, the third time is the charm!  Aside from the issues with this particular device, I have always loved my Echo Dots.	3	October 17, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	An intetesting improvement would be to add an additional set of Alexa response lights on top of the unit. This is not a complaint, just an observation.	5	October 17, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I've never liked Alexa, never registers any commands, if you want to listen to good music it just asks for subscriptions. Tried to pair a phone and it wouldn't pair. I e owned this since it came out. Finally stressed me out so much into the trash it went!	1	October 16, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	When Amazon allowed grouping and pairing, we went crazy with Gen 3 Echoes through our whole house. We love them. So we decided to finally try the newest version in our kitchen. Overall, still great. But not as good as generation 3 units. First, don't worry about the directional speaker if you put these against a wall already. It still fills the room with sound. But here's what isn't as good: voice activation doesn't seem as tight as gen 3. I'm a composer and sound guy and while the low might be a bit better here over gen 3 but the rest of the sound just isn't as full as as the previous version. Gen3 is just a richer sound. Finally, and something I didn't see coming, the new shape. People can debate if they like it or not, but having it out for just a few days, and because the whole top is speaker mesh, you get finger prints from the buttons and dust and other air-gunk gets stuck on it and it can't be wiped away because, well, it's speaker mesh. This is going to be a big deal over time as this isn't going to look good in a year from now, where gen 3 could just be wiped off. I hope the next version abandons this current globe design, simply for this reason.	4	October 14, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Bigger than 3rd gen echo, but good sound quality.  Connected easily to my Alexa network.  BUT, I cannot understand why they paired a black echo with a white power cord.  Was this a mistake, because it looks as if I am using the wrong cord.  Cannot use power cords for previous versions of Alexa/Echos.  Small, but extremely irritating issue.	3	October 13, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I had an old 1st generation Amazon Speaker that wreaked havoc throughout the house (with the wife) trying to connect to a new wi-fi network. After hours/2days of frustration and feelings of failure, I contacted Customer Service whom in turn tried everything I'd been through already. I accepted defeat and the Customer Service Rep advised me to utilize the TRADE-IN on Amazon and UPGRADE. I received 25% off PLUS $25 gift card towards my new and MUCH IMPROVED Amazon Device. Needless to say, I'm overjoyed with the upgrade however, I remain pretty much in trouble with the wife :-)	5	October 13, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	There have been times when it has been unreponsive...I've needed to do a hard reset before it will again function.It's louder than the Dot...but I find I want a unit with more volume to it.	4	October 12, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought an entire Alexa speaker set-up (two echos, a sub, and an echo link) thinking I would use it as a home theater for both my TV and record player. It's an absolute nightmare to use. The speakers never connect correctly via wifi, the volume levels for the TV are too low, playing a record through the link works about 50% of the time. Unfortunately, I waited too long to return but I'll be selling these and buying a Sonos system.	1	October 11, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I own 4 total devices and different generations.  Overall, Alexa works well until you to try to play music.  I have a playlist with at 300 artists in it; when I ask Alexa to shuffle that playlist, it hasn't chosen a new artist in over a year, and rarely a different song from that artist.I once shuffled 3x in a row and got the exact same song order all 3 times.  I am a premium amazon music subscriber, so it's very disappointing.	1	October 11, 2022	0

So why won't it connect to my everywhere group,why does it turn to "" offline"" when I try to create a group ,but it's playing music? The whole idea is to have it play along with my other devices.Frustrating!"	4	October 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	i bought for a friend she loves it	5	October 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Great sound. We bought one in white and one in charcoal to match things in our kitchen. Was surprised that the cord for the Alexa in charcoal is white. It should definitely be black. Notice in the ads where you show photos of all of them, that the white one is shown with the white cord and so is the twilight blue but the Charcoal 4th Gen Alexa is not shown with a cord at all, leaving the impression that the cord would certainly be black. Definitely do NOT like the white cord with the Charcoal Alexa. Wrong place to skimp - a bit deceiving.	4	October 11, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Years ago, I started with the Echo Dots.  The little hockey pucks.  Not used for music but for a virtual assistant, controlling smart lighting and also controlling my TV's Firestick that tunes over-the-air television through my Recast.  I loved it.  But then I got an Echo Show for the kitchen and I really enjoyed playing music on it while cooking.  The sound quality was ok.  Nothing to brag about.  Then I decided to upgrade my hockey pucks to the newer full size Echos.  I bought two Echos and placed one in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I would play music through them and the sound quality was very surprising.  So then I decided to get one more for the back porch.  That evolved into wanting another for the porch that I could pair to the other.That's when everything changed for me!  When you pair two of them together and set it up as a stereo pair; it is really amazing.  I sit outside now and I listen to music (in stereo!) on the porch.  The bass can be felt in my chair.  I'm so impressed.  I have 5 acres and with the volume turned up to 7, I can hear the music just about anywhere on my property.I plan on getting more Echos and enhancing the music when I listen to it inside the house.  I have the Bose 700 Soundbar and Subwoofer in my living room.  It sounds great for movies, TV and music.  But I prefer the Echos when listening to music.  Its perfect.  I can have Echos placed around the house and have music playing softly and you can hear it everywhere.I'm very impressed.	5	October 10, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	A este equipo si pudiera solo le diera 3.5 estrellas, pero esto no se puede.Este producto como pongo mas arriba esta rosando la perfección, pero... tiene un problema muy desagradable y es el siguiente, me he pedido dos echo 4ta para crear un cine en casa junto a un Fire TV 4K HDR, sucede lo siguiente: la calidad de audio directamente pedido a las bocinas via alexa es superior por mucho al audio que se reproduce desde el fire tv sincronizado con los echo 4ta, la musica suena hermosa, suena perfecta desde alexa, pero cuando veo una pelicula debo subir el volumen al maximo para apenas escuchar. sucede lo mismo si reproduzco musica en la app nativa de amazon music en el fire tv, el audio se siente de menor calidad a la que me ofrece cuando lo pido directo al asistente y tambien se siente que suena  menos.Estoy mas que satisfecho con la calidad de audio de estas bocinas cuando escucho musica desde Alexa, voy a comprar el echo sub de todos modos y esperemos que en futuras actualizaciones Amazon solucione este problema.	4	October 10, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I recently replaced an older Gen 1 (I think) Alexa on our back patio. The difference in the sound amazing.

Echo 4th Gen	The main reason I bought this was for my husband. My husband has a hard time hearing when we use the TV built-in speakers especially when the show has music that is so loud it drowns out the voices. I hooked it up paired it through the Alexa app, and changed the preferred speakers to Echo, and still, the TV sound would not come out of the Echo. I called support and after she put me on hold several times, she came back and had me blue-tooth the Echo to the TV through the Settings menu. After that, the sound did come out of the Echo, but the sound quality is so quiet I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it, which made it still not as loud as the TV speakers. With the volume all the way up, Alexa is extremely loud. I called tech support again to ask if there is a way to turn down just Alexa's voice so it is not booming. There is not. One more note...Echo Alexa does not always understand commands. You have to say, Alexa, turn on FireTV...because if you say Turn on the TV, it just says that feature is not available...or something to that effect. Pretty awful. Returning it.	1	October 8, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	For whatever reason, this 4th gen can’t understand commands like my 3rd and 2nd gen Echoes. It’s almost worthless	2	October 8, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	The speaker quality is good but, the music intergaration is horrible you can't play the songs you want only from Spotify or Amazon, I use YouTube music so this product is useless to me, and I hate Spotify playlist	1	October 8, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Very easy to install and get it up and working. Love the ability to turn lights on and off just by speaking. Ready to integrate more household items with Alexa. Clear speaking voice.  I haven't found anything, so far, that Alexa cannot answer!	5	October 8, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	This is our 3rd and worst Echo. Hasn’t heard voice commands on several occasions!	3	October 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I have a number of Echo ""dots"" but just the one large Echo. The sound quality of the dots is not really bad, but the sound quality of the large Echo is superior to the dots. Therefore, the large Echo is in the place where I play music most often (pretty much all day, most days). One of the dots is attached through the headphone jack to my stereo amplifier, that provides excellent sound in the downstairs and allows quick access to Alexa."	5	October 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	can't notice the bottom ring. It takes up way too much room in width. really ugly too.	3	October 7, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Alexa is great but she responds to my TV which is somewhat annoying.	4	October 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I would like Alexa to pair with more electronics and work as a Bluetooth speaker when the internet is out.	4	October 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Bought this to replace my old Echo Dot.  The sound is richer and it is not too large to be obtrusive on my desk.  Deducted a couple of stars as it fails in the same place that my other Echo devices do, speech recognition and command execution.  I am a fan of the Echo/Alexa platform, and I expect it to improve, but as of now, it just isn’t as good as I want it to be.  Expect to spend a fair amount of time arguing with the device (trust me you will never win), and reviewing your voice history.  Keep the software up to date always as updates do bring improvements, although sometimes they seem to break things as well.  Seems we are all beta testers.	3	October 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Voice recognition is so poor, my little echo dot picks up the commands before this device and is in another room!	2	October 7, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Of course does Alexa well that’s a given.Sound quality is good pushing very good and almost impressive.  Amazon will be completing with the popular quality speakers soon.  In fact i will be adding the echo studio into the group.  If i had to buy again i would only get the studio.Easy to group two speakers but trying to figure out how to group multiple speakers or group as I decided to go all in on Amazon to build out my integrated sound system throughout the house including surround via the firestick .  Not sure this is the best plan but it is the most affordable and keeps the smart devices consistent to one brand for easy up keep .	5	October 7, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	"My original 1st Gen Alexa finally died after nearly 8 years. So traded in for this Echo 4th Gen. It is more expensive than the dots and supposedly better sound quality. But don't believe it; mine sucks. Sound is poor and muffled. When it plays music, music can barely be heard. When Echo is speaking, it is LOUD. Also, voice-recognition sucks. ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" Alexa: ""It is 7:04pm now."" And that is when it actually hears me (I have to SHOUT). After four generations, Amazon devices have gotten worse, not better. If you have to buy, stick with the dots."	2	October 5, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Much better sound quality than the “puck.” This has replaced our radio and stereo and works great.	5	October 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought my first echo3 on a deal and loved the functions it did to ease my life. It's the little things to turn on off lights, ask time and temp, play music, and most of all to read a book for me from my Amazon library. When echo4 had a deal I got it with lights for my granddaughter for music as it said improved speakers. That will be her birthday gift. I noticed then the newer echo4 with hub control for sale and upgraded. I put the older one in my kitchen as it still works great. I haven't a home full of Alexa enabled apps but I thought why not for a better quality sound. I haven't gone into the hub or ultrasound abilities yet but the sleep sounds I listen too at night is far improved. I like the look too. I did blue to keep them figured out if I get more for another room later. So far the only irritating thing is I have to repeat myself for Alexa to start playing something but it did that with echo3. I'm assuming it's the not perfect part of technology of humans. It improves each generation mayhap. Worth buy.	4	October 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I use Alexa slotWorks greatGood sound	5	October 5, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I absolutely love this and use it every day	5	October 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I'm very pleased (low key obsessed) with this speaker. The sound quality is really good, especially for the price. I'm pleased to see the price went further down, almost seems irresponsible not to buy a whole bunch of them now. They love to work in tandem. One of them stopped listening to my commands at one point- Amazon replaced it with a new one no questions asked. I still haven't returned it, but they haven't really bothered me about it. It's still hooked up as a satellite speaker, but I think the Mic went out on it. Either way, I love it. I'm gonna buy a whole bunch more...	5	October 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Absolutely never works properly. Can’t even pair to other Amazon devices. Just not made well.	1	October 5, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Better performance than what I expected. I love this one from amazon.	5	October 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is on par with the best small WiFi or Bluetooth speakers. The voice and alex recognition is accurate. It look amazing with the decor. My advice is wait until prime day for best deal. You want be disappointed!	4	October 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The sound is great, it has a great design, love the way it looks.	5	October 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I use it outdoors but protected from the weather.  It has a nice clear sound and good volume.  Works well for connecting to a projector for outside movies too.	5	October 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I exchanged a few old alexa devices for this one and paid a little extra for the sound. I'm honestly underwhelmed having hoped for more. I have alexa throughout my home and this didn't seem superior to the regular echo's or dot's I already have.	3	October 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I like it's output and sturdiness.	5	October 4, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I was looking for a soundbar system for my livingroom. While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick. My Echo Sub arrived today, and I'm REALLY looking forward to trying that out.	4	October 3, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	These Echos worked well	4	October 3, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	One for my living room and one for the bathroom. Sound quality is great can’t complain as it’s good for any genre of music. I like the amazon music integration too.	5	October 3, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I have several Echo devices, and mostly like them all. This newest one is the most responsive to voice commands, from both of us.	5	October 3, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I was a bit surprised at sound quality.	5	October 3, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I used to love these devices, but in the last year she's always adding at the end of every command i give her ""by the way ..."". I don't want to here her suggestions or tips or anything. I just want her to do what I asked her to do. I have followed every suggestion I can find on the internet and nothing works. Just tonight she was telling me she can get me ready for the rings of power. Amazon should not be advertising their things in my home like that. They should leave it on their Fire TV and website. I don't need to hear about it when I want to turn my lights off or set a timer. Never buying another amazon smart home device."	1	October 3, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I love everything	5	October 3, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I think amazon should just recall this device. Worst Alexa device ever. You have to call it 5 times before it even responds. Embarrassing for such a company. First gen echo dot is 100 times better. Sound is just louder but not better. Don’t waste your money. You will regret buying this product even on amazon day and at discounted price.	1	October 3, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	The sound is incredible.  Easy to pair.	5	October 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I had a first generation Echo that I exchanged to get this new echo. To my disappointment this one doesn’t listen well AT ALL. The sound quality it top notch, but her voice recognition and listening is terribly sub par.I’ve used it in 3 different spaces and that has made little difference. The only time she responds consistently is when I’m within 4 feet or really yell.In fact, my two echo dots ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE respond more consistently to me than this one does. I was literally 10 feet away from this echo and asked it to set a timer and both of my other echos (which have walls and hallways between me and them) responded to me and the one that had a clear line of sight and sound, didn’t even engage.If you’re looking for excellent sound, this will get the job done. If you’re looking for another child that doesn’t listen and often misunderstands what you said, this will also get the job done.I’d get the smaller echo dot clock before I’d get this, if my mom or grandma were to ask my opinion.	1	October 2, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Great product. It’s very fancy and smart. It’s worth every penny. It’s the center of my smart home. The sound is amazing.	5	October 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Great price , very impressed with the sound quality.	5	October 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The new 4th Generation Alexa had gone down in capabilities. The microphone is incapable of understanding your voice no matter how close you are to it. It's almost like she's lost half her IQ points. Keep your earlier generation! I've had to go back to using Siri. He's definitely the better answer here, but he doesn't often provide a verbal answer, but gives you links to them.	1	October 1, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I'm an audiophile, but after a while even I long for the conveneience of 1-click settings. Enter Prime Deals and savings and I can't resist trying out the Echo 4th gen speaker in my bedroom.No, its not the same as my Sony 5.1 Stereo with live mic speaker balance testing. By the same token, I can carry it in one hand, talk (back) to it, and best of all, the sound quality is, especially for such a small (relativey) inexpensive speaker, absolutely EXCELLENT, and I say so without any hesitation.If you can, wait for a sale, but either way, if you want excellent sound the easy way, this is the way to go!	5	October 1, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	See above	5	September 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I was hoping that Alexa would integrate with my other home applications such as water heaters,  pool equipment etc and apparently this isn’t possible without some other equipment.  Alexa does integrate with the Ring doorbell security system as well as my TV.	4	September 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Sound is quite good given its size. Plenty good for my office. I also have an Alexa Studio and THAT device is peerless and unmatched by any other. If you buy this, chances are you will be happy.	5	September 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	These little speakers really sound great.	5	September 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The voice recognition isn’t the best. Has good sound quality for its size though.	4	September 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	when music is playing and you want Alexa to do something else it will sometimes not hear you at all. its like the echo has hearing loss whenever music is playing but as soon as music isnt playing it will head me say alexa from a different room.	5	September 29, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"from the echo dot! Very happy with this unit. My main voice recognition complaint is she can't tell a squawking parrot from a dog, and when I am upstairs with the dog, resting silently, I'll get fone notices saying that the dog is barking, and would I like to drop in downstairs?  I've then asked her if she is guarding my house and she isn't. So no clue why I get constant notices! Now I won't believe her when she is guarding! I do like a new feature. With the loud parrots, I would call her name and she would flash her light, make an negative sound and stop responding. Yes, I have cussed at the AI when she didn't recognize my voice, and that is her default reaction to a cuss! But now, when I'm yelling across the room and the parrots then yell over me, instead if an AI version of a certain rude gesture, with light and sound and refusing to continue, she has learned manners. She politely says ""I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Could you repeat that?"". Much nicer. Again, the sound is way better than a single or pair of dots. More projection in  different directions. Works nicely with the music subscription. Like it so much, I'm considering rolling the dice on the $200 unit on Black Friday, to use in living room and putting this in my bedroom."	5	September 29, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I was hoping this could be a cheaper solution for respectable surround sound for my house but the truth is that these are absolutely not the quality anyone would expect who is really looking to replace a sound system for easy plug n play wifi connected speakers. Yes they work, yes it is easy, NO these are not premium sound. Maybe they are premium in contrast to other echo devices but not comparable to other sound systems.You absolutely get what you pay for in this case…Cheap stuff yields cheap results.	2	September 28, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	So far I love the way this newer echo sounds compared to my original echo that I traded in. I'll admit that sometimes I do think that my older echo sounded better but it's probably just me missing the old look. This newer echo I think is trying too hard to look like an apple devices. I do love that this echo comes with a temperature sensor for detecting the room temperature although I do agree with other reviewers that it's not very accurate. Overall it does what it's supposed to do well even if the look leaves something to be desired.	5	September 28, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	It does what it is supposed to do as far as be an Alexa speaker.  The sound is lackluster and lacks any punch	3	September 28, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Great product. Exceptional sound for its size. One suggestion, don’t place it too close to a security system glass breakage sensor. The base will set it off. Turn down the volume, move it or the sensor.	5	September 28, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I had the first generation for years and I loved it. A few months ago it started to shut off for no reason and I knew it was time for and upgrade. As soon as I hooked it up and played the very first song I was blown away by the sound! I love that you can adjust the levels in the Alexa app and she speaks much faster than the 1st generation. This unit is awesome and the color is pretty too. Great job Amazon 👏	5	September 25, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have owned several Amazon echos but this is the best one yet. I gave the sound quality a 5 and it is good when compared to other Amazon devices and general listening. Doesn’t replace your high quality stereo but it is a great product and works easily. Also setup was a breeze!	5	September 25, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	The sound from the Dot to this is night and day.  I still like my Dot in the bathrooms and have one connected to my Sound System in my bar. But, this baby I take on the deck with me ! The bass is nice and warm. It’s not a blaster, but the sound quality is there. I don’t crank it all the way up out of respect to my neighbors.	5	September 24, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Works fine!	5	September 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The voice recognition really isn't very good on this. Alexa uses terminology when she speaks but when you ask about the same terminology she doesn't understand. The sound is okay for one speaker. Our Echo started playing intermittent static really loud during music. Also we kept getting Amazon ads that could not be turned off. Even customers service could not figure it out.	1	September 24, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Hi	4	September 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Mostly just turning lights on and off now. Radio works well and sounds very nice. Still learning how else Alexa can help around the house. An issue to us is the placement of Alexa. It is now in our bedroom to allow voice control of our bedroom lights. It has to be in our bedroom to accomplish this, but we also like to use it in our Kitchen to control appliances and such there. Apparently, another Alexa device placed in the kitchen is needed and connected to the bedroom Alexa so normal level voice can control all from anywhere in the home. We are deciding how to do this inexpensively. Should have done this planning ahead of time.	5	September 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	It is remarkable how small and powerful this echo is. The sound is very good and fills the living space nicely. With a little tuning, it is possible to dial in the perfect settings for best audio performance. Further more, the device is well built and feels solid without being too obtrusive, I wish only the cable would come in black.	5	September 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	It's an Alexa, everything you expect but with good sound quality.  I fills two rooms with music without issue.	5	September 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Sound is good. Have to spend additional $15 to get a black cord for my black echo. Thanks Amazon. A choice between cord color or simply defaulting to a matching color cord would be appreciated.	4	September 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Love it!!! Works great	5	September 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I should not have upgraded. The sound is wonderful, but the new Echo struggles with hearing. We now use it more as a blue tooth speaker.Updated: I was contacted by Amazon and shown how to reset the Echo. It is working much better now! Thanks Stephanie!	4	September 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	To start i'll say that the sound quality is better than the small dot but not great by any means. The voice recognition is absolutely horrible. I can stand right next to it and it is a 50/50 shot if it will react when i give a voice command. Now i use it to control an echo link and when you pause and tell it to resume then it isn't even smart enough to go back to the same source that it was playing from prior to pausing. Amazon products are starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth and this is no exception. Save your money.	1	September 23, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	"I have had this Echo for over a year now. The sound quality is great and I think each generation gets better. However, the 4th generation microphones can't hear most of the time. I've tried multiple different locations to see if that would help and always get the same results. My 3rd generation Echo dots in other rooms respond before this one will. Once, the Echo finally responds after saying ""Alexa"" 2 or 3 times it then doesn't hear my request so then I have to start all over again. Alexa...silence.. Alexa again...still silent.. Alexa one more time...hey finally a response! Sound a bit to familiar? This must be the teenager version of the Echo...lol! All in all it's a great sounding speaker I just wished it could hear better."	3	September 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Update: the Echo is making the hell demon noises almost every other day now. Reaching out to customer service.I love this Echo. But this echo sounded like hell demons were in my kitchen at 2am last night. Woke us up from a sound sleep. The loudest, creepiest, hell demon-esq almost static sound went off every 30 seconds bringing me to think we were finally under attack by another planet, Terrified of what this noise could be. After getting the courage to hunt down this god forsaken sound in my house in the middle of the night, we head into the kitchen where Alexa makes one last demon noise before detecting our movement, gives a little flash of light and stops.After researching this I guess is a known problem and rare. I still love her, but she’s unplugged at night now!	5	September 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have about 4 echo dots and I just really wanted to try the regular one. So for prime day i jumped on this and wow 🤩 the difference between the echo dot and this Echo is astronomical.The Echo Dot surprised me with how much bass it has for the size of the speaker. This echo blows me away The bass sounds clear and surprisingly strong for such a little speaker. Honestly, I feel like it would put some of my bookshelf speakers to shame that cost just as much or more and require a separate amplifier for power.I really feel like the biggest drawback is the microphone… No I’m not saying it is any worse than the echo dot but it certainly isn’t better. Sometimes I feel like you can’t hear me as I scream, Alexaaaaa! and other times it will randomly pop up as I’m whispering something similar.Overall, especially if you get it on a deal this is a fantastic Speaker. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in having higher Fidelity audio, but doesn’t want to jump for an audio file system. Bang for buck I don’t think that you can do much better than the echo. I’m very much considering getting a second possibly third or fourth.	5	September 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Although it is much larger than my old Echo Dot,  the voice clarity is not nearly as good.  It sounds 'muffled"" Also, at times, it has difficulty in understanding me."	3	September 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Not crazy about the sound.  Not as good as the older tower style. It also drops connect with web more often. I also noticed it doesn't hear as well and I have to repeat my alexa commands.	3	September 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is amazing. Using it for surround sound in the garage. Highly recommend!	5	September 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I am OK with the appearance, though the round ball like profile is too overwhelming, I much prefer the Echo dot. My first complaint is that the newer ball shaped device take more space, LOTS more space. and my MAIN complaint is that Alexa 4gen keeps loosing wifi connections and I need to jump through hoops to get it to reconnect. Sounds like I am a winner, and I may be. Take into consideration that I have limited mobility and un plugging and re-plugging back in the modem, router and ECHO and then accessing the app in my phone to reconnect is just a pain in the ass. I would like to return the ball for a dot, but I doubt that is going to happen. thank you.	3	September 21, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Every request fulfilled by this horrible box comes with an added request from the box.What's the weather?It's 65 degress outside.  *Do you also want to know the humidity?*What time is it?It's 9 am.  *By the way, I can also set timers and alarms.  Would you like to try that now?*Every.  Single. Request. Comes with an additional comment, question or suggestion.  I can't get this thing to do what it used to do when I bought it... Answer simple questions without adding interruptions.  I now own an obnoxious paperweight.Do not buy any Amazon product.  There are always strings attached.	1	September 20, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	Alexa works great but the sound honestly sounds like it is being played from a hollow drum. Not crisp and no bass. Mediocre at best.	3	September 20, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I do not like the sound quality. I get richer, clear sound with a $15 Bluetooth speaker. As for Alexa integration: it’s a useful as the Dot but getting it to work with SmartLiving isn’t going at all. It’s not very inclusive. Sooo, out of step with society. C’mon, Bezos!

Echo 4th Gen	"When you buy this product it's weight and circular design makes it not stable at all. It does have a screw in adapter on the bottom that some sort of stand can be inserted but associate did not mention nor was there anything written on the box it comes in to let you know and no ""stands"" near product to sell. Alexa at times does not get right response from your requests and has already fallen twice off a chair when using outside."	2	September 19, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	"I got this to replace my 2rd Gen Echo tower IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATION.  This new device is much worse for listening comprehension, and I must repeat everything loudly and slowly several times before she gets it.  The 'deafness' is extremely frustrating.  I wish that I had kept the 2rd Gen Echo which has the ""far-field voice recognition"" with the ""array of seven microphones tucked under the light ring"".  The 4th gen cuts microphones down to only four and moved their location.  It seems Amazon sacrificed hearing comprehension to give better sound quality.  I say they sacrificed too much.  Premium sound isn't any good if the device can't understand you.  I really hate this device."	2	September 18, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	I had did some research and had read where others were having problems with sound lvls and recommended others to get the white version, but I really wanted the black because it matches my living room.

Echo 4th Gen	I traded in a 1st generation Echo.  Setting up this new Echo was simple and trouble free.  It was a trivial matter to reset existing routines to this new Echo using the Alexa app.  The sound of the 1st generation Echo was great, but music is even better on this Echo.	5	September 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Great sound quality but this echo is worse at waking up on the command word than previous generations.The new inside temperature feature is cool but is often wrong (by 10+ degrees) so is somewhat unreliable.	3	September 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Better base response than the previous generation. Voice recognition is equal in my opinion but overall better device.	4	September 17, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	This Alexa worked ok for about 10 months, now a year later it’s either dead some days or dying, it will not pair with our echo dot that is literally 11 ft away and as of a few months ago (a week after the return date expires) we get the response to a request “I’m sorry I didn’t get that” every other day.  It has started making a very loud static noise which interrupts whatever it is the thing is trying to rate.  I have rebooted our internet and the device multiple times to no avail.  Very disappointing Amazon.	3	September 14, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is great but then you have to deal with the constant pestering for you to upgrade to the premium package to enjoy more music. It seems every time I start to enjoy the sound quality of the device I'll ask it to play something else and it'll either tell me that song is only on the premium package and would I like to upgrade now to hear that song or I can hear the song but before I do I get asked again if I would like to get the premium package blah blah blah blah. Anyways good sound until you have to hear what alexa or what ever name you choose for your device has to say about blah blah blah.	2	September 14, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	"I have a long story about my problems with Echo.  I had a 3rd Gen Echo which worked fine for my application in a Finished Basement used for music listening since 2021.  I had it connected / paired to 3 external BT devices : an IOTA Stereo preamp / amp stack; a Denon AV Receiver and a pair of JBL BT Speakers [Charge 3].  I would be able to select one of these devices to play Streamed music via the ECHO as the source and selector.  Suddenly on or about March 26, 2022 as I turned on the IOTA and asked Alexa to play Spotify, there was problem.  Same with the Denon and the JBL speakers.  As i checked the Alexa App to see if the devices remained paired on the list, they were listed but would not play.  I tried many measures (rebooting the Echo, Resetting the Echo , deleting and re-installing the Alexa App, Restarting my Verizon Router to no avail.  When I went to the App, looking to recognize and pair to the devices- the Echo would not recognize nor pair.  That required the first contact with Amazon Agents via Chatting.  The agent had me go through all the aforementioned steps again including Unplugging the Echo.  Nothing worked.  The agent said it must be the Echo unit itself.  Send it back to Them - it is out of Warranty due to its age, I was required to purchase a new 4th gen Echo (after many emails I was able to get a Discount of 25% on the purchase).  I received the 1st of the new 4th Gen Echos the following week.  I set it up as soon as I received it, and it did recognize and pair to my BT devices, play streamed music, but however, when I asked to play music without BT connections, the Echo would start up, then utter the words:  ""Sorry, That Device is Off Line"".  The frustration was increasing and the issue was perplexing.  Some light was shed when I went on Amazon's Community Forum under Devices in the Customer Service menu on their web site.  I posted my problem and received some many similar responses.  I use a Android based phone - Google Pixel 4XL - one poster's repsonse said that he had the same experience in the sudden mode - but not when using his wife's Apple iPhone !!  He suspected it was IT glitch in the Android / Amazon software.  After numerous phone call, Chats, and emails,  and more Posts to Amazon's Community Forum, finally a Supervisor (Mike , I think was his name),  contacted me and confirmed hat this issue was World Wide.  Then as suddenly as it stopped working, and without advance not from Amazon, sometime in May, the ECHO worked - it paired to the BT devices and played fime without problems that I cited!!  Then sometime therefater, the issue of Sorry, That Device is Off Line returned, but only when asking Alexa to play the Music from the Echo w/o BT connections.  More calls / chats and was asked to send that Echo back for a replacement. The replacement unit received in June (?), played fine when first connected and set up, but then after a few weeks, it happened again!!  That 2nd replacement unit was returned and the 3rd unit was received.  The same thing occurs despite the assurance form the agnt that this has the ""newest software and the problem is resolved"".  He was wrong !!  The 3rd replacement unit repeated the same issue.  I decided to send that 3rd unit back, got my full credit of $109 and ordered a new Echo Dot / with Clock.  That unit played fine until the other day - Same thing occured, when asking to play music from the Echo Dot (which recognizes and plays fine with any BT connection), it spews the same :  Sorry, That Device is Off Line"". I just learned that ECHOs are discretely Updated in the background by Amazon without Notice.  But only 3rd Gens and upward.  That's why my older 2nd Gen Echo located in another room in the house works fine without issues , although it has never been used to connect to any BT devices.  My wife uses it to listen to iHeart radio broadcasts an would be really Upset if I rocked that Boat.Bottom line : No. 1  The new Echo Dot with Clock will probably become a gift to my son for his new house.  This too is curious because he has 2 older Dots and uses the same smartphone I do (Google Pixel) in his apartment.  He does not have these issues. He does have his echo connected to a BT TV speaker system.  But his wife uses an Apple iPhone.  But his Dots are older units !!  This issue, particularly after Amazon admitted earlier that this was a World Wide issue and the fact that the units start off fine buy then suddenly changes, leads me to the one conclusion of a Software Glitch with Security Upgrades being done behind the scenes, affecting Android users.No.2 - after getting the Dot, the sound quality vs the 4th gen Echo is far inferior.No.3 - I am gifting the new Dot to my son, and ordering a Used 2nd gen Echo from Amazon to see if the problem evades the older Echo units.  Amazon only Updates 3rd gen and Up units.  If this Used 2nd gen does the same thing, it will go back and I will do without Echo in that finished basement.  I can use my Smartphone via BT to play music vai the BT devices.I have posted all of this on The Amazon Community Forum seeking any other advice or information to shed more light on this ongoing issue - at least for me.  PS:  i rebooted my Router numerous times, it is fully updated.  I could  not find any information that could lead to a Router issue that could be causing this."	4	September 13, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Very skeptical but VERY happy I purchased. I have a projector set up, have Fire TV and used Sonos pair for the speakers. It worked 70% of the time. Super frustrating that the connection was always Wi-Fi driven and not Bluetooth. When I heard you could connect Echo speakers to the Fire TV, I gave it a try. I got 1 for now and it’s perfect for the 14x14 room. Sound quality is great! I will probably add a 2nd one and put on the same side the Sonos were on but not needed. Worth the try!!	5	September 12, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I purchased this alexa because our older echo plus died and we needed the zigby capability. I'm not a huge fan of the ball design that's going on and it's footprint is alittle bigger than I expected. But it does what it was designed for.	4	September 12, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	"I finally decided on my birthday gift to myself and after studying the features I decided on the 4th Generation with the Smart Hub. I also elected to get the one with a rechargeable base so I could easily move it from room to room.My favorite thing was when I asked Alexa why she didn't have a male voice and she immediately changed to a male voice!!!!  I used it a lot for reminders like ""Remind me in 10 minutes to let the dogs inside"" and ""Remind me in 30 minutes for Oven"" and many other reminders and appointments.  I used the alarms and love to wake up to music and to turn the TV on and off and etc.  I have already recommended this one to many of my friends and one has already bought the same one.  I have yet to pair it with the doorbell or other smart devices but I shall."	5	September 11, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	While echo works amazingly, I purchased echo to enhance my fire tv sound. I thought I was having technical issues because my TV speakers were disabled. I found out that both echo and Fire TV speakers do not work in unison. It’s one or the other. The home theater sound is amazing! And the TV definitely  sounds amazing with echo. Just was wanting to have both work together. Which is disappointing.	5	September 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Does exactly what I need for it to do. Excellent job of recognizing commands and requests. Good at identifying individual voices for custom commands. Overall, much better than I expected. Sound quality is as good as can be expected from the size. Someday hope to try it with the subwoofer for my family room.	5	September 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	(Update):  Amazon Customer support acknowledged the defect and sent a replacement as the product was under warranty. The new one is working fine so far (day 1) ----I have owned echo since the 1st gen released.  This one is a significant regression when it comes to voice recognition.  Really feel pathetic trading in my first gen for this. Kids stopped using Alexa as they get frustrated that the device doesn't recognize their instructions as well as it did before. Even the echo dot I have upstairs perform better than these.  Amazon does not do a great job of support for the devices.  They did remote diagnostics, sw upgrade etc remotely and eventually said I need to send this for repair which could take anywhere up to 3 months.  Not worth the time and effort.	3	September 10, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Only down fall is it has to be plugged in at all times to work.	4	September 10, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I’m addicted to Alexa folks. I have an eco dot in every room. No more yelling through the house. I always have access to information. I have smart bulbs synced as well. She knows my voice and can hear me if I’m far away. I have 2 of these with the premium sound. They sound great! I play music all over the house from my phone and these premium speakers have great base for their size. It is easy to set up. The blue one is really pretty too. Makes a great gift!	5	September 10, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Really good sound and voice recognition.	5	September 10, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I've owned Echos since the original Echo Dot.  3rd Gen Echo had better microphone pickup I guess.  If it hears me at all while I'm facing away from the little gray ball of frustration it often gets what I say wrong.  Maybe it is a good thing that Alexa is losing her hearing in her old digital age.  At least I'm less worried about digital spying by Amazon.  Though it could just be a ploy.	2	September 10, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	El sonido	5	September 9, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Let me start this off by saying.. this thing is monstrous. It is much bigger than any previous Echo I've had.I figured the ""superior"" sound was a good trade off for the size increase, but after playing the same songs on an Echo dot and this one, I noticed very very little difference (perhaps a more resounding bass).Needless to say, I had no where to place this comfortably and had to return it because it wasn't what it's chalked up to be."	3	September 9, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is bad	5	September 9, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	We can't link this to our other Alexas for the life of us! Too bad because it has a great sound!	4	September 9, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded from a 2nd gen that I loved... Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me.  I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it.  The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible.  Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker.  I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me.  I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed.  Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me.  I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work.  There is definitely a flaw in the design or components.  Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues.  I am ready to throw this in the trash.***UPDATE: 10/5/22***Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me.  I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review.  They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones.  Why the reduction in microphones?  With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response,  and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond.  It is actually comical at this point.  I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond.  Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones.  I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing.  Huge disappointment for a great device.We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations.  By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time.  I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years.  2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio.  I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.	1	September 9, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality on this is incredible! I set it up next to my dad's $5,000 stereo system and we could barely tell the difference in the sound quality.I have 2 Echo Dots and was noticing it struggles with bass, especially at a high volume. This one keeps up just fine and sounds great. I have 2 in my open kitchen/dining/living room and it's an immersive sound experience.	5	September 8, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Took me a few tries to get it up and running but it has a decent sound for such a small speaker could have had more bass for me but I’m satisfied I bought it for my guest room in case whoever was staying over could listen to music while there	4	September 8, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I've been using the second generation echo and dot for many years. They were ok, but the sound wasn't very great. I took a chance and bought 2 of the new echos and what a difference. I've paired them with my older echos and dots and I love the sound throughout the house. Also they are much easier to navigate on the Alexa app.	5	September 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	This is by far the best, albeit the most expensive timer ever. I haven’t burned anything since I got her/it. I don’t hear very well so I have the volume on 10 and if I still don’t hear it my upstairs neighbor comes in to let me know. This maybe the start of a romance, or not.	5	September 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Ease of use	5	September 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I initially purchased two Echos.  I was so impressed with the sound I have since purchased an Echo Show for myself and one for a friend.  Super easy to install and set up.  The devices practically walk you through set up, step by step.  I'm a relatively old guy and even I found it very easy.  I would recommend getting The Echo Show first and then adding more speakers as needed.	5	September 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	My beef with this product is as follows:1) despite multiple people requesting it, Amazon refuses to create the ability to turn off Alexa saying “Now connected to [your name]’s” iPhone whenever you connect a device2) Alexa will randomly say something to you even though you didn’t give her a command. Super creepy that it’s always listening + has so many issues with thinking you gave her a command	2	September 6, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	The device itself is great, good sound. However Alexa‘s voice recognition software continues to get worse. it’s becoming more and more frustrating to deal with her.	3	September 6, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	"I feel like I'm a fanboy of Alexa. I have Echo dot 4th gen, Echo 4th gen and Echo Plus and I love the capabilities of this smart device and the sound quality.Yesterday though, I tried pairing all of the devices so they will play together, and after trying so many different things, I got 2 devices to work, but the Echo dot just can't connect to the other 2. Not as ""Alexa play everywhere"", and not by adding it to the group in the app.Alexa also acts strangely when she doesn't understand something and just bleeps something and shuts off. If I ask a long question, she'll cut me and start operating based on half of my sentence.She never was able to answer something that is relevant to the previous thing we talked about. For example: ""Alexa, what is the tallest building"" and she would tell me ""Burj Khalifa"", I'd ask ""And what is its height"" and she wouldn't know what is ""it"", she doesn't know we just spoke about the Burj Khalifa.The thing is that its been so many years already and it seems like there is no progress in her abilities and sometimes it's seems like she gotten worse through the years.I used to be able to play ""My sleep playlist from spotify"" but now she will always look for playlists made by Spotify instead of playing the playlists I created. Even if I'll name the playlist ""sleep by me"" or some other more specific name of a playlist that isn't public on Spotify, she'll say ""Sorry , I don't know a playlist called ""Sleep by me"" even though that is exactly the name, and she's connected to my Spotify user."	1	September 6, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	Waited for a sale, bought 2 and paired them with the echo sub. Now I have the sound I was looking for that the Studio failed to give me. Easily paired to the Sub and a 65” Omni tv now I have the sick theater sound I wanted with the full Alexa voice control. Technology has come so far when I was a kid I was the remote for my parents now I just say Alexa. Update….dropped one star for issues with sound dropping occasionally. Still has bugs to work out.	4	September 5, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	My 3rg generation echo dot easily connects to my iPhone and iPad.  I have 2 4th generation Echos and neither connects to Bluetooth at all. I have tried all the tricks posted by all the other Echo 4 owners who cannot connect and none works.

Echo 4th Gen	"I selected the Amazon pre-setup option when purchasing and all I had to do was plug it in when I got it and everything worked with no extra fuss.  The sound quality is very good and we've had no issues with voice commands.  I preferred the cylindrical look of previous Echo models but that's just my taste.  The light ring on this model is on the bottom and depending on placement can be more easily hidden from view than the older models that had it on top.  This is one ""improvement"" that I think is a step backwards."	5	September 4, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I wouldn't buy any echo device again.  I have 4, one is this model. All of them are very glitchy about when they work. Sometimes alexa says it will play music and then nothing happens,  mostly it plays something completely different than what you say. It's so frustrating to have purchased something that works so terribly.  It got worse and worse as time goes on, I've had almost 2 months now and my window to return is over. I do not recommend purchasing an echo device.	2	September 1, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"Amazon advertises that the Echo (4th generation) has a hub for Smart lights built in. It uses ZigBee connectivity. It does not work with Phillips smart lights according to Amazon technical support.  Amazon says that I need a Phillips Hue bridge and Alexa to control Phillips lights. The Phillips hue bridge I have is broken so I ordered  this Echo (4th generation) based on the advertising that this Echo has a built in hub. I need to return this device and buy a new Phillips Hue bridge. This has been a very stressful experience and I have lost faith in Amazon as a truthful source.Wait a minute: I just received a call from JJ Amazon support. He helped me set up my lights. He deserves a raise in pay. He patiently talked me through a very complicated procedure. There was also an error in a help file which stopped any further progress in the procedure. The error was in a direction that  said to follow the directions here.  The word ""here"" was in regular typeface not in blue or italicized. When I finally decided to click on the regular looking word  ""here"" the instructions took me to the next page and I was able to complete the procedure. JJ saved me from returning my ECHO (4th generation), from disappointment and anger. He also saved Amazon from losing a long time customer, Bravo JJ."	5	September 1, 2022	1

Bigger than I anticipated.Haven't figured out if I can use the internal TV speakers but that's ok.

Echo 4th Gen	I had a 2nd generation Dot that always worked great, including easily picking up my voice commands at a normal speaking volume even with the TV or other noise in the background. Unfortunately the full size Echo drops the ball for hearing commands. I often have to repeat myself more than once, raise my voice, move closer to it, etc. to get to respond. I've tried new spots in the room all to no avail. Its quite frustrating given how great the Dot worked.Other than the poor mic, the sound is rich and full even at moderate volume. Set up was super easy, basically plug and play because Amazon had my account all ready to connect.	4	August 31, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	After a long time finally, I managed to post a review about my echo. Its been almost eight months I am using this device.The build quality is very good, very robust. I really admire the fact that all the devices that are made by amazon has a super good build quality.If I navigate to the Sound of this device: I think, the quality of sound is more than decent, enough to fill you with quality music if you are inside around a room. I also use my echo as a speaker for my desktop computer, thanks to its 3.5 mm jack support.Voice assistance Alexa works great: using Alexa app it is very straightforward to integrate different devices/home appliances with echo to control them using voice command. But sometimes when there’s music playing loudly or noise around the echo: it struggles to listen to my command. Another issue I have encountered at times that echo respond very slow or don't respond at all against my command. It can happen for slow internet speed; I don’t know for sure.	4	August 29, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	My husband and I have 2 of these. One in the living room and another one in the bedroom. The one in the bedroom I used to help me sleep. I was waking upA number of times durning the night. Decided to try Ocean sounds ( which are Ocean waves ). I have it going all night. Both my husband and I have noticed that we are sleeping for longer period of times and deeper. The Ocean waves have mediative quality to them. The sounds lulls me to sleeps. I also like the morning news I get, with a following pod cast on a top story. The quality of the sound is excellent. I think I will get another one for the living room and a subwoofer. But that is only to deepen the already deep sound this little device gives off.	5	August 28, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I’m a bit disappointed with the Echo device. The sound is definitely an improvement compared to the previous models. The voice recognition does not work very well in my case in addition the echo moves on my desk because of vibrations when I play loud music	3	August 27, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Cuando lo encendi todo funcionó muy bien, pero 2 horas más tarde luego de un sonido extraño cuando reproducía música dejo de funcionar, ya no enciende la luz ni responde, simplemente murió. Es dinero perdido ya que lo traje a mi país y aquí no hay garantía.	1	August 27, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	I'm impressed with how well this unit hears us. It's located in an addition, with a brick wall between it and the bedroom, but it hears us through that wall just fine, even when we speak at a relatively low volume.	5	August 27, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I have several 3rd and 4th gen Echo Dots and they sound pretty good for general use, but this thing is a beast! I wanted a Dot in my media room that could really rock while I'm gaming on the TV and this delivers. The woofer really pounds out the base notes. The bass is on par with my big Samsung 1.5' subwoofer cube that the TV uses.Alexa works perfectly, no different than my other dots. AND it also has motion and temp sensors! I haven't used the smart home hub built in because Alexa can control my devices without it.All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this thing although my neighbors might not be when I'm cranking some tunes during a game ;-)	5	August 26, 2022	1
