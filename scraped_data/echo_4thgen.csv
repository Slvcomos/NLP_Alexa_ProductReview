Echo 4th Gen	High quality sound.	Much better than my old echo device. Deep and rich. Makes me wonder if they intentionally reduce sound quality in older devices to get you to upgrade lol. Anyways, I‚Äôm happy with it.	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 25, 2022	Elson Ceja	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEXT3C3LV22X3DU7SBQIAS2LDBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True
Echo 4th Gen	I am your master	Call mine Echo. Occasionally she will totally fail at understanding my request. After a few attempts I give up and say something else.

Echo 4th Gen	"""Support"" HACKED my computer and gave me a spyeye!"	It's 12:30 a.m. and I tried to hook up the speaker at 7 p.m. I have had to change my internet service and passwords. Still don't know if I am in the clear. I am a wreck and now Amazon wants $7.99 to return the source of all this grief. Free returns my ass.	1.0 out of 5 stars	August 25, 2022	S.

Echo 4th Gen	Great speakers, crap mic	Seriously, this is a lovely speaker. It sounds excellent. If you can get it to hear you, you‚Äôll love the sound.We often have to prompt it, 3-5 times, while the echo dot and plus in the other room have no problem hearing us. Very frustrating‚Ä¶My wife wants me to get rid of it, but I really want to keep the sound quality and thermometer.	2.0 out of 5 stars	August 25, 2022	Jon C.	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG6RLNSXFDQ4PCF2B664JVXJR5IA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True
