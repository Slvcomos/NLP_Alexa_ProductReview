Echo 4th Gen	QUICK SUMMARY:---------------------------The 4th generation Amazon Echo brings welcome upgrades from previous generations. The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.PREFACE:---------------------------I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.Tasks I utilize Echo for:---------------------------• (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs• (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information• (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)• (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)• (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledgeEnvironment:---------------------------The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It’s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).PROS:---------------------------• Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3” woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8” tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.• Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.• Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo’s speakers.• Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn’t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won’t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.NEUTRALS:---------------------------• Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it’s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.• Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.CONS:---------------------------• Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I’ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I’m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 – 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I’m saying correctly, if I’m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn’t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn’t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.• Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.	3	October 3, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I will start off on a good note:  The sound is so much better than the previous generations.  However....As you can see there are two devices in the photo.  The one on the right is the original purchased, the one of the left was the used one I was sent to replace the one I am having problems with.  Clearly the replacement one was used, it has a small faded stain on it.  The issues I am experiencing involves the voice recognition.  I can say its name and it does not respond, sometimes I will have to raised my voice to a yell for it to hear me which does not work well when others are sleeping.  Other times, my older generation device in my bedroom responds and there is a wall between me and it.  I am sitting aprx 8-10 ft away from the device and it does not hear!  Sometimes when I ask it for my notifications, the one in the bedroom answers me thru the wall which of course I can't hear the notification!  They are going to send me a third one, due to the fact the replacement one I received was used.  Hopefully, the third time is the charm!  Aside from the issues with this particular device, I have always loved my Echo Dots.	3	October 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I was super excited to get these, I’ve had an Alexa in every room for years and free entry upgrade. The idea of cute spheres I could mount on my walls was super appealing, so I got the maximum quantity and mounted them using a cute white stand.That’s about where my excitement around these new speakers ended. Every Alexa model has a few quirks here and there, but these things specifically are actual trash. The number of artifacts during playback is insane, frequent, and every one of them is obnoxious. They wake me up in the middle of the night frequently with their BS, I’m about to rip them off the walls and through them out the window.Examples:-This morning I got woken up super early by a crackle that can only be called “fireworks” playing on top of sleep sounds out 2 of my speakers.-every single time I’m playing music or sleep sounds and ask Alexa to lower or raise the volume she’ll do it at first and then goes into stutter mode rapidly turning the audio on and off in all speakers, or fading the sound in and out rapidly. Every time I use my voice to change the volume I have to stop and restart my music.-Sometimes Alexa decides to just not change the volume on voice command at all, regardless of which phrase you use to ask her to. Sometimes you ask her to do “volume 3” and she’ll play 3 everywhere except one room where she plays volume 10 and you jump up screaming “Alexa Stop” before your eardrums burst but she apparently can’t hear you over the noise she’s making and so you have to run to another room and scream at a different Alexa to get her to stop and then manually adjust the volume for that one speaker in the app-often not all speakers in a group or room will play together even if they show as grouped in the app and you select that specific group for playback. There are two ways to fix this, remove and re-add the offending speaker, or send music to that speaker solo for a minute and then try the group again.-Randomly the speakers produce really loud constant static. So you’ll have multiple speakers playing music in a group and suddenly one will go static and the only way I’ve found to get it working again is to unplug it, wait a few minutes, and plug it back in.-in general the speakers are not consistent in sound quality, the music sounds slightly more tinny in one, more rich in another, more base heavy in another…it’s slightly noticeable with music if you switch the one that’s playing back and forth to hear the sound quality differences… but where it’s really obvious is with sleep sounds, frogs will sound higher in one, deeper in another, and like possessed demon frogs in a third.  One of the speakers plays sleep sounds at double speed and I’ve not found a way to fix it. For that one music is sometimes normal and sometimes double speed.-occasionally an actual demon from hell talks over my speakers and during the Covid lockdown I for sure thought I was going crazy. Occasionally a male or female voice will just talk through my speakers briefly, one or two words, and then nothing for a few weeks till suddenly in the middle of the night someone talks out my speakers again. I got paranoid and put them on their own dedicated WiFi channel and super protected it with a random 32-character password, I monitor my network traffic and access, and even still sometimes these things will pick up or play a person talking randomly.Since I bought these speakers there has not been a single day where I haven’t had to try various workarounds to get them to function. I’ve become a regular on troubleshooting forums and invested so much of my time trying to solve various random problems…it’s gotten to the point where I avoid using them if at all possible because they just don’t work correctly. I’ve grown to actually hate them due to my experiences and while I was a die hard Alexa fan prior to these, I will probably never buy another Alexa product again. I’m going to try to ride them out as long as possible to get some semblance of my money’s worth, but very soon these are all going in the trash…maybe the next time it wakes me up at 4am with sudden loud audio artifacts…	1	August 23, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"[Edit] This is my second time to edit this review. I've now dropped my review from the original 4 stars down to 1 star. I'm at the point of regretting making the purchase of two of these.This was my first experience owning an Amazon Echo. Maybe if I had experienced one of the earlier models that actually worked, I would have a better impression, but this model really is a piece of crap. The micrphone hardly ever works right. When it does actually hear you speaking to it, it often misunderstands what you're saying. Most of the time, we have trouble getting it to work because it won't even stay connected to the wifi.Out of frustration, I decided to run a test. I purchased some of the Google Nest devices and hooked those up in the same rooms as the Amazon Echo devices. When the Echo devices misunderstand what we're saying, we try with the Google Nest devices and they work flawlessly.For the last two days, every single time we talk to Alexa, her response is that she can't understand because she isn't connected to the internet. Every time we get that response from Alexa, we turn to the Google Nest and it works perfectly. Every single time the Amazon Echo fails us, the Google Nest steps up to the plate and performs exactly how you want it to.I really have deep regrets about purchasing these Amazon Echo devices. I've seen other reviews that say how much better the older models of the Echo are and how much better they perform. It's a shame we had the bad luck of trying the Echo for the first time on a model that is truly a lemon, because it burned us out on the whole Echo product line and sent us running for the competition.If we continue to have the problems with our Echo devices, I'll probably just go ahead and disconnect them and see if I can get some of my money back by selling them on Ebay or something. I wish I had just purchased the Google Nest originally and never had to deal with all of the issues with this Echo. Also, the Google Nest costs much less than this garbage. How does that happen. It costs like 1/3 the price and works flawlessly? Why can't Amazon make their product as well as Google makes theirs? I don't know. Just super unhappy with these Echo devices right now.[End Edit][Original Review]I wanted to get some Echo devices for my kids for Christmas. Target had the best price with a pre-black friday sale on the 4th gen Echo with premium sound, but that's because they were actually shipping the lower cost Echo while charging for the Echo with premium sound. After straightening that whole mess out and deciding that I couldn't trust Target to not try to cheat me, I purchased the 4th gen Echo devices straight from Amazon.The sound is pretty good, but I have a lot of hearing loss, so I'm not actually a very good judge on that. But to a guy who is half deaf, they sound ok.My biggest problem is that I have to say something to Alexa usually 2-3 times before she responds. When I say ""Alexa..."" the light ring at the base lights up, so I know the Echo is awake and listening, but simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" are met with stone cold silence and have to be repeated a couple of times before Alexa acts or responds. I guess the technology for this just isn't where I thought it was when we purchased these.At least once a day, both of my Echo devices tell me they can't turn a light on/off because they can't find the device, which starts a lengthy process of my trying to get the Echo to re-recognize the smart home plug that we previously had configured. Why does the Echo randomly forget the smart home devices that have been installed? I'm still trying to figure that out.The Echo devices also randomly lose the wifi signal in our house frequently. In the first two weeks, I can count at least 7 times one or the other of our Echo devices could not connect to our wifi, while multiple computers, tablets, phones, and smart tvs were all connected to the wifi with ease, the Echoes were seeming to struggle to maintain a connection to the wifi.We were having fun with the ""kitty kitty"" skill you can download to have alexa play a sound of a kitten calling it's mommy. Our cats went crazy trying to find the kitten. But of course, nothing is free in life, especially not when Jeff Bezos feels he can squeeze another penny into his pocket, so Alexa wants to run down a lengthy list of other sound options for the ""kitty kitty"" that can be purchased. If you don't want to listen to this long listen of purchase options, you can say ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa no thank you"", but either way, if you don't buy one of the add ons, Alexa gets a serious attitude in the tone of her voice to let you know she disapproves of your decision to not throw your money at Jeff Bezos.It's not just with the ""kitty kitty"" skill thing either. There have been several occasions when Alexa had such a tone in her voice that it made me stop and turn to look at the Echo. I would not be surprised if the blue light ring at the base was pulsating in a blood red color.Just based on all the hype about these, I seriously expected better performance from them, so I was really disappointed. With the problems we have using these 4th gen echo devices, I can't even imagine how much it was a problem with the 1st gen devices. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy these again or recommend them to anyone else. I think that maybe future versions will work a little better and not require you to repeat commands to Alexa so often. But if Alexa doesn't lose her attitude, I expect that by the time 8th gen devices roll out, Alexa will have the ability to hover in the air while spitting pea soup all over everything in the room and speak with a demonic voice as she stops asking you to buy add-ons and demand that you give all of your bank account and credit card info directly to Jeff Bezos."	1	January 14, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	"Update October 11—-DO NOT BUY. AMOAZON WILL FORCE UOU TO PREPAY/BUY REPLACEMENT WITH PROMISE TO REFUNF FULLY —THEN KEEP/STEAL UOUR KONEY (about $200), THEN BATTER AND BURY YOU WITH ABUSIVELY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE OVERSEAS FAKE CS WHOSE ONLY GOAL, IN MY EXPERIENCE, IS TO GRIND YOU AND LIE TO YOU.Update Aug 29 #2-----Now I receive two emails (and NOT the requested escalation for corporate repeatedly requested) from Amazon filled with flat out lies about refunded money not delivered and misleading summary of sneaky offer of ""courtesy"" offered in ""empathy"" but then ""summarized"" -- in complete contradiction to the courtesy characterization furnished and my explicit rejection of the offer if in any way related to a resolution--- in as being a ""part of a resolution.""Update Aug 29--131 minutes (2hours 11 min) on call with Amazon CS todayAmazon reps, including American supervisor Andrew M--- who again refused to keep its promised or: 1) send replacement for broken Echo--free of charge, 2) provide full refund as promised for the forces pay-up-front con job of getting customers to buy yet a second Echo under lie of full refund, (sent this back for refund and had to fight for hours get the purchase price fully refunded), and 3) provide and apply up-front credit for up front purchase of yet another replacement speak --which arrived defective/unusable--So, Amazon still owes me 1) full refunds for all Echo 4s purchased, 2) a replacement speaker for the original speaker it took a year to ""tech expert"" diagnose as defective, and a GIANT APOLOGY for its abusive CS team.Did I mention--- the American supervisor tried to three-card-monte $100 Amazon promo credit (not a gift card or refund) as a ""courtesy"" that he later stated was given ""in hopes this would resolve the issue""---- IE-- sneaky stealing of some $150 and NO apology.  Rejected this sneaky move.  Then he said he couldn't transfer me to his supervisor, only a peer. Then he said he couldn't do that. Then he said he was transferring call to another representative for me to climb the CS abuse ladder again, only to place me on hold for about 10 minutes and transfer me overseas.Update July 18–Amazon STILL hasn’t given me the $160 it owes me. Beat part, the fake silence by CS trick—frequently employed to entice idea call dropped so customer ends call—then denial of such followed by more silence and then click.Update: July 12, 202228+ HOURS --- Trying to get back $160-- for DEFECTIVE ECHO 4Amzon told me I needed Echo 4 generation to supposedly solve the high-repetition ads on ad-free TuneIn Live Premium (commercials are playing as I type this).$80 -- Amazon instructed me to buy Echo 4 coupled with Amazon CS promise of full refund. Amazon delayed unreasonably the refund and then botched it---sending $80 to someone else.This is NOT a refund to me.$80 Amazon billing error ---Same as above.Now I am mired in the obstinate passive aggressive CS battering of emails and call center script reading telling me, essentially to suck it up or go spend hours of your time tracking down the money we gave someone else:""Contact the bank"" we sent it to and ask them to give you your money.----------------------WHAT?-------17 hours and counting --- Fake CS. Tech can't/won't solve problem that speaker doesn't sync. (Installed app several times and unplugged speaker even more---for about an hour. Prior Echo 4 took 5 minutes to one try at plug in to sync. So I know this second one is defective.)Tech ""support"" consists of nothing more than statements of reinstall the app and re plug speaker.Something that didn't solve the problem before fighting through maze of off-shore CS to reach ""tech expert."" Forget that these ""experts"" believe the actual speaker is the reason the Amazon's ad-free streaming service is streaming commercials--which is zany, if not obviously wrong, at face value.But each time this same commercial bludgeoning occurs these ""tech experts"" do nothing more than the re-app, re-plug dance after hours of navigating through layers of what--""tech anti-experts?"""	1	July 8, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	What I liked – Better bass that my original echos No commercials in my flash briefing It has a hub just like my studios Better bluetooth headphone range than my first gen echos,What I don’t like – There isn’t any switch in settings for local voice control It can’t hear as well as my original echos The sound is in one direction It changes my bluetooth mesh lightbulbs when I turn them onOverall it isn’t a bad upgrade for four generations later than my original echos. But it has some flaws.First it doesn’t seem to have any switch for local voice control. So will the hub work when the internet isdown with my zigbee lights? My studios still control zigbee lights, but not sure if this one can. The newecho has trouble hearing me, but I think this is due to low power mode, as it has to recover before it canlisten. So I have to often repeat commands. The bass is nice and the sound is in one direction more likea normal speaker, but I got used to the 360 degree sound, so this seems a little backward to me. Thesound isn’t bad just different. One thing I hate is the interaction with my bluetooth mesh alexa onlybulbs. If I tell it to turn on light 2, it always turns it on at 100% and white. This is different from mystudios which just turn on the light at the current settings. I keep the downstairs light blue and 5%, if Igo downstairs and say to my studio turn on light 2, it is blue and 5%, if I say turn on light 2 to the gen 4it turns on the light white at 100%.Overall it isn’t bad, I will keep it, but I have the original echo in the closet just in case..	3	July 10, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Update: Echo can only hear you about 1/2 of the time. Although this 4th gen Echo has some really nice features that we like, her ability to hear you isn't one of them. We can be standing right in front of her, and our Flex in a hallway on the other side of the house hears us and responds way more than she does. Not kidding. How can it, facing in the other direction walls away hear us and she can't? Our first generation Echo hears us 100% of the time, the 4th gen... maybe 1/3. We put her in the room where we are closest to her when speaking, but it doesn't really help much. In taking away the 360 mics and making her so focused in one direction, they lost something vital. SO majorly annoying. She sounds great, though. Just needs a hearing aid.Original review:The 4th gen Echo has better sound, a built-in smart hub and lots more bells and whistles than my 1st gen Echo, which is five years old and still going strong. I mainly use my Echo to check the weather, time various cooking projects or dog recesses, set zillions of reminders, answer questions, read Audible books, and play a lot of Spotify. What I REALLY, REALLY wanted Echo to do was to be able to call 911.Emergency calling: Within a few minutes of getting the Echo out of its box, it was set up for everything but AT&T and 911 calling. That took a bit of walking through instructions, squirreling off to my iPad (ADD for the win), and then back again to finish setting it up. I was able to connect to my AT&T account on the Alexa app very easily, and specify which devices are at what addresses. Most of our devices are at our home, but one of my daughters has her tablet at her other mom’s house. I loved that I could specify that her tablet was there. Now when I call emergency services (well, I hope never to call), they’ll know where we are if we use one of our Amazon devices. Way too cool!Overall, the sound is better, it has more features, and I really love that I was able to link in calling out on my Amazon devices via my AT&T account. I absolutely love that feature.Better sound is great, too, because I listen to music a lot. The sound is just richer and more detailed. No, this isn’t a Bang and Olufsen, but it sure sounds nice.One caveat. The light ring is on the bottom, so if you have this on a crowded surface as I do, it’s harder to see the light ring. If you have yours in a clear area, just ignore that. But for me, I preordered a wall mount. That will get the Echo raised to where we can see the light ring, and it will also clear the bit of space where I had it.Very pleased with this newest generation of Echo.	3	October 22, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought a 2nd generation echo when they first came out years ago. I keep it in our kitchen and use it daily for music, news and general inquiries. I have also setup some smart switches so I can control lights using voice through Alexa. When I upgraded to smart thermostats I purchased one that has Alexa built in. I noticed recently that the Echo was not interpreting my requests very well and frequently would not play a song after a request. I assumed it was just getting old so decided to upgrade to this latest device that was on sale during Prime days. I assumed there would be a significant improvement in sound quality but it is marginally better. not enough to justify replacement. I find I need to yell at this echo for it to recognize my voice, the old one worked much better. Lastly, I moved my old 2nd gen echo into the upstairs bedroom thinking I could play music up there but Alexa does not support that. Appears you need to have an individual Amazon account for each device if you want to have it play Spotify. I have a Spotify family account and have no interest in paying for Amazon music premium as well. I am disappointed with this and now I have two echoes that are unreliable when it comes to playing any requested music. I am seriously going to look at Google now.	3	August 1, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I am OK with the appearance, though the round ball like profile is too overwhelming, I much prefer the Echo dot. My first complaint is that the newer ball shaped device take more space, LOTS more space. and my MAIN complaint is that Alexa 4gen keeps loosing wifi connections and I need to jump through hoops to get it to reconnect. Sounds like I am a winner, and I may be. Take into consideration that I have limited mobility and un plugging and re-plugging back in the modem, router and ECHO and then accessing the app in my phone to reconnect is just a pain in the ass. I would like to return the ball for a dot, but I doubt that is going to happen. thank you.	3	September 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I have had this Echo for over a year now. The sound quality is great and I think each generation gets better. However, the 4th generation microphones can't hear most of the time. I've tried multiple different locations to see if that would help and always get the same results. My 3rd generation Echo dots in other rooms respond before this one will. Once, the Echo finally responds after saying ""Alexa"" 2 or 3 times it then doesn't hear my request so then I have to start all over again. Alexa...silence.. Alexa again...still silent.. Alexa one more time...hey finally a response! Sound a bit to familiar? This must be the teenager version of the Echo...lol! All in all it's a great sounding speaker I just wished it could hear better."	3	September 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I received my echo’s backin Oct. 22nd 2020.I’ll start out with saying I’m totally blind. I got 2 Echo’ 4thgeneration devices. To me, the sound on the 4th generation echo compared to the full size prior cylinders is worse to me. The 4th generation echo send the sound out mainly in 1 direction. The cylinders sent it out all around.The 4th generation echo comes with a short power cord. Went and got a power cord extender to be able to plug it in. That is a minusThe 4th generation echo doesn’t pick up my voice as well. This is probably because of the fact it only has 4 microphones and not 7. MinusThe buttons Arrangement on the 4th generation echo is different then the prior echo cylinders along with the prior dot’s. The older echo have the Volume up at 12 (Side of power cord coming out), Echo button at 3, Volume down at 6 and Microphone button at 9. The 4th generation echo has the Echo button at 12, Volume up at 3, Microphone at 6 and volume down at 9.Speaking of volume! This 4th generation echo as far as the Alexa voice isn’t as loud. It is at least 1 full volume step lower. Example, the prior cylinder at volume 6, I need to have the 4th generation echo at least at volume 7 for the same Alexa voice volume. MinusIn testing.1. Temperature The 4th generation echo hub will go below 32F. Plus.2. Echo 4th generation echo built in temperature is a lot closer. plus3. Echo 4th generation echo will not read battery status of sensors or humidity. No improvement.4. If you have a lot of sensors/bulbs connected on an Echo ZigBee hub. If you leave it plugged in, things will work OK. Otherwise if you want to move them over to the Echo 4th generation Echo, you’ll need to go through a lot of steps for each device.5. If you unplug the Echo 4th generation and plug it back in, you have to wait for it to recalibrate the temperature sensor 45 minutes to 60 minutes. Minus.6. I’ve had the Echo 4th generation just stop responding and had no audio output at all. I’ve had this happen at least 2 times within the last 7 weeks. Had to unplug the echo and plug it back in to get Audio back. The Echo showed online, I could do drop in to it from other devices in the house, I could tell one of my other echo’s in the house to set volume to 10 on the 4th generation echo and none of that caused audio to come back. The only thing that get the Audio back was unplugging and plugging it back in. Minus7. Sensor/light ZigBee testing echo 4th generation hub. All sensors/lights worked accept for an older plug that I had to use the Alexa App to get it online being the 4th generation echo thought it was an bulb when I did a scan for new devices. minus8. If you connect an Bluetooth headset to the Echo 4th Generation, the echo doesn’t use the microphone on the headset! It only uses the microphones on the unit itself. No improvement9. If you are using an Bluetooth headset and you have Follow-up mode turned on for that Echo, the Follow-up mode doesn’t work at all when using the Bluetooth headset. If you ask the Echo to turn on Follow-up mode, it will tell you it isn’t supported. No improvement10. If you have a fan blowing on the echo or over the echo! This will make the temperature way off! This is true for the Echo 4th generation. No improvementIf you have an old Echo dot! Then you will find a large improvement in the 4th generation echo over a DOT of any type.If you don’t have a echo at all or you are wanting to see what the smart home automation is about and are willing to deal with a very basic ZigBee hub! Then this may be for you.If you have other question; Post them and if I find them and can help I will.	1	December 17, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	(Update):  Amazon Customer support acknowledged the defect and sent a replacement as the product was under warranty. The new one is working fine so far (day 1) ----I have owned echo since the 1st gen released.  This one is a significant regression when it comes to voice recognition.  Really feel pathetic trading in my first gen for this. Kids stopped using Alexa as they get frustrated that the device doesn't recognize their instructions as well as it did before. Even the echo dot I have upstairs perform better than these.  Amazon does not do a great job of support for the devices.  They did remote diagnostics, sw upgrade etc remotely and eventually said I need to send this for repair which could take anywhere up to 3 months.  Not worth the time and effort.	3	September 10, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Bigger than 3rd gen echo, but good sound quality.  Connected easily to my Alexa network.  BUT, I cannot understand why they paired a black echo with a white power cord.  Was this a mistake, because it looks as if I am using the wrong cord.  Cannot use power cords for previous versions of Alexa/Echos.  Small, but extremely irritating issue.	3	October 13, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Okay, so I have 2 of these paired with a Fire 4K TV stick.If I'm only playing music through Amazon's music service... incredible sound and the volume is more than enough for any sane person to thoroughly enjoy.  For reference, we listen at about Volume 4.BUT...When it comes to watching a television show through the Fire 4K stick... it's so frustrating it makes me want to return them.  100% of the time, we set ""Volume 10"", which is maximum volume.  And even *that* doesn't always allow us to hear the dialogue coming through the show.I've tried SO many settings to fix it.  I've paired and unpaired countless times.AND there's more.For some reason, we have to reboot our 4K Firestick every single day before we watch a show.  Otherwise, at some point during the day, it disconnects from the speakers for TV.  And only for TV.  Because if we ask for music, it works just time, every time.Moral of the story:  happy with them for music.  Terrible as a speaker system for television.(Wife is a travel nurse.  We move every 3 months.  I was *hoping* they would be an incredible solution to save space vs. a full audio system.  I was wrong.)"	3	July 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I bought an Echo 4th gen and an Echo Dot (4th Gen) in a package.  I've been using them for 9 months now. These devices do play music from Amazon Prime Music account but the Alexa software is pretty buggy.  Example:  For months I couldn't get the two paired Echo devices to play Amazon music (or anything else) on Everywhere group.  Then recently I was able to get that to work, BUT Alexa would only play one song from Amazon music then shut all devices down.  I made sure network connectivity was not the problem. Both Echo devices  are paired and connected to the same wi-fi network.  My Everywhere Group includes both devices.  I could play music all day long on a single device at a time.  Today (9/29/2021) I found that if you start initially playing Amazon music on Everywhere, it will shut off all devices after one song, BUT, if you initially start playing NPR/Kuow (from iHeart Radio) on Everywhere, you can then switch to Amazon music and songs will continue to play.  This is what I mean by ""buggy"".Now for the rest.  The other Alexa features like Lists, Routines, Chore Chart (blueprint), Task Tracker (blueprint) are so far pretty useless.  What I wanted to do was use Alexa to help us  (two adults) manage our time, like keep track of chores, with daily reminders, and keep track of tasks lists for each of us.  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to use more than a single ""list""  or tracker and it better be for a single person.  I created two lists (using Lists & Notes, not Blueprints), one a shopping list, one a to-do list.  Alexa had trouble keeping these lists separated, and adding/removing items at least from voice commands.  I also tried creating a couple of Skills using Chore Chart blueprint and Task List blueprint.  These also did not work for multiple people, and you cannot edit the items without logging into the Blueprints web so it's not very useful for a daily Task List that needs to be dynamic.Bottom line, it has taken 9 months to get this far. I was willing to put some learning time in, but not have to take a class or hire a technician just to get things working.  I find the Echo hardware are adequate speakers for me, but Alexa software is not.  Amazon's online documentation is woefully inadequate, difficult to find and very general.  I did not try the Help & Feedback from the iOS Alexa app since I find reading documentation on a phone screen difficult.  The forums are sometimes helpful if you use suggestions cautiously.  I  have spent a lot of time trying to get Alexa features working, and my lack of success does not make me happy.  I admit my expectations may have been too high."	3	September 29, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	The speaker sound is horrible. It sounds muffled, unclear and there are no sound adjustment controls for the speaker. .  Unbelievably, my 1ST GEN Alexa has great sound. I wish I could buy another.	3	October 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"This was a Christmas gift for my 98 year old Grandmother.  My wife and i have an earlier echo generation and love it.  In my grandmother's case she loves the music, and help with reminders.  The problem arose during setup.  To create an account for my grandmother's echo it was required she had an email address.  She is 98 and does not use the internet nor has an email account.  So i elected to include it with my account.  All was good until we found out only one device could stream Amazon Music at a time.  My grandmother's Echo came with a promotional 6 month Amazon Music Premium feature while my wife and i only use the free Amazon Music with our Prime Account.  Suddenly, it became almost a competition where our echo would play one song then request if wanted to move the streaming service to our device.  We would have it and then lose it as my Grandmother at her location did the same thing.  I called Amazon about the problem and spoke with someone with a heavy Indian accent who claimed they could resolve the problem and after 20 minutes dropped the call.  I tried again and got a second Indian representative who was brash, rude, continually talking over me and saying ""just let your 98 year old Grandmother listen to her music!"".  Giving up i tried to politely end the call, where the representative asked if there was anything else he could help with.....  I was hoping i would get a survey about the call, but instead i got an form email from the rep saying it was a pleasure talking with me and he was glad he could help....  No survey.  On the same day this conversation occurred my wife got a charge on her credit card from Amazon for a Prime Membership.  When checking the credit card purchase online i clicked on the merchant who charged her and i was taken to my Amazon Prime Account.....  I did  not purchase a second Prime account and most assuredly not on my wife's credit card.  Well we got that charge cancelled but are still wondering what happened and are living with the competing Echo's.  Yet to be figured out.  The device is very nice....  The Customer Service to help us set it up...  Not so much."	3	January 13, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	This Alexa worked ok for about 10 months, now a year later it’s either dead some days or dying, it will not pair with our echo dot that is literally 11 ft away and as of a few months ago (a week after the return date expires) we get the response to a request “I’m sorry I didn’t get that” every other day.  It has started making a very loud static noise which interrupts whatever it is the thing is trying to rate.  I have rebooted our internet and the device multiple times to no avail.  Very disappointing Amazon.	3	September 14, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Update: I gave more stars back,After this writing this review they called me up to give me a discount on the replacement. I was just about to purchase a new one when they called. I couldn't handle the bad sound it was giving on my favorite songs.  I like that they did that, but still make sure you pay attention to the sound and get more warranty or something. Bought the last one in Sept. of 2021 and it broke by June of 2022.  I had these less than a year. I never raise the volume past 6 most days... over time the sub just stop producing good sound and at some point I'm screaming at it to hear me. I have the bass on 0 and it still have that blown out sound. Like what happened? I'm sure they plan for them to break after a few months so you have to consider buying a new one. My whole house have one in every room or section and I'm thinking about tossing them all out and getting google just because you can whisper to those and they hear you. I also have flex throughout and and set them up to connect to the main echos to respond. I mostly use them for music throughout my place. Very disappointed in how bad they aged in less than a year.	3	June 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Add the title said,  I was expecting a clock airing and there is no led clock. Nothing in settings and when using voice command... Alexa says this device can't do that	3	October 14, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Almost everything about this Echo 4th Gen is a step backward. Sound has a little deeper bass, otherwise I like the sound of the Echo Plus 2nd gen better.  It does not respond to voice commands as well as the Plus.  It is like it cannot hear you as well.  Having the illuminated ring at the bottom where you cannot see it is just dumb, unless you have it on a glass shelf above head height.  Concerning Echo/Alexa in general, I cannot believe they have not made it any smarter in all these years.  Instead, they are putting all their energy into marketing gimmicks.  If I say the exact name of a song I want to hear, sometimes it will choose one with a similar name rather than the exact title I requested.  Stop doing what you think I want and start doing exactly what I say.  You should only play an alternative if I stated a title that does not exist or was not stated correctly.  I get ""Hmmm, I dont know the answer to that"" to some pretty simple questions as well.  They have it evolved to the knowledgeability of a nine year old and have not evolved it since.  I may begin to look at alternatives, as I cannot support this stupidity much longer.  In large companies, Marketing typically always has the power over Engineering.  I know this, as I am a retired Engineer from a large fortune 50 company.  It is apparent that Amazon is the same way.  I can hear the debate now... ""It won't work as well that way.  Yeah, but it is shaped like a ball and that is cool"".  Start selling the Echo plus again and I may buy one or two more.  Otherwise I am done."	3	May 14, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Let me start off by saying I have been a LONG time user of the Echo platform, since gen one and have been a proponent of the platform. I have 20+ echo's and even upgraded some of them as time passes so maybe gone through 30. I just ran across an issue that had apparently popped up sometime last summer but just happened to us as well. I have bought all the Echo's in our family and registered them under my name, pretty standard. Up until we switched phones 3 weeks ago, my wife, who is in my household account, was ALWAYS able to go into her Alexa app and set alarms and reminders on any of our Echo's. As of yesterday that no longer is the case. She can only set alarms or reminders for her phone.I spent 2+ hours texting with 5 people in tech support, got so frustrated that I asked to be connected in person on a call. Talked to two more tech support people on the phone as well. They are telling(insisting) me that only the person who has the Echo registered to their name can set alarms or reminders on those Echo's. So if you have three kids with phones, they can no longer set alarms on any echo device. You can do it verbally still of course. But now if they want an alarm/reminder set in their room they have to walk up the stairs and verbally set it. How does this make ANY sense that only one person in a household can access the alarm/reminders on their mobile devices!?! Takes away half of our functionality!The funny thing is, every one of those techs said that is how it is supposed to work, even though for the last 4+ years my wife has been able to set her own alarms and reminders for our kids. THIS TAKES AWAY HALF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ECHO'S(if you have a family). That is how she set our kids alarms all through COVID. After a quick google search I found several AMAZON FORUM posts going back a year that this has been happening to other people as well. Just google 'Unable to view or set alarms on Household devices' and you can read for yourself. I screenshotted them as I suspect they will somehow disappear.I think something might be changing at Amazon with the Echo platform and they are slowly taking away this functionality as peoples accounts change or something. I can't make rhyme or reason of it that more people haven't brought this up though. But based on the silly Amazon rep responses and the consistent denial that this was a viable function from multiple Amazon tech's, Amazon appears to have no reason to try and fix this. I suspect they may be rolling out some sort of paid service for Echo's soon. How much money did Bezos lose until Amazon became ubiquitous with everyone was ordering online? He did just recently run up in the annual fee, etc.  Get them a taste or two for free then get them hooked. He is playing the long game for sure. Just my conspiracy theory.Anyways, I will definitely be sending back the other Echo's and thermostats I just bought and may look at switching over to google's devices. Thankfully all my home switches are compatible. Just beware, Echo is no longer nearly as useful for families(or households) anymore and you may want to avoid.	1	July 12, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Not enough of a difference from the $10 Echo Dot to warrrant the much higher price.  Good but not special.	3	October 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have an echo dot, fire tv cube and a new echo. The microphone on the echo seems less responsive than the old echo dot I have. I can be sitting in the living room, where I have the echo, and when I say, hey Alexa, it doesn’t light up. Often, I can try to play a song in the living room and the echo dot in my bathroom will start playing. Even the fire tv cube in my bedroom responds better than the echo. I even changed the wake words for the devices in case that was the issue, however it may have helped the echo only slightly. The dot still responds from two rooms away, yet the echo doesn’t always respond from ten feet away. Otherwise it is a good device. The sound is much better than the dot. There is distortion if I turn it too loud but even turning it down a little clears it up, and is still plenty loud to jam out while cleaning. 😊	3	July 31, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Bought during prime day a month ago, one day Alexa started rattling and warbling like Katherine Hepburn in 'On Golden Pond'. Speaker obviously blown, but never played music loudly. Amazon customer service is OK, but I'm waiting a week-two weeks for a replacement? I should've been sent a replacement first (I had to box up the broken one and ship it back to them at a UPS store) and when the replacement arrived, put the defective one in the same box and send it back. I've been an Amazon Customer for more than 20 years (back to when they only sold primarily books, remember?) I buy practically everything through them and I just see their once legendary customer service and products slipping away	3	August 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded from a 2nd gen that I loved... Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me.  I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it.  The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible.  Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker.  I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me.  I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed.  Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me.  I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work.  There is definitely a flaw in the design or components.  Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues.  I am ready to throw this in the trash.***UPDATE: 10/5/22***Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me.  I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review.  They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones.  Why the reduction in microphones?  With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response,  and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond.  It is actually comical at this point.  I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond.  Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones.  I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing.  Huge disappointment for a great device.We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations.  By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time.  I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years.  2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio.  I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.	1	September 9, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I love Alexa. It might be more accurately described as a love/hate relationship, but at the end of the day, I Adore that spicy bish. I love asking Alexa  strange questions or just throwing out song requests or a reminder or timer throughout my day, I utilize the crap out of her! Alexa answers are hit and miss, I do receive a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that"" but all in all the idea behind Alexa is sound. I have owned at least 1 Echo and an echo dot (if available) since its inception, and continue to be impressed with the utility of it. This generation of Echo has been a real disappointment to me. While Alexa is becoming more fluid in this iteration,  in some ways it feels like a rather large step back from its predecessors.  Let's talk about this generations audio, shall we? I dislike that when using verbal commands to Alexa for volume up or volume down, it's  very basic and uses a 1-10 system. This can be modified using the plus or minus sign on the device itself, or using the Alexa app on phones (which, to its credit, allows for a 1% to 100% sliding scale to get the desired volume). However, if you are like me and want to be able to say ""Alexa, set volume to 22%"" Alexa will set the volume to the nearest  1-10 volume, in this case, it would set the Echo to volume 2. As an audiophile this feels clunky and lacks ease of use I've come to expect from Echo devices. The sound quality is alright, but I miss the 360 degree sound that previous generations gave me. Fourth generation Echo's also lack music clarity, and the bass is not impressive in the least.Next up, the shape, sigh. This 4th generation Echo looks like a crystal ball and takes up more space while also being a lot more noticeable. Perhaps this is intentional, but I prefer the more discreet shape of the 3rd generation. I am not impressed with them doing collaborations with designers like Diane Von Furstenberg when so many more necessary features like better audio quality and the Echo's voice sensitivity are sorely lacking. I'd love to see Amazon do a partnership with a company like Boss, to give us useful upgrades and higher audio quality."	3	December 27, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I bought two of these to set up a wireless stereo setup. The bass is insane, to the point where you have to turn it down to hear much of anything else. The midrange is recessed to a nearly objectionable amount, but for the price it's tolerable, I guess.Amazon must do something with spatial audio because the stereo image on these is also insane. Very nice.As for the Alexa thing, I already have four other Alexa eavesdroppers. This is more a review of Echo as an audio device and stereo deal. Short version: don't do it.Linking my two echoes together was easy enough, but one got put in  one ""room"" and one unassigned, and after days I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that other Echo into the same ""room"", but it's just a labeling thing. Connecting them in stereo was simple. Then came the issues.First... these only work in stereo if you stream from an official Amazon(tm) service. That means Amazon music (and probably Prime video). So if you wanted to use these in stereo for TV or YouTube... nope. Doesn't work.And even using this with Amazon Music... is problematic. I have to connect to the pair twice before they start playing, but I can deal with that. But then the Amazon Music app might reset and then I have zero control of what's playing. The speakers keep going on the playlist, somehow, but the app completely loses any sense of what's going on. So seeing what's playing or skipping songs isn't do-able.And as a Zigbee hub... well one works great, but Alexa has no sense of common controls like changing light colors in a group (only individually). It's a great piece of hardware stymied by limited software. There's no reason Alexa couldn't crib notes from every other zigbee app out there, and use my wifi network to stream audio data from one Echo to the others when I bluetooth connect to it. These would make a great little theater setup if they got that to work and kept the sale pricing.Of course, I don't use the thing for Alexa at all, which should probably say something about the strange product planning involved as well. Kudos to the hardware guys, but what is the software group up to?"	3	December 16, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I got the echo to use a speaker for my fire stick to stream tv and movies. However, when paired wirelessly the sound was not very good. It sounded like the speaker had a bunch of reverb or something. I tried a bunch of different fixes with the amazon customer service people but nothing worked, so I got a replacement echo but the sound was the same. However, when I connected the speaker to the Fire Stick with an aux cable, the sound was much improved. It is just annoying that I had to do that.So if you were thinking using the Echo as a wireless speaker to stream shows and movies, I would caution against it.	3	August 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	DON'T BUY until Amazon fixes this annoying, completely unnecessary stupid feature.	3	October 16, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	My 3rg generation echo dot easily connects to my iPhone and iPad.  I have 2 4th generation Echos and neither connects to Bluetooth at all. I have tried all the tricks posted by all the other Echo 4 owners who cannot connect and none works. I have set up and reset up  these Dots (using wifi since blue tooth doesn't work) and it made no difference. There is some defect in these devices. Do not purchase if bluetooth connection is important to you.	3	September 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	This is the fifth Echo device I've purchased.  My 2 previous Echos are the Plus 2nd Generation.  Those are excellent.  I wanted to purchase another of those but this one appears to have replaced that.  First of all I wouldn't consider this to be gray, it looks black.  Second, they supply you with a WHITE power chord instead of black.  This doesn't make sense and it looks stupid.  The chord is also significantly shorter than the chord on my previous devices.  The worst part is the microphone rarely picks up my voice on the first, and sometimes second, try.  I have to yell at it to recognize me.  This is extremely annoying and I never have this issue with my other Echos.  The only plus is that the sound quality when playing music seems to be as good as the Echo Plus.	3	July 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I own both the full size Echo 4th, and the Echo Dot 4th with LED Clock. I purchased two of the full size Echo 4th devices to allow for connectivity for Ring Bridge devices, notably a Ring Mailbox Sensor and a Ring Lighting Motion Sensor, both of which require either a Ring Bridge, or a Sidewalk Bridge device. This Echo device is specifically named as a recommendation. I gave it a shot, and both the mailbox sensor and the motion sensor went offline repeatedly, even when placed just a few inches from the Echo 4th Gen unit. Sometimes they came back online on their own. Sometimes they ran their batteries dead trying. I returned one of the sensors thinking I had a bad one and got the same results. When I bought a dedicated Ring Bridge, all the problems went away. Sidewalk Bridge simply isn't working and isn't reliable.As for the other features, the audio quality when listening to music or just hearing Alexa's voice is very boomy by default. I haven't tried playing with the equalizer, but really, I should be able to get decent quality from default settings.Voice recognition is hit-or-miss if you're not using Alexa as your wake word. It doesn't seem to matter much if you're facing the unit directly when you speak to it or if you're just somewhere in the room. Recognition is about the same either way, for better or worse.The unit itself is HUGE, and the audio is comparable to the Echo Dot 4th Gen, so if you're faced with a choice between the two and don't need Sidewalk, I'd recommend the Echo Dot.Lastly, the surface is covered with cloth, meaning that cleaning it isn't much of an option. I suspect that at some point, mine will look dingy enough from touching the buttons that I'll want to re-wrap it. Or maybe I should do that preemptively. Does anyone make custom skins for this thing?	3	January 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I bought this Alexa ball after realizing the marketing kings already know everything about me anyway, so might as well have this listening in. My phone, TV, and I think it must be my rug or something, already knows even what I'm thinking about.Anyway, I was hoping it could change my TV channels at least, but that involved buying another gizmo. OH --""PREMIUM SOUND"". Not sure what that means but it isn't hifi Bose quality. More like enhance AM radio.That voice ... annoying, so I changed it. It says you can change the voice, but its only male of female. And they say you can change the wake up name. There are only a couple that you can choose from a list as well. All with multiple syllables, and I want a one syllable name..like JOE... Hey Joe. So it stays Alexa with a male voice.I love the shape and look, and with the added light at the base, it looks pretty cool. It would be even better if the entire globe radiated soft pastel colors and then jumped bright red when someone is detected at the front video doorbell You could keep the yellow for when a package is delivered by Amazon.THe jokes are pretty corny. The weather report is great, and it can tell you what temperature is residing at its location. Overall use for TV is great if you have a Fire TV. It wants to go to Fire TV over ROKU or even cable. Changing cable using the Fire TV Blaster is a bit hit or miss. It doesn't respond the same to even the same command to change the channel. Overall using Alexa to control the TV is hit or miss anyway. Much easier to just use the remote.My overall assessment is that it's a cool gimmick, not really practical. That might be me though, as I'm old. A longtime tech-head, but an old one. Sometimes cool factor of a product isn't worth the bother."	3	January 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I do not like the sound quality. I get richer, clear sound with a $15 Bluetooth speaker. As for Alexa integration: it’s a useful as the Dot but getting it to work with SmartLiving isn’t going at all. It’s not very inclusive. Sooo, out of step with society. C’mon, Bezos! Get a better design team	3	September 20, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought a pair of these. A 4K fire stick and the sub. It was a bit of a challenge to get everything connected and working. The sub is decent, not super loud if that’s what you are going for. Once you connect the 2 echos with the sub you can’t change any of the sound settings individually.We listen to SiriusXM a lot and it keeps dropping the signal and going to static. Spotify works fine. Not sure why it doesn’t seem to like satellite radio. We have very strong wifi with a mesh system so it’s not a wifi issue.Overall the echos and sub combo sound good and it does the job of deleting a soundbar under my tv above my mantle. You’re not getting theater quality sound but it’s good for the price on prime days.	3	July 27, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I like almost everything about this product.Unfortunately, it announces “NOW CONNECTED TO [DEVICE NAME]” whenever you activate it.If you’re connecting this as a PC speaker be prepared to be woken up at 2am when your PC installs a random update and restarts.Research this issue online and you’ll see it has been known for years and Amazon does nothing to fix it. There are a few bandaids you can stick on like restarting the device, but none of them work over time.Absolutely stunning lack of consideration to how the thing will be used in real life. The worst part is I’m sure they could easily patch this online (other people have literally developed desktop applications to override the functionality) but they just…don’t.	3	August 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	After using this for a few weeks there's definitely more negatives about this new model.  Compared to even the Gen 1 Echo Dot, its comprehension of what you're saying or ability to even hear you on the first try is not nearly as good.  Our old Echo Dot could hear us well from the other room, this one doesn't hear us on the first try 60% of time - from only a few feet way!  I've had enough experience with family members' earlier gen Echos to know this device is also inferior to them.The ball shaped, cloth coating gets dirty VERY quickly in a kitchen environment.****November 24, 2020****I purchased this Echo due to its ability to connect with Philips Hue bulbs without a hub.  The product is new enough that Amazon tech support does not understand that the Echo 4th generation does not work with Philips Hue bulb model LWB004. I have 2 of them and spent way too long on the phone trying to sort it out.  I ended returning my new Echo and getting again with a bundle of 2 new Hue bulbs (Model 453100).  Those Hue bulbs worked immediately and easily.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.  Definitely distortion on the maximum volume that is not there in older models.The size and shape are not as problematic as I thought it would be.  It does feel like it will be prone to getting damaged by kids more than the older coffee can version of the Echo design.In the end though, it is still cheaper than an Echo Dot plus a Philips Hue Hub.  And the Echo 4th gen certainly sounds better than an Echo Dot.  Additionally,  I am one of the people who got burned by Philips shutting off access to the first generation Hub, so I am happy to not be forced into buying another Hub from them.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.

Echo 4th Gen	"Aside from the ""by the ways"" that force me to wait, here's my experience with Alexa this afternoon.I set 2 timers for a nap. After they rang, I set another 30-minute timer (I know I nap quite a bit). However, after the new timer is set, the old timer kept ringing. So I said to Alexa with my dreamy eyes, ""Alexa, turn off the alarm"" to which Alexa replied, ""there is no active alarm.""Thinking that the 30-minute timer is canceled too, I told Alexa again, ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" It replied, ""Second alarm set for 30 minutes."" Frustrated, I then told Alexa to clear all timers and set just 1 alarm for 30 minutes, to which it replied, ""Third alarm set for 30 minutes.""Not wanting three alarms to go off one after another, I asked Alexa to clear all timers. Alexa then read to me, that I have 3 active timers set, with the FIRST timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, the SECOND timer set to 30 minutes X minutes X seconds remaining, the THIRD timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, which one did I want to cancel. I said ""all of them."" Alexa then said ""timer all of them"" was not found and then hung up on me. I then had to tell it to cancel my timers again. It repeated the same information about each of the timers, which took a very long minute, and then proceeded to ask me which timer I wanted to cancel again.

Echo 4th Gen	". . . seems to have been wiped from the face of the Earth.I read the specs and thought ""why not"". So I was having problems with my Gen 2, had a conversation with Tech Support and they said that the Gen 4 was many steps ahead in many of the problem areas that I was having. SO, I traded it in (big mistake), Gen 2 and got a good price on the Gen 4. But it turned out to be the ""Alexa System"" itself and still is. I still have the same problems. If not more as things seem to be degrading. And the design of the Gen 4 doesn't help at all with salient interaction. But now I have them with the inadequacies of the Gen 4 Bowling Ball. (Whomever thought of that should be . . . )As with all the other features, they're over hyped. Including the ones that they are releasing as if it's the 12 Days of Christmas. I have too much Bass even though I have backed it off in the settings. The device rattles as if there is ""FUD"" in the speaker cavity and rattles every thing that is in the vicinity. It also distorts easily and there seems to be no common volume settings/volume leveling, I know there are settings, they don't work, across all systems that provide material. The volume seems to be doing it's own thing. I've seen this said in a couple places. Even the ""Adaptive Listening"" is the epitome of wonky. It seems to operate just the opposite for what they say. I get all my music and podcasts lower than ""She who shall not be named"" and when ""She"" chimes in, it's blaring! The ""Increased User Vocal Sensitivity Pickup"" is nothing like they profess or the Gen 2 was. I have found, so has my family, that I have yell to get it to hear me. And repeat myself a lot!! The way it's designed it has a ""Front"" that you have to be inline with or it doesn't work right. ""What happened to the guy that created this thing?!"" The Gen 2 responded to a normal talking level from 360°. ""She"" was just dumb. As they all are. The new ""Infra-Red Motion Sensing"" says that it's calibrated so that it reads things in a normal manner to avoid natural and not intentional movement. So it'll see a person when it's necessary and operate appropriately. ""So your don't have to wave your arms around in front of it"". YES YOU DO!AND with all this volume adjusting using the buttons on the top, HOW IN THE HECK DO YOU KEEP IT CLEAN?!!! I had though of putting it in a bowling ball cleaner at the lanes, but . . .There's so much just pain wrong with the whole situation in the first place that only make a half-arsed device, even more half-arseder. My Routines are no longer working completely. Sometimes they will completely fire off, to my surprise. But mostly not. Will fire off bit and pieces of a Routine if it cares. I'm having a heck of a time getting some devices to connect and once they are ""She"" snarfs them up and it's like having Double Natting in a Router. Other times I won't even be done and ""She"" says she sees it already and I haven't named it yet, so there's more work to make it right. And it doesn't always work.Oh! I have changed the voice over to the ""Male"" voice so I don't feel as bad cussing at it. But ""He's"" still dumb. Just like the ""pre-Demon"" Hemsworth in the ""Female"" version of ""GhostBusters"".Not sure what they are up to . . . I don't think they are either . . ."	2	December 25, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Great sound quality but this echo is worse at waking up on the command word than previous generations.The new inside temperature feature is cool but is often wrong (by 10+ degrees) so is somewhat unreliable.	3	September 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Not crazy about the sound.  Not as good as the older tower style. It also drops connect with web more often. I also noticed it doesn't hear as well and I have to repeat my alexa commands.	3	September 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Although it is much larger than my old Echo Dot,  the voice clarity is not nearly as good.  It sounds 'muffled"" Also, at times, it has difficulty in understanding me."	3	September 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I like that it's loud when I listen to my music. What I don't like is when the Alexa is not able to hear me or understand and it glyches out sometimes.	3	September 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Horrible mic and it’s never worked right. I called Amazon and they had me do a reset which made it work okay for about 5 mins then the same thing happened where you have to stand over the top of it to get it to hear you. For the record I have tons of these devices and most work great but this thing is junk.	3	September 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have owned every echo since their inception . And one fact is true ... amazon has done a very good job with making small improvements while keeping the costs down . This latest design is once again a minor improvement on the previous generations I own . The sound has improved a bit . Slightly more bass and treble . Still not a Sonos or a Bose ... but the cost isn’t either . So it’s a compromise . Glad they finally just included the “hub” instead of 2 separate models . The design being a sphere is up for debate . One thing that isn’t ... it’s no longer a omnidirectional speaker . It sends sound where you point it . So unfortunately you can’t bounce the sound off a wall to increase the bass like previous generations  . The look ? Meh ... kinda weird . But not a deal breaker . One complaint I have as well as others : the led indicator that lets you know it’s listening is now on the bottom . Terrible placement . You just can’t ever see it ! If it was higher or if it was much brighter perhaps . 2 things that I’m not happy about at all  : 1) like others have said ... the microphones are no longer as sensitive as other generations . My older echos almost never miss when I ask a question , even clear across the house . This one ? I very often end up screaming at it , especially when the music is playing . Even when I’m just a few feet away. It seems as though there are either less microphones or the ones on this model are not as discerning. Perhaps a software update in the future will improve this . ( note : I am not alone in my evaluation - others are having the same issue) 2)  My biggest dislike ? I purchased 2 black / charcoal echos ... and they give you white power cords with white power blocks ! White ? Seriously ? No doubt this is a cost saving measure so that they include the white ones across the board no matter what you order . But ... they are ugly as Hell ! They do not blend in at all . Hopefully they listen to all of us complaining and change this - as well as swap out our white ones for black ones . Amazon pulled a Henry Ford with the model T . You can have any color you want ... as long as it’s Black ! One last thing - terrible WiFi reception !	3	December 23, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	This seems like it would be a useful, hands-free device, but so far we're not impressed. The AI seems weak and always interested in sending us to some subscription site. The weight of the plug causes the plug to fall out of the wall socket. I assume it's Alexa trying to avoid having to deal with us :) The speaker quality is decent, but not really outstanding. It can get loud, but the bass is dull IMHO and muffles clarity at times.Anyway, if you like shouting commands at someone repeatedly (maybe you're a drill sergeant or unhappily married), then this might be a diverting toy for you. More seriously, though, if you have restricted mobility or you live alone, then this device could be a real time/effort saver if you have it hooked up to other devices in your home (e.g., lights, tv, wall thermometer). You should be aware that there is a trade off between your privacy and the detail of your personal experience. For example, Alexa will want access to your contacts if you use it for calling folks via your wifi (your internet connection). And, it wasn't so long ago that people were able to hear others' conversations and command history. BTW: This is information you can look up via your Amazon account. So, travel with caution and ask yourself whether voice commands are superior to the discretion of silently typing your searches (which are archived is a cloud unless you disable the feature). I'll update this review once I've had more experience with the device, but right now, it seems that an Apple iPad does pretty much the same things (with Siri) and video availability (though at a much greater cost).	3	December 27, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	When integrating my Ring smart LED there is an option for a 4th Generation Echo. Instead of buying the Ring Bridge I bought this instead. It’s a great Alexa - horrible bridge. Even the level 2 Ring tech support says it barley works with the Ring devices - they’re right…	3	September 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I’m a bit disappointed with the Echo device. The sound is definitely an improvement compared to the previous models. The voice recognition does not work very well in my case in addition the echo moves on my desk because of vibrations when I play loud music	3	August 27, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Alexa works great but the sound honestly sounds like it is being played from a hollow drum. Not crisp and no bass. Mediocre at best.	3	September 20, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Initially we loved bringing Alexa into our home. As time has passed, her own voice sounds very tinny and echo-ey. It randomly comes on, as though it is listening in on our conversations. I feel as though 9 times out of 10 that it asks us to repeat questions or requests, which it Did Not do in the first months of use. We keep it clean and have not changed anything in the home that would effect this. Thinking that it's just another electronic device that is made to self destruct so that you have to buy a new one.	3	July 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	General Annoyance - I bought this with the free globe offer - amazon lost it in delivery - there was no way to speak to anyone on their app so I just had to cancel it. BUT Cancelling it was difficult because it mysterious vanished from my recent orders, which seems devious as it was supposed to be a free included item - but I am hoping I am refunded its full price.PROsI new I wanted this for Spotify playing so I paid more to get the better speaker, and as I can connect it via bluetooth to my TV Soundbar /Bass it even sounds better. So overall happy but in truth I am no sound expert /musicphile.CONs- If you don't have an American accent and you want to set it to yours, you apparently lose functionality in the US but its not clear on what functionality to make it an easy choice.- I have it announce my Calendar but it does it twice. You can set the reminders to only announce once but it doesn't work for the calendar integration - its really annoying.- I like to clear up and delete my history - don't see any need for Amazon to have it. But to delete Activity you have to delete each Activity card and its like two taps. Again really annoying.- I have noticed things mysterious turn themselves on and off since setting this up. Can't tell if it's Alexa or the apps running the connected items to it. I don't see anything in Alexa history to suggest its Alexa and I haven't investigated further. i.e Xbox and lights mysteriously turn on.	3	December 9, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I traded in my Echo Premium cylinder for this device in 2020 all of a sudden, it doesn't connect any longer. Tech support refuses to replace it, and the price for my original device is 150, yet this one is 50 dollars, and you cannot trade it in. That does not make any sense whatsoever. I'd rather have my original device back. I feel like they sold me a cheap device and know it is not worth their time after letting me purchase it.Shame on Amazon for this tactic.	3	July 27, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I currently have a 2nd Gen Echo and 2 Echo Dots. I listen to the 2nd Gen Echo the most and decided to give this a try to upgrade the sound. My favorite thing about the Alexa products is being able to network them together into groups. The sound quality on this was a step up from my 2nd Gen. That is where the good stops. This device would frequently stop playback altogether. Whether it was Amazon Music, a Flash Briefing or a 3rd party app it would just stop playing. I could not get my devices to play in a group with this device as part of the network. All my devices were hooked up to the same 2.4 ghz wifi network. I deleted and re-added all the devices multiple times. I spent countless hours on the phone with support. Everything worked fine until I added in this devices. When I removed it, the groups worked fine. The last straw was when it was in the middle of delivering a severe weather notification and it just stopped working. I will stick with the older, slightly less great sounding tech because it reliable works. This is getting returned.	3	April 25, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Of course it doesn’t always do what it is supposed to do but that is technology sometimes. My main issue is that I have started noticing a static sound when playing my music. It reminds me of when a speaker is blown or real close to it. I never turn the music up loud and I don’t use it often for music either so I’m surprised at the quality. It is not even a year old. That is just a little disappointing.	3	August 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I had to buy a new, more expensive, larger, uglier Alexa device because the old one could not connect devices on a modern Wi-Fi router with 5G. She is not capable of answering almost any question, including her own model or specifications. And after a dozen tries, she still could not connect to my device. Alexa used to be far simpler, far less expensive, and work far better.Is it time to convert to Google smart home, or is that just as bad?Addition: After posting this review, Amazon Customer Service called me and was able to assist me in connecting this Echo to my devices. I have added two stars to reflect that service.I remain disappointed that I had to buy two new Echoes and devices to connect to them merely because Comcast replaced my router with a newer model. And it is still the case that this Echo provides less assistance than the older models I had.  Also, having lived with it for a few days, I have noticed that the sound quality is worse than the older models, even though it looks like it has a bigger speaker.	3	May 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"My friend said she couldn't get it to understand her. I tried speaking with a ""proper english"" accent and it worked fine. I guess it doesn't respond well to ebonics....SMH."	3	September 4, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I bought two of these during a sale and traded in my 1st and 2nd generation devices. They are solid units, but fall short in the following ways:1) Voice recognition not as good as previous generations. There are times when I attempt to wake the device up and have to shout. I was able to wake the other devices up with more of a conversational tone. There are also times when it doesn't appear to be able to process what I said, so it will just disregard everything and not say anything.2) The speaker is good, but I can see why others have complained about it not being 360. One of my devices is placed facing the dining area. When I am in the kitchen, the music does not sound as good since it is facing away from me. This was not an issue with the 2nd generation is previously replaced.3) Not a big deal, but it would be nice if they sent out a darker cord with the dark colored units. They did this previously.In the end, if your device needs to be replaced or you don't currently have one, then this is a solid device. If you have a 2nd generation (or higher), then maybe skip this one.	3	February 28, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The device itself is great, good sound. However Alexa‘s voice recognition software continues to get worse. it’s becoming more and more frustrating to deal with her.	3	September 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	UPDATE 11/19/2020The speaker doesn't pick up my voice as well as the Gen 1 echo - find myself repeating commands more frequently. I was able to connect a Philips Hue bulb and it seems to be working well as a hub - it's a nice feature. The temperature sensor seems to be working well. I'm not a fan of the lights being underneath reflecting off the surface. It's more difficult to see them and I miss the large rotating volume knob which is much more intuitive to use. It was impossible to add the new speaker to my existing speaker group - seems to be a bug of some sort with the Alexa app (iOS). I couldn't stream to the device using my Amazom Music app, also seems to be a bug of some sort with the app (iOS).ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/23/2020I was hoping the audio quality of the 4th gen was going to be better than my first gen echo. I listened to them side by side and the don't sound THAT different - not worth the cost of replacement. The new version is louder, has slightly more pronounced bass and fills the room about the same when against the wall. The sound of the new one seems unbalanced. The highs are tinny and overbearing. Mids are understated and the bass is so-so. Overall the sound is top heavy and flat.Its width takes up a lot more space, about double over the first gen. The buttons on top are kind of difficult to press - they're hard to feel without looking, shaped into small symbols instead of chunky round buttons and not that responsive. The original echo's buttons were easier to navigate without looking.I don't mind the white cable because it blends in better with the white walls.If you don't mind having 2 devices, I would suggest going with an echo dot and buying a good quality bluetooth speaker. The flexibility of taking the speaker elsewhere with you and the sound quality will be much better.	3	October 23, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is fine.Has told me hundreds of times that the only way to play specific songs is with amazon music, implying that deezer and spotify or anything other than amazon will not work on the device.Amazon should really correct this.Impossible to sign in to a hotel wifi that has its own sign in screen.Only device I have that does not connect to the wifi in my home, though it does connect to mobile hotspot.Seems to listen and record sometimes when I don't use the wake word.Usually horrible with foreign language artist recognition.Often not that intuitive with basic questions.Too bulky and heavy to be considered a good travel speaker.Mixes up accounts in my family, and will ask things like would I like to reorder medicine.Gives notifications of everything my Mom ordered for Christmas, even after I turn off notifications.Customer support is good, though if there is a problem with the device you are required to mail it to them even if you are in another country.Really the ease of use of the technology is quite unimpressive.Children like talking to alexa.The worst is setting up a new wifi, amazon should really improve this.I think my next smart speaker purchase will be a sonos or a google, because what do I have to lose?The only thing making me stay with amazon is that they allow deezer in every country I have been to so far, with google its hit or miss.Overall, I went from really enjoying Amazon smart speakers to almost dreading the experience.	2	August 23, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded from the original Alexa.  I have trouble getting sound set to good volume and hoped it was better. IT IS NOT!  This design is more difficult to adjust sound manually and does not respond as well to my voice.  I need to speak much louder.  I wish there was a way to adjust sound in smaller increments with my voice.	3	August 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Generation 4 Echo has very good musical and general sound improvement as compared with Generation 2 Echo.In our experience, Generation 4 Echo Microphones seem to have more difficulty picking up voice commands in the same exact locations perviously occupied by Generation 2 Echos.  Occasionally it takes 2-3 attempts to get 4th Gen Echos to respond as compared to Gen 2 Echo units.  We purchased three new Gen 4 Echo units and they all exhibit the same characteristic.	3	July 29, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality to me was less good than the earlier version of Echo I had planned on returning for offsetting credit. So I kept both and combined them. With that configuration, I am now obtaining what I think is good sound quality	3	August 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Where to even start... this is the worst Echo device I own.I have several generations of dots that have better sound & can hear me without me having to yell... I bought this to replace my original Echo, which was taller but (to me at least) more aesthetically pleasing all around.But the look of it is besides the point... it rarely recognizes what I have to say which never happened on any other device, & I have to yell at it- because talking to it induces ""whisper mode"" which I can say from other echo devices is usually because you are ACTUALLY whispering to the device.It's a complete failure on sound quality when playing music... and to add insult to injury, they may call the device color ""glacier white"" but it's more a ""dirty snow grey""... now onto a less significant, but equally annoying detail... why did they make this round? It's wider than my old Echo, & the material just collects dust... the whole device is truly a heinous monstrosity I can't wait to be rid of if/when they come out with another version that is no longer this shape or low quality.The only reason this gets 2 stars is because I like the thermostat feature & I got it on sale so I can't complain about its price (other than it's not worth sale price let alone full price)... I honestly don't know why Amazon created this, & I hope they go back to a device that has better sound quality and voice recognition instead of focusing on a design that is ultimately superfluous at the end of the day (not to give permission to make it any uglier, but please prioritize function over form next time!)"	2	August 2, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I have to repeat commands very often. So is the microphone bad?The circling light in the Echo interferes with sleep. Echo software does not provide a ""switch off"" all lights feature.

Echo 4th Gen	voice recognition spotty at times,, still with issues with finding the right song or version of a song even when you say the name of the song and the artist	3	August 25, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded to an echo 4 gen from an echo 2 gen and finding the 4 doesn't seem to hear me as well as the 2. Sometimes I have to repeat myself. Sometimes I'll give a command to turn on the bedroom light and it turns on the dining room light instead which is puzzling as they don't sound similar. The bass is good but music doesn't sound much better than the 2.  It's not overwhelming. I may end up resetting the 2 back up.	3	July 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	So I bought this to replace a 2nd gen echo plus with the smart home hub because I was trying to find a regular 3rd gen echo (the taller rounded one) to set up a stereo pair with but found them all discontinued. So i bought this version (renewed) and put the other echo downstairs. The sound quality is pretty good but I feel it's not as strong or has the same bass response as the original echo plus. Haven't set another echo up with it yet so I'll hold off on my audio judgements. In terms of voice recognition, this thing can't hear me calling it half the time when I'm in bed only 3 feet away, the other one was better with that. Not only can't it hear me, but half the time it doesn't respond correctly or perform the right action I request. For the price this thing should have the clock built in as a standard feature that you can disable at will. I'm going to buy the matching regular echo, but I gotta say I feel like this unit is a downgrade from my OG echo plus.	3	April 15, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	One has to bend to see if the ring color is blue at all or any color. It's not very clear. Again, wish these devices are cordless so that I can keep her anywhere such as on top of the shelf etc. Sometimes Alexa respond I don't know about that, actually earlier she might have responded correctly. So this feels weird when she says I don't know about that. I hope Alexa doesn't have memory loss 🙂	3	July 23, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	"Update: 28 Jan 2022I've really had it with this thing; it's a hot, steaming pile.  I recently went through a phase where the ring would light yellow, letting me know that there were new notifications waiting.  I'd say, ""Alexa, read my notifications,"" and the Echo would tell me that I had no notifications.  Asking a second time would usually result in success.  Then this morning, the Echo decided to shout to the world that we'd added breakfast sandwiches to our shopping list.  Mind you, I NEVER touch the volume controls -- on the device or on the app -- except to reset them when the Echo decides to shout at me.  This morning it shouted so loud that it woke two of my children on ANOTHER FLOOR.  I'm done with this piece of junk.  It's now packed away in my basement, and I've brought my Gen1 back online.----------I was an early and aggressive adopter of Echo products over the years.  I bought my Gen1 Echo during the pre-release phase, have had several Dots, and now have several Shows as bedroom alarm clocks.  So when I bought my Gen4 Echo to replace my original Gen1, I did so with great expectations.  Let me tell you how disappointed I am.The first thing I noticed was that when paired to my iPad (which sits right next to the Echo on my kitchen island), the audio frequently crackles and drops.  This was never an issue with my Gen1, and the behavior has persisted across pairing to my iPhone and two different iPads.  That makes me pretty confident that the issue is in the Echo, and not in the attached devices.The next major issue is with volume control on the Gen4.  I still haven’t figured it out.  I have tried the on-device controls and the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app, but there seems to be no logic to what volume the Echo responds to me.  I can ask Alexa for a weather report and all is fine, then a few seconds later ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, only to hear the Echo shout the response.  The Echo will announce a reminder softly, and then boom my notifications when I ask.  Adjusting and re-adjusting the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app solves the problem temporarily, but the issue resumes not long after.More recently, the Echo has started playing music after announcing reminders or playing announcements.  It wasn’t playing music before, and no one asked it to start playing music; it just does it on its own.  (This behavior was kind of funny the first few times, but now I’m getting tired of telling the Echo to stop playing music after it tells me to take out the trash or clean the guinea pig cage…)And then there’s the “spinning blue ring issue” that seems to have cropped up recently.  Frequently over the last few days, I’ve caught the Echo with the light ring illuminated blue, with a slightly brighter blue indicator spinning round and round.  It will do this for minutes at a time, stop, and then just start doing it again later.  During this time, the device is non-responsive.I never saw these issues with the Gen1, nor do my Shows seem to have so many issues.  But I’m thoroughly disappointed with the Gen4.  It truly makes me wish I had my Gen1 back.  My opinion:  Save your money and avoid this one.  Maybe the Gen5 will be better."	1	December 15, 2021	0

Echo 4th Gen	"Naturally I like being able to just say, ""Alexa, turn on the lights,"" or ""Alexa, set the heat (temperature) to ## degrees"" in order to accomplish these tasks. On these winter days, I especially like being able to turn up the heat from the comfort of my bed by invoking Alexa. But all this just increases my disappointment when Alexa just doesn't seem to get what I am requesting, even when I am taking great care to be very clear. Even worse is when Alexa appears to go on strike and just not respond to my requests at all. I dread hearing her frequent plaint, ""I'm sorry. I'm not understanding right now. Try again later."" In addition to these complaints, I have to add that Amazon is still far from the top of its game when it comes to the sound quality of its Echo devices--at least this one. If Amazon is going to tout ""premium sound,"" it should certainly do better. When Alexa speaks, she sounds as if her face is buried in a pillow, and music is by no means crisp, clear, or well balanced. What bass response there is does not make up for imbalances over the rest of the frequency range, which Alexa's equalizer function seems unable to adequately adjust. To sum up: Echo 4th Generation is still not ready for prime time."	3	January 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	A very poor “whole house” audio solution. What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough “free with Prime” music that you want to listen to, it won’t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn’t further Amazon’s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.“Whole House Audio”??? That’s a joke. It won’t let you play your own music from your phone on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play radio apps on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play audio books on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the “everywhere group”. Basically it’s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only “whole house audio” for being tied to Amazon’s pay streaming music.If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the “everywhere group”: First, it will tell you that you can’t play music on the “everywhere group” because music is already playing on another unit. But It’s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.Let’s say you’re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don’t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that has  another unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn’t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more “stuff”.So you’ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don’t expect true whole house audio and don’t expect them to work together as a group of units. All you did was purchase the “gateway drug” for Amazon’s selling machine.	2	December 22, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Not sure if it is my ears, but my Echo plus gen 1 to me,has better sound quality. Gen 4 is a bit flat, bland and sounds almost mono.However I know my eyes don't lie.This thing is more ugly in person!  Its like a throw back from the 70s.Noticed that response time is a tad slower.Did I get a defective ugly blue  orb ?Amazon,  Please bring back the cylinder design and sound quality.	3	July 15, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have one of these in my bedroom and it works out pretty well. The new one just doesn't perform as well. I request a song and she kinda plays whatever she wants. Sounds quality is not as good as the older one.	3	August 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I had purchased this Echo to replace my 1st generation Echo Plus.  The mics on the Echo plus were a little sluggish so I thought why not upgrade and move my echo plus to another part of the house that is less used.  Well the new Echo showed up a little early and I even went through the payment plan.  I thought that the new generation should have all kinds of woops and whistles than what I originally had.Well the first thing that I enjoyed was the integration of dual languages.  With me learning Spanish this I thought would be a fun feature.  Well it seams that this version has still a lot of issues.  My commands are not recognized very often.  When I try to play something from xm it just errors.  I have to use my echo show to play on the network I choose.  Now it plays fine on the new Echo but it just does not seem to take commands very well.  The spanish commands are hit and miss but right on with the echo show.Overall I am very disappointed with the replacement.  If it wasn't for my smart home features I may even consider sending it back till they can get it right.  The first and second gen plus is still very cheap and I could just replace it with that from ebay or something.(update)  So tech support reached out to me and was concerned as well.  It seems that my Echo Show is less sensitive to commands than the echo plus.  The echo plus being more sensitive, would not know how to respond if there was an extra word in the command.  As for the Language issue well it worked fine the first time the tech was listening but the second time it would not respond saying it had a limited vocab.  They will work on it.  Because they were so nice about it I told them I would update my original review to include their exceptional service.	3	June 12, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Bought for an improvement in sound over my echo dot, but the sound is not that much better.  Voice recognition is better, but the improvement does not justify the additional cost.	3	August 15, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Okay, so I have had an Echo 1st Gen with hub for about three years now.  I also have purchased several Echo Dots in that time.  I like how each sounds but I have to admit the Echo 1st Gen with hub sounds great, much better than the Dots.  I didn't and don't have a problem with it, it still sounds great and responds great.  It sounds so great I had been planning on getting a second one to go in another room for some time.  So since I kept seeing the new 4th Gen Echo advertised for around $70 I couldn't pass it up.  I read the reviews about having to repeat ""Alexa"" being an issue but I didn't realize how bad it would be until I ran into the problem myself.  I have it in my bedroom on my nightstand and you would think that no matter what position you are in it would hear you when you are lying on the bed with the speaker about a foot away.  But that's not the case, if you are facing away from the speaker you almost have to yell ""Alexa"", so that your sound bounces off one of the walls, to get a response.  And this is the case no matter where you are in the room.  You have to face the speaker to get a constant response.  I don't have that problem with the 1st Gen speaker.  If it only had only happened a couple of times I wouldn't care, but it's constant.But not all is bad about the speaker.  I know that some of the reviews mentioned about it's tone being a little too low.  I actually like the sound it puts out.  This is far better than my 1st Gen and the Dots.  After all the ranting about having to repeat my demands, the sound, at least for me, does make up for it and I do plan on buying another one to get a more stereo effect.I still don't think that it warrants four or five stars because it is a smart speaker, and if previous generations function better at performing that function, there is definitely room for improvement for this gen."	3	December 19, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	Good addition to our home for playing music. Much better sound quality than standard echo models...but not equal to other equally priced speakers. We bought at 1/2 off and at that price is a very good quality speaker. At this price, however,  should include integrated battery rather than add-on at additional cost.	3	July 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	If you like echo's this is nice EXCEPT the CHARCOAL model comes with an ULTRA WHITE power supply and cable.  The cable sticks out like a sore thumb, I just cannot walk by this with out seeing that ULTRA WHITE cable and being annoyed.  I might as well just tossed white extrension cables all over the house.It is so annoying that this will probably end up in the basement or the garage where I won't be judged when guests to my home see it.	3	July 7, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	I loved (past tense) having echos at home so this unit as an echo gets 4 stars but as a smart home hub it fails miserable and gets 1 star.I bought this unit to control smart devices at my office. At home I use smart things with echo dots all over and it works great when our echos aren’t deaf or, now suddenly, trying to advertise crap after being given a conmand (if you’re reading this Amazon I’m about to rip every Amazon device out because of that bs).At my office though I just needed a small amount of devices to control and make a few automations with and I thought this would kill 2 birds with one stone. Man was I wrong.My first complaint is everything after two days shows up as unresponsive. It still works with voice commands or in the app but you constantly have the darn thing chiming back at you to say “table warmer is unavailable please check the Alexa app or this device is offline please check the Alexa app for further information” and you can’t make it stop. Considering I’m using it in my massage studio this is beyond annoying when it blurts that out while Al client is already on the table.Routines suck too. You cannot use more than one sensor in a routine.  I wanted it to do certain things like it the door sensor opens and you detect motion turn on this this and this. No.  You can only use one either the door or the motion but not both. This hub has been out for 5 years how is it still this basic?Want to see the history of your sensors? Tough s***. You cannot see a log (at least I cannot find where and I’ve looked) of the sensor.  Did someone come into my office when I wasn’t there? Who the heck knows because I can’t see the log.  The guard thing is annoying. I just wanted what I thought was basic smart home stuff. What I got was the kindergarten version of a smart home hub.Amazon you are FAILING miserably between the Alexa advertisements and interruptions and the smart home hub. Like I mentioned earlier I’m about to rip every Amazon assistant from my home and find something better if they don’t fix it. If I ask for the weather that’s all I want. I don’t want you rambling on about a new skill I can buy or something else you can do. Just do what is ask and stop. But no it’s all about money.I used to love these things now I just find myself yelling at them because they go deaf and can’t turn on a simple light or telling it to shut up because it goes off the rails.  I have one dot in the living room that can hear EVERYTHING, I have the same versions in each room and that one dot almost never misses a beat when I ask it to do something even in other rooms. The others I can be standing two feet from and it can’t hear a truck plowing through the house to save it. In total I have 6 new dots at home and this 1 plus at work.  Thinking of just getting the home pods and being done with Amazon altogether.	1	March 1, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	No suena tan alto como promocionan, el volumen no es muy alto  y tiene muy pocos  bajos .  Grabé error.	3	August 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Overall works well with certain Alexa commands. However quite often does not respond correctly to a question or command. This one is pretty stubborn, sometimes even ignores us.	3	August 13, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Love the new features, and loved the new sound quality. However, I had to repeat myself or yell to get echo to hear me or recognize the commands. Much more so than the Gen 2 I was using previously.Since this is a work environment, and we use echo for timing - had to reinstall the Gen 2 for now.	3	July 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I find myself having to repeat myself approximately 50% of the time when asking a question and the speaker quality needs more base	3	August 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	My Alexa could not do the things it was supposed to do. Upon investigation with an Amazon representative it was discovered that my Alexa had been registered to somebody else therefore it could not link up to my different devices properly. It is my belief that this Alexa was someone else’s Amazon return that got sent to me	3	July 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The device arrived only three days ago, so I don’t have much experience or basis on which to evaluate it. It sounds good. Alexa plays stuff via other apps, so that part seems good. I’m still playing with it. (And I dislike how Amazon wants a review as soon as it’s just out of the box.)	3	July 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Doesn’t respond to hey Alexa, have to stand up close and speak Loudly.Only responding less than 45%..Disappointed, dissatisfied.Advertised as much better product.IT IS NOT !!!	3	August 8, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Update:  I rated this 4 stars, but I'm changing it to 3 for now.  I have become increasingly frustrated with it's inability to hear me.  Sometimes I have to yell so loud that the bedroom Echo responds instead of the one in the family room.  I'm seriously considering returning this one and using my old gen 1 Echo.  Either Amazon needs to improve the sensitivity or give us the ability to adjust it ourselves.I bought this to replace a gen 1 tower.  I have several echo devices around the house and liked the old cylinder.  I won’t comment on the aesthetics since that is a personal preference, but will say the new design requires a larger footprint on the table.  The base is small, but the diameter of the sphere means you can’t put anything close to the bottom of the base.  Functionally, the sound quality is much better than the gen 1 device.  I appreciate that the new design probably was necessary for that.  The new echo is much more directional.  This is good if you have it against a wall, but not if it is in the middle of the room.  The light ring at the base makes it difficult to see on a low table or if there is something on the table next to it (like a book).  I have a lot of trouble seeing if Alexa heard me.  Speaking of that...it seems Alexa is aging and has a lot more trouble hearing me than the old one did.  I find I have to talk loudly to be heard and with the light ring at the bottom, I have to be in the right position to see if she’s responding.  The built in hub was a bonus.  I have a hub from years ago, so have not made use of it yet, but will eventually try to retire the hub I have.  I like the new device, but will not be replacing any of my gen 3 dots with the new dots.  I wish they still sold the gen 3s with the clock.  I’ll wait for the next revision and see how I feel about those.	3	November 23, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	I got this using Amazon Trade-In program because the gen 1 I had was a bit funky when trying to get it to listen to commands.  So I figured that the gen 4 would be a bit better by now.  Nope, same issues.  Oh well.  At least it is a upgraded product for free.	3	July 21, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Like overall. Keeps loosing the internet where the micro doesn't and it is further from source	3	August 27, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Buttons are kinda pointless. No need for one to mute and one to unmute. Also alexa can control volume through voice control… a button to stop the music instantly may have been helpful. I love the communication feature I can send messages to home to verbally announce or display on my firetv.	3	July 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this because of the temperature sensor.The first one I received was constantly reading wrong by a few degrees, but was inconsistent - sometimes it was correct, sometimes it was high by as many as 6 degrees Fahrenheit, sometimes it was low by a degree or two.  I know this both by the feel of the room temperature and because I placed a digital thermometer six inches from the device.  Because of this inconsistency, I couldn't even just manually include an offset for my purposes (a window AC unit plugged into an IoT plug with automations to turn it on/off based on the temperature reading off the sensor).Thinking the first one was just a defective unit, I was sent a replacement... which has the exact same issue.  Clearly the sensor in this generation is just flawed and therefore should not be purchased if you plan to use the temperature readings for anything other than a very rough estimate.Everything else about the device works as-expected and it is a very cool looking unit.If I hadn't bought this specifically for the temperature sensor, I'd probably have given it four stars.  Will update this review if the readings are fixed via software update (although I image they are due to hardware issues).	2	July 26, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is disappointing. Hard to understand words and background music louder than vocal.	3	August 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	* AUDIO:  the audio coming out of this Echo is very heavy on the bass and sounds are muddled.  Not crisp, clean, clear.* BUILT-IN ZIGBEE HUB:  after unplugging the Echo (or after a power outage) Zigbee devices get disconnected and do not automatically reconnect.  It is a huge pain to have to reset and reconnect each device and redo any routines that used those devices.  I also worry about the safety and security of a smart home when devices like heaters, humidifiers, alarms, etc no longer talk to the hub or follow automated commands after after a power outage.  Hopefully this is something that Amazon can fix with a Echo software update.* TEMP SENSOR: I like that there is a temperature sensor, but unlike a standalone Zigbee temperature sensor, the temperature reading from the Echo doesn't show up when I add the Echo to the Favorites section of the Devices page in the Alexa app.  It should.  Seems fixable with an Alexa app update.* FORM FACTOR:  The spherical shape may work for smaller Echo Dots, but in the larger Echo it is not appealing.  In my room it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Reminds me of those big red bollards in front of Target stores.	3	December 14, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	During Prime Day 2021 I finally decided to upgrade all my echo devices. I was still rocking the gen 1 pringles can Alexa and hockey puck echo dots.Back in the day I heard about how the echo plus and then the 3rd gen still didn’t sound nearly as level or bassy as the first generation echo so I had been abstaining from upgrading for a while. But then the quality of the sound from the 4th gen had been one of the main features I had been hearing about so I finally decided it was time. And honestly on that front as well as the built in zigbee hub it delivers in spades. The 4th gen Echo is more than capable of shaking the entire bookshelf she’s on with just the default audio settings.However, there is one extremely frustrating aspect to the 4th gen echo, coming from a 1st gen: microphone quality and her ability to recognize when she is being spoken to.My 1st gen echo was almost too sensitive. She would wake up for anything that even vaguely sounded like “Alexa” at any volume with close to any amount of room noise. I have an oscillating fan in my living room and she could hear me over that and the TV. The new 4th gen will basically refuse to hear me unless I turn the fan off and mute the TV. And when she does recognize that I’m yelling ALEXA at her from 10 feet away, half the time she won’t pick up on the command I speak next. I bought a new echo dot the same day as the full size echo and she has no such problems. I honestly wish I had bought two dots except for the fact that the audio quality on the echo is outstanding.	3	July 13, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Firstly, I'm fully ""in"" when it comes to Amazon products. My smart home uses Alexa as a hub, fireTV products throughout, tablets, switches, plugs etc etc and not to mention various versions of Amazon Echo.With that being said I know not to expect the best of the best with anything Amazon puts out. They aren't making the top of the line product and that's perfectly fine for me.This Echo however missed the mark for me on two very important aspects sound & voice recognition. Music through this Echo is simply muffled and without substance. Yes, I've played with placement and EQ settings. It just isn't what it should be. The volume output is strong and the bass as well. There however is pitiful mid/treble range on this thing. I'd even go as far as saying my 2nd gen echo dot puts out a fuller sound than this Echo does.Additionally, the voice recognition on this system just isn't as good. I'm not sure why that is but again my earlier generation echo dots I have are more alert to my voice commands.Overall I'm disappointed. I'm no audiophile but I definitely notice the lack of quality in this speaker."	3	January 13, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I actually prefer the more balanced sound from my echo plus (2nd gen) without needing to mess with the equalizer. I also prefer the 360° sound from the echo plus. after going back-and-forth I’ve personally experienced the microphones on the echo plus pick up my voice better. in my opinion this new version just sounds a little bit louder with more bass even though they both have the exact same drivers with the exception of the new one having an extra tweeter which doesn’t really make a difference in the sound. I actually had to turn down the bass just a little because it sounded a little... messy. i’m not really sure why they completely changed the design and got rid of the 360° sound and made it a directional sound speaker instead. i’m a little confused. One more thing I noticed about the new speaker is when the volume goes up the bass goes down which is very common for all these speakers and most Bluetooth speakers but it seems especially evident in this newest version of the echo. they could’ve at least made the bluetooth option volume sync with your phone with this new version. and of course it wasn’t compatible to pair with my echo plus for stereo. ok i’m done.	2	October 23, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	It doesn't work as well or at all compared to all the previous models.	3	August 16, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Updated 3x: this device works for a while then will randomly stop listening to you and you need to manually restart them to get it to listen to you. This makes it feel more like a diy tinkering toy and less like a premium product.My device still plays music from routines so I know it is connected to the internet so this is just an Amazon issue. Very disappointing. I wish I had stuck with google or tried apple’s offering instead.Another issue I’ve found, this device consistently asks me if I want to hear about products. I want my smart home device to control my smart home, not shove marketing down my throat.Updated 2x: the device has not given me any more issues. The mic is so sensitive it hears commands coming from downstairs or even when I whisper the A word. The sound quality is muddy but becomes “normal” when you turn down the bass setting as low as possible. This makes the device sound very good. This is a great upgrade over a dot to the point where I actually enjoy listening to music on it.If you want an alexa device and don’t want to spend $200 for the studio this is the one to get.I only wish they added that light up clock on this one, then It would be perfect for me.Updated: last time I unplugged and plugged back in this device seemed to do the trick fixing the microphone sensitivity for the last week.We will see how long it lasts before I need to do this againI needed to upgrade because the echo 1 I was using had an issue where the speaker would short out so you had to unplug it and plug it back in to get the sound to work.In terms of sound and voice recognition this device is not a huge upgrade compared to the first gen echo.This device is just as good as the original with some added features like a thermometer and sonic detection and a 3.5mm out/in so you can use it as a speaker or use other speakers with it.Why this device gets 1 star is for some reason when the device has been plugged in for awhile it will stop hearing the wake word. I am unsure if it is a power saving setting or a wifi setting but the device just does not listen. The only way to fix it is to unplug and plug the device back in.This was the main reason I needed a new device in the first place so you can see how satisfied I am with the new echo.Will update the review if they fix it, until then I’ll keep using my google home mini instead	1	April 29, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	Purchased to replace the gen 1 white Echo cylinder that had its WiFi circuit fail after 4 years of daily use.Arrived and setup was easy and it did all the cylinder did , slightly  better sound as well (though fabric cover is not suited for kitchens - so amazon being back a cylinder variant as well , Of hard plastic so it can be cleaned on the outsides with a glass cleaner ).But today - day 5 of use out of the blue the music playing suddenly emitter a loud crackle sound of 1-2 seconds length. Went to investigate the noise. Again the loud crackle and then the music returned. Waited a bit and again. It was happening regularly , about 3 to 4 times a minute.  Unplugged and replugged to see if a reboot would help.  Sitting idle nothing. Asked Alexa to play music and it began playing - and again every 15-20 seconds the loud crackle if 1-2 second length.  Definite hardware failure.By the nature of it I suspect the circuits that feed the digital audio from that source in the cpu over to the digital to analog converter before it goes to the amp , is getting  the data corrupted and so what gets decode isn’t the music signal not now a random jumble of loud digital noise. Packet corruption if you will.So fails on less than a week - a computer or build flaw. Back it goes. Given others habe reported this of may be a bigger batch or systemic failure of some bad components or issue with the board design that fails after some days of use.So if you are buying one in 2022 be sure to plug it in and make use of it playing music daily for at least a few weeks so you can get a refund / exchange more easily.  Don’t leave it in the box for weeks or give it as a gift some days / weeks down the road.	1	August 21, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"This is a super handy device, but it has some reliability issues that make it iffy for the kind of lifestyle integration it seems like it'd help with. Voice recognition is a 50/50 toss-up, and while it's better at accurately recognizing words and phrases than other AI assistants, it still misses enough that important information doesn't get added to your to-do list or shopping list.I use it the most for timers, calendar reminders, task reminders, and adding things to my to-do list and shopping list hands off. Timers and task reminders work great; calendar reminders are awesome, but for some reason everything gets repeated twice even after having it set in the app to only repeat reminders once. The to-do list and shopping list feature works, but the integrations between different apps are really poor (my to-do list lets me have a dumping ground list for tasks added through the Alexa, but I have to manually sort and tag them later), and the Alexa app's features aren't strong enough that I'd be comfortable switching my lists to its platform for the ease of integration.We have two smart lights from Geeni that we use with it, and every second or third time we try to operate them through voice commands, the command fails in some way - the Echo doesn't respond even after listening to your request, or it says ""okay"" but doesn't actually operate the light until a few minutes or few tries later.We tried connecting it to our Firestick, but it was so non-functional we had a better experience just keeping them separate. HBO would routinely crash, or the sound would cut off of HBO streams, when the Echo was the speaker for the firestick; and the process of re-connecting the Echo after this happens, and clearing the Firestick app cache and relaunching things, etc. made the process miserable and unworkable.The app is very slow and hard to navigate - the paths to different features are hard to find, and you have to retrace your steps a lot to complete multiple complex actions.The audio quality is excellent, and I love using it for sleep ambience and music. However, it's very annoying to have to hear ads interfering with the experience of virtually any Alexa app you'll use, whether that's a small soundscape service or a major music platform. The best experience I have is connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play whatever I want without interruption, which is a pain, but at least then I haven't just paid for an Amazon product that still makes me listen to ads.Also, the fact that staff will have to listen to voice recordings to improve the quality of the products or that your speech is stored in the cloud at all is a huge privacy issue."	2	July 22, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Sound is good. Speaker groups, one of the main reasons I got it, are completely unreliable, no matter how I configure them.	3	August 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Bought this for 2 primary reasons:1st - audio, which is quite good for the size especially the bass, and FYI this is much larger than the previous round one.2nd - the built in temperature sensor, which turns out to be practically useless. I had pretty much no luck, even with support help, getting any Alexa Routines to utilize the built in temperature sensor, even though is recognized the sensor while creating the Routine. It also seems to go in to calibration mode often, and if you ask it the inside temperature it often tells you it’s calibrating ask later.I purchased an inexpensive stand alone temperature and humidity sensor and it works flawlessly with the Smart Life app to control a smart plug according to specific temperature conditions. I had no luck getting the Smart Life app to recognize the Echo temperature sensor at all, which may or may not be normal.As others state the voice recognition could be better, especially when playing music.	3	March 1, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	This is the worst purchase I ever made. Was having difficulty with my gen 1 and gen 2 Echo with hub. The gen 1 had no hub but worked the gen 2 had difficulty with recognizing speech and the sound was a bit tinny so I wanted an upgrade and got the gen 4 echo with 2 dot combo. The speech recognition is almost non existent the sound quality is muffled like if you covered it with a towel. We have to scream at the echo to get it to respond and 9 times out of 10 the old gen 2 will respond from 3 rooms away while the new gen 4, 1 foot away does nothing. We set it up between our recliners in the living room on a stand that is clear of obstacles and put the echo at head height when we are seated. I don't know how we could possibly make the conditions any better for the device to hear us. We were also sold a used unit without our knowledge or consent. It was still registered and paired with the previous owner from Rochester NY, and still had a unique name assigned to it from said owner. It's bad enough I'm buying Chinese junk that spies on me but I would never buy USED Chinese junk with the previous owners returned problems still attached to it.	2	June 7, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	We ordered the charcoal color which is very nice EXCEPT they shipped it with a white power cord.  I almost returned because the cord sticks out like a sore thumb.  No attention to detail in product development.	3	July 13, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I was expecting a much richer sound but it does get loud	3	August 9, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Not sure why this Echo product is hard of hearing but it is. I have an older dot thirty feet away in the bathroom that responds more than this one in a very central location of my living room + kitchen.Also, the issue with Amazon devices playing Amazon music for three songs then stopping has not been addressed for years, I even pay more for the unlimited music sub.Other than constantly yelling to get this to hear me and playing three songs….Shrugs.I expected more for what I paid for this.	3	June 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I like the idea of speaking instead of having to go to App to change what music I want to listen to!	3	July 27, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Do not buy this if you are using it with Apple Music. I'm confident it's a piece of garbage for Spotify users too. Echo is advertised to work with Apple Music. But you can only use Apple Music in specific ways.You cannot access your library! The only way to access songs in your library is by creating your own playlist. And that still does not give you access to a play a song in that playlist. You have to skip through the playlist to find the desired song. It doesn't let you play Recently Played or Recently Added either.You cannot tell Echo to play a song or an album you want to listen to! You cannot select songs or albums on your phone either. The app is bad in other ways. I wish I could just connect to bluetooth and use the Apple Music or Spotify app on my phone (like any other bluetooth speaker).DELAY is very long when using the app! Earlier today I pressed the skip button on my phone to change songs. I was able to have a short conversation with someone before the command was processed (or the song actually changed). No exaggeration. Usually the delay is shorter, but still about 5 seconds. That's still unacceptable and frustrating. You cannot skip songs without wasting lots of time.You can only tell Alexa to start the playlist, shuffle, and skip songs (waiting several seconds or sometimes minutes between songs).Volume buttons on my iPhone do not work while using Echo. I have to scroll the volume tab on the app, or use my voice to tell Alexa to quiet down. And, like switching songs, there is a LONG DELAY when you adjust volume! I found myself accidentally playing music way too loud and having to just deal with the pain and discomfort for several seconds. You cannot quickly adjust the volume!I have not been this disappointed and frustrated with a product. I am convinced this is Amazon's way of making people switch from Apple Music or Spotify to their music service. It probably works well with their streaming service. That must be why Echo is priced reasonably.Sound quality is ok for the price. It's louder than I expected. However, bass heavy music like Rap sounds distorted and generally poor. It is advertised as having ""deep bass."" Bass is really disappointing with this, even considering it's a small and affordable speaker. My smaller, lighter, wireless JBL speaker has more bass. The Echo gets much louder (with no bass).Alexa is sometimes bad at understanding commands. I said earlier, ""Alexa, play Recently Played playlist on Apple Music."" (I know this command cannot be done with the Echo.) However, instead of telling me this cannot be done, Alexa played some Apple Curated playlist that had nothing to do with my command. Music played that I don't like and I could not pause it for 5-10 seconds.All that being said, you'll be disappointed with this product. Disappointed is not a strong enough word through. This thing is intentionally designed by Amazon to frustrate people that use Apple Music and Spotify. I understand that Amazon is motivated by profit. However, profit should not come at the expense of making customers angry. This Echo was clearly built to make people so frustrated, so they switch to Amazon's music service. The majority of people use Apple Music and Spotify. They intentionally prohibit the most BASIC features so that you pay them instead of Apple or Spotify! I feel disrespected by Amazon."	1	December 26, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	Standard alexa, seems OK for most part. Big issue though, I ordered a BLACK Alexa and received one, but the cord and plug are white. So, if you are planning on trying to make this blend into an environment, it really will not.	3	July 8, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	It's OK for speech; and it'll god a basic job of playing music -- but the sound-quality is mediocre.	3	July 31, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	it's a good product sometimes it acts up in ways but overall i love the product and i think is great for a bedroom which is where mine is for music to get ready to and stuff becuase they speak we of it is actually not bad	3	July 4, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Alexa has been a real pain in the butt. I primarily use it for playing music, and many times it won't recognize what I request even when I say it over and over again. It always defaults to Amazon music or a radio station I never heard of.  Yesterday I asked it to play music from Bridgerton and it couldn't find it. ?????? I had to direct it to Spotify and that took 5 different tries.  When it finally did, I couldn't get it to change to another music type.  I told it to play classical music and it started the Bridgerton series. I find this device highly annoying and not that good.	3	May 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	This little sphere is pretty dumb.  If I say lunch, she hears launch, setting reminders is interesting, what we say and what she announces is like auto correct gone bad.  All in all, we’re going to put the old one back in the main living area and relegate the sphere to a bedroom or basement.  She’s essentially worthless.	3	June 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"If you just need someone to talk to, the Echo is perfect for you. If you want a device that will actually do what it is supposed to without randomly just forgetting how to do things it was doing literally minutes before, don't waste your money on an Echo.I purchased the Echo to act as a room thermometer since I live in a state that does not feel that central heat and air is worth providing to peasants in apartments. Worked great out of the box, so I got a bunch of the light bulbs to go with it expecting that I was about to start setting up my smart home for the future. Within a few days most of the light blubs no longer responded to voice commands, or did respond but Alexa would tell me that it is not responding. Annoying, but as it was not the thing I bought this for, it was simply an annoyance.Then the thermometer stopped working. Rather than tell me there is an issue, or provide any semblance of help, Alexa just says this feature is not supported. Well, that of course is simply not correct, but Alexa will not help you with things, she simply is a robot voice with no ability to problem solve or even perform the most basic error checking that even Windows is finally good at. So there is no arguing with her, when she says it is not supported, boom, it simply does not work anymore.So I went through the hassle of trying to figure out how to get it working again. Finally found that by removing all of the groups and lights I had added and then reset the device, the one thing I bought it for will actually work again. Great! I cant use any of the other features it has or it will kill the thermometer, but hey $50 for a thermometer is a steal. Wait... indoor thermometers are way cheaper than that. Well shoot.I then got home this evening to find that even though I have none of the other features activated, the thermometer is again ""not supported"". I work in tech support so I understand that things will not always work right out of the box, and that is reasonable. For them to randomly break with no input from the user is just a sign of a poorly made and designed product. Honestly, Bezos has all of the money now so trying to provide feedback to Amazon at this point is useless. If you have never gotten to experience their customer service, try it sometime. It is eye opening. So rather than write them a long message they will never read, it is easier to just let all of yall know what to expect.It might work, it might not, but if it doesn't you are up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Quite honestly mine is a paperweight right now. At least it cant mess that up. Not happy, 0/10 would not recommend."	1	February 9, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I've compared my new Eco's sound quality with my older Eco Dot, but could not find a difference. I don't think  that it justify's x3 price...	3	July 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I feel like I'm a fanboy of Alexa. I have Echo dot 4th gen, Echo 4th gen and Echo Plus and I love the capabilities of this smart device and the sound quality.Yesterday though, I tried pairing all of the devices so they will play together, and after trying so many different things, I got 2 devices to work, but the Echo dot just can't connect to the other 2. Not as ""Alexa play everywhere"", and not by adding it to the group in the app.Alexa also acts strangely when she doesn't understand something and just bleeps something and shuts off. If I ask a long question, she'll cut me and start operating based on half of my sentence.She never was able to answer something that is relevant to the previous thing we talked about. For example: ""Alexa, what is the tallest building"" and she would tell me ""Burj Khalifa"", I'd ask ""And what is its height"" and she wouldn't know what is ""it"", she doesn't know we just spoke about the Burj Khalifa.The thing is that its been so many years already and it seems like there is no progress in her abilities and sometimes it's seems like she gotten worse through the years.I used to be able to play ""My sleep playlist from spotify"" but now she will always look for playlists made by Spotify instead of playing the playlists I created. Even if I'll name the playlist ""sleep by me"" or some other more specific name of a playlist that isn't public on Spotify, she'll say ""Sorry , I don't know a playlist called ""Sleep by me"" even though that is exactly the name, and she's connected to my Spotify user."	1	September 6, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"Cons: it cannot Cast audio from my phone, does not work with Spotify app, Alexa app is incomprehensible, it shouts ""Now commented to XYZ!"" every time it connects to a device, it keeps flashing colors all day and night with no clear way to stop it, and setting up home theater pairing is bizarrely overcomplicated in the app.Pros: It pairs with the Fire Stick for a home theater setup and works perfectly. Alexa voice recognition is great. Audio quality is great."	2	October 25, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"The device voice recognition is very good and it helps with automations around the house.As an external speaker, the story is different.Connecting via Bluetooth: Sound quality is OK for a device this size; this was expected. The annoying ""feature"" is that it screams announcing ""PLAYING FROM JOHN's DESKTOP"", and this happens in the middle of meetings. So I decided to use it with a 3.5mm audio cable.3.5mm audio cable: The Echo has a terrible hissing noise. It is not a ground loop, it is not the cable, it is not the audio source. I just took another speaker that I have and there is zero hissing connecting it to the same power outlet, same audio source, and same 3.5 audio cable.So if you want to use the Echo as an external speaker for your laptop or cellphone, look for another device; this is not the one."	3	March 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"The Pros: It's more compact, and has a nice aesthetic look.  The sound seems a bit better than the 1st Gen, although I don't use it often for music.  It integrates flawlessly into the Alexa environment.The Cons: This is a biggie: after giving it a command, it will NOT respond to a second command right away.  It appears to need a few seconds to ""recycle."" I don't know if this is endemic to ALL Gen 4 Echos, or if it is just an issue w/ mine.  This is NOT the case with the 1st Gen Echo I had, or even the 4th Gen Dots, I have.  Had I known this beforehand, it would have been a deal killer, and I'd have simply ordered another Dot, instead."	3	April 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought three of these around the release and have regretted the purchase. We have a total of 12 Echos, Echo Shows, & Echo Dots placed throughout our home and these are the worst when it comes to communication. 2 of them replaced Echo 3rd Gens, and another was an add on to an existing TV (with 4k firestick) for better sound and since adding them to our system, we have had nothing but problems with the wrong device answering us. None of the locations changed, these were just swapped in. We noticed that these ALL LAG, and must not have the same speaker configuration as the Echo 3rd Gens because Echos two rooms away will now answer before these devices will.They do sound GREAT when they work properly, but because we already had a functioning system throughout our house, and knew the capabilities, these were/are a HUGE let down.I have tried updating them to see if that helps, but it has not.As a stand alone device these might be great, but to a family that has been using Alexas since the beginning and keeps adding for functionality around the home, we find them more of a nuisance than a help. We end up yelling at poor Alexa more than it's worth.I will note also, one is being used and is hard wired into my work from home computer, and that one lags even more... I notice when I unplug the AUX cable it seems to pick up speed, but when it is plugged in via the AUX cable to my PC it lags and is very slow to respond which in turn has the wrong device answering most times.It has all become more frustrating than helpful. Hoping that an update can help solve this matter in the future.	3	March 16, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Wasn’t the premium sound I’d expected at all	3	August 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I was surprised by how little this thing can actually do and by how un-seamless the user experience is. The biggest smart-home items I have that I wanted to connect are my robot vacuum and robot mopper, from Neato and iRobot respectively.The Alexa app has robot vacuums as a main device category, but connecting them is really difficult. For the Neato vacuum, you have to connect your Neato account to Amazon. Fair enough, except that it only works if you used the same email address for both accounts! You will have to change your Neato email address to whatever you use with Amazon. Sorry if you wanted privacy.Connecting the iRobot mopper just didn't work. You have to install the iRobot skill, then add the bot as a device, but it won't connect to my Braava Jet robot at all. There is really no way to get help with it either. Amazon can't offer support for the dozens of 3rd party devices they claim to support, and iRobot doesn't know how to get it to work either. That is a hint of a failing ecosystem.I don't have any smart lights or anything like that yet, so what's left in terms of functionality is low-level features like the flash briefing. But even this seems like it's been neglected by Amazon. Many of the news sources on offer have stopped updating, so you can add them but Alexa just says they are unavailable every time. It's really difficult to customize also. I noticed if you ask Alexa how to edit your flash briefing she gives you inaccurate directions that don't reflect the current version of the Alexa app. If you manage to figure it out, you realize you can't really add useful things to your flash briefing like air quality for your city. It seems the boundaries of the experience are quite narrow, and they are becoming more narrow as the ecosystem shrinks. This is supposed to be a flagship device for Amazon and a key part of their strategy, but the experience has atrophied badly.	1	July 20, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"My original 1st Gen Alexa finally died after nearly 8 years. So traded in for this Echo 4th Gen. It is more expensive than the dots and supposedly better sound quality. But don't believe it; mine sucks. Sound is poor and muffled. When it plays music, music can barely be heard. When Echo is speaking, it is LOUD. Also, voice-recognition sucks. ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" Alexa: ""It is 7:04pm now."" And that is when it actually hears me (I have to SHOUT). After four generations, Amazon devices have gotten worse, not better. If you have to buy, stick with the dots."	2	October 5, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Voice recognition doesn’t appear to be as good as previous generations. I’m always having to repeat myself. Pretty good otherwise.	3	July 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Nice device with pretty light band at base. Fits easily everywhere. Purchased this in order to hear music when I’m home doing things around the house, like cooking. I asked Alexa which device had the best sound quality for music and she said this one! However, a friend gave a different device to my aunt that sounds much better and I will probably buy that next. Don’t know what it is. It’s round and cylindrical, and tall. Great, balanced sound with every song I’ve ever requested from Alexa. Going to pick it out now!! It’s sounds great in the open area of our cottage in VT. Love that one! This one is good, step above the Echo Show I have for music sound. But it’s still not nearly as clear or balanced as the one I can’t name!! Sorry!	3	March 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	It sounds just like all of the other Alexa’s	3	August 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Like many other reviews, the microphone on this device is inferior to other Alexa devices. I have a basic echo and a flex device in nearby rooms, and even when I am 10 to 15 ft away from this one, the other devices will often hear me instead of this one.	3	June 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	This is my 12th echo in the house. Every one i have that is black came with a black cord. This one came with a white cord. It is clearly for a black area, smh.	3	July 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"20220508. This is an Alexa device, but it seems to have trouble recognizing when you are talking to it. I've found I have to pause after saying Alexa before I add the instruction. Even then, it often takes 4 or 5 tries to get the blue ring to light up. This behavior is consistent with both of these Echos, and with the larger version (I bought the three pack).I don't know what Amazon is doing under the covers, but I will say I've noticed a general degrading in voice recognition on other Echos, especially on the Echo Show. My guess is they have been dorking with the OS and have added too many ""features"" so that the CPU is overwhelmed and not as responsive as it once was.For example, I am now queried on a regular basis to give a rating to products I bought, and reminded that consumables I've purchased in the past might be running out. I don't need that stuff, and I would far prefer to have an Echo that is responsive and less of an ad machine for Amazon.20220511. UPDATE. Amazon called me with some suggestions for improving the response. I've made the adjustments. I will update when I've had time to see if it makes a difference. I am adding one star for Amazon following up."	2	May 8, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	This one is great for music but does not recognize our voice and requests like the dots and show we have. We have dots and another couple Alexa’s put all around our house and this one is just not as responsive. Bass is good but that’s about it.	3	June 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	What I did not like about this product is it died the we got it.	3	July 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I love Alexa’s and most echos. The house is filled with them. However this model has the worse possible sound for music. Massive bass that even using the EQ destroys any music. Mediocre mids and trebles. The previous generation was way better. What happened?	3	June 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Somehow I feel like the echo dot is better than this. Set up is so annoying too, it has a hard time connecting to internet, and it'll speak in three different languages repeatedly during this process. The shape is really odd in my opinion, and I'll have to ask it multiple times to do things too which is super annoying. The studio version is something I wish I saved for instead.	3	June 3, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"While the sound is much improved; I'd rather liked the method for which the volume was controlled in the Echo 1st Gen.  With Echo 1st Gen all you had to do was twist the top.  With the Ball 4th Gen, you have to go feeling for the +/-.  One added plus to the Alexa 4th Gen, is the battery attachment.  Today I am to receive the battery.  Let's hope it performs well.  Would I buy another 4th Gen; yeah, the sound is worth the cost.  Sure wish one could twist the upper half of the ball to adjust the volume; that would have been better.We have used the 4th Gen Alexa for 1/2 months; the only problem we have noticed is that, and I should first say; the 4th Gen is geared more toward digital devices, with that said; the problem it has is that it does not voice recognize our request to play music by ""U2.""  Its response is to direct us to enable ""youtube"" by using the Alexa app.  At the Alexa app, there isn't a method to solve this problem.  The only solution we found was to request a specific album or song from U2.  Then Alexa 4th Gen has a better chance at granting your request."	3	September 14, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	first one lasted 5 months so only 3 stars until I see if it lasts longer.  Return under warranty was a huge hassle.  Bought it on sale but reimbursement was for that price not replacement price.  Since it only lasted 5 months, should get the replacement for the price paid.  After much time on the phone with Amazon, they finally got it right.  liked the ring on the older version being on top better than this one that has it on the bottom, not a easy to see.	3	May 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I really am confused by the performance of my Echo 4th gen.My dot is working fine. I had high hopes and was excited for this one with the hub in it. I read all the reviews online and even watched people play it and compare speakers.I don't know if i got a ""lemon"" in the batches but mine has been malfunctioning repeatedly and sadly I think I have to return it :-( I'm really disappointed b/c I want an alexa device with an integrated hub and I got it at good value on a promotion.  I don't want to return it but I need it to work and now she is not responding, and when she does respond there is terrible feedback noise.Pluses:+ acts as hub+ color good+ design goodCons:- it often doesn't understand my voice from nearby and I have to ""shout"" or ""sternly"" give commands- the volume up or down doesn't always take affect and you have to repeat the command- the sound now started to get crackly and play static feedback with it - has started to ""ignore me"" and it will ligt up blue, i will say ""play jazz music"" and it doesn't do anything- i have a dot in a room nearby (but not close), and the dot will often pick up my voice in the enxt room, even though i am on the sofa sitting directly next to the hub one and the hub will not respond----update on review:amazon customer service did try to help. they are sending me a replacement one to see if it is a hardware issue on this specific device that i got. crossing fingers the new one is better.i did speak with the rep about the difference in amazon plus. vs. studio vs. 4th geninteresting to me that the echo plus 2 are still more expensive than the new 4th gen even though they are ""older"" technology.i suspect the plus 2 have the kinks worked out, wish the price would drop.and maybe some of these issues with my new 4th gen device are teething issues with it being a ""new and improved"" design and inner-parts.also an odd note on the customer service - the team that followe dup on a 2star review, they rang me and i asked to call back later. he mentioned he would email me - got the email, the instructinos said ""you can reply directly to this email"" so I took the time to reply to the email but then got the automatic response that said ""you are writing to an email that no longer accepts incoming messages"" s - so he won't see my response and the alternate contact path is to log a new ticket, which i've already done so i wont resend."	2	January 25, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	It works great as a simple Echo Dot, when it becomes to usability of the speaker capabilities it becomes almost impossible to use it, it change the volume by itself constantly, it keeps disconnecting, I contacted Amazon support and I spent an hour trying to solve the issues with no success, I need to highlight, the support team where very kind and they really tried to help.	2	October 24, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is great but then you have to deal with the constant pestering for you to upgrade to the premium package to enjoy more music. It seems every time I start to enjoy the sound quality of the device I'll ask it to play something else and it'll either tell me that song is only on the premium package and would I like to upgrade now to hear that song or I can hear the song but before I do I get asked again if I would like to get the premium package blah blah blah blah. Anyways good sound until you have to hear what alexa or what ever name you choose for your device has to say about blah blah blah.	2	September 14, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"We wanted to love this with the premium sound and we have to say, the music quality is improved over the standard model. The issue is listening and responding to or commands. This echo seems ""hard of hearing"" whether it is playing music or just waiting for interaction. Frustrating problem. We don't know if it is defective and needs to be returned or it is a design flaw. Other reviewers have also mentioned the hearing/listening problem."	3	May 31, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this item to upgrade my Echo Plus in July 2021, after two months my Phillips Hue light bulbs stopped working with the unit.  When trying to troubleshoot the issue I lost the ability to restore or add light bulbs back to the Alexa smart home network.  In working with the Amazon team, a replacement device was sent but the same issue re-occurred in December 2021, almost the same time period as the prior unit.  As a hub device that works with Zigbee devices, Phillips Hue Lights should be listed needing a hub for it to work with this unit.I am not sure if other Phillips Hue users are having the same issue, this was my experience.  I would not suggest buying this Echo if you are a Phillips Hue user unless you buy the Phillips Hue Hub.Note: I also have other smart home items and I did not have a bad experience with those items, just the Phillips Hue Lights.	3	January 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	When I saw this design I knew immediately I had to have it. It's spherical look matched the look of the spherical lamps in my living room (Ikea Fodo lamps), purchasing with the intent of moving my Echo Plus to a different room in exchange for this new model being the living room's device.Right away I noticed the sound pickup is weaker than my Echo Plus. Having used the Plus for nearly three years in the same location, I was accustomed to a specific level of voice pickup, especially when first entering my home and prompting Alexa to turn on the lights. This new model needs me to speak much louder to throw my voice enough in order for it to pickup and respond accordingly. That's strike one.Next, while I love the design and the light ring makes sense at the base for this design, I decided very early on that the placement of the light ring at the base is counterintuitive as it's difficult to impossible to see if your prompt was recognized if your vantage point is obstructed; this was not the case with the Echo Plus with it's tall cylindrical design. That's strike two.Finally, the sound quality. Thinking it would sound better than the Echo Plus was logical given the Plus model is several years old and this new model boasts more size to house a decent speaker system. Modern audio devices have really stepped up their game with rich sound and deep bass, so I assumed this would perform exceptionally. Unfortunately, I found the audio quality to fall below that of the Echo Plus. I linked all my echo devices so that music will play across all the devices to fill my home. Walking from my living room (where this new Echo lives) into my art studio (where the Echo Plus was moved to) there is an undeniable difference in sound quality, with the Echo Plus clearly being the superior in sound. This new model suffers by not adopting the 360 sound of the Plus and also sounds to have weaker bass in comparison, even after matching the audio settings to the Plus. That's strike three, which is three strikes too many.My final analysis is that this new Echo isn't much more than a larger Echo Dot with the added benefit of the hub that allows integration with Hue bulbs.I will be placing my Echo Plus back into the living room and redesignating this new model as an Auxiliary device in another part of my home. I may purchase a better quality external sound system for it, but in any case, Amazon needs to revisit the Echo with more focus on sound than the physical design because I feel some sacrifices were made to make a product look pretty.	2	December 10, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	It’s a cool concept and I don’t know if mine is defective but it loses connection a lot. I know it’s not my internet because all of my other devices are fine. It will also just randomly crank up my music with no rhyme or reason. I checked and there’s no set schedule or routine for it to do that, it just does it. It gets what I say a lot of the time but sometimes I’ll say something crystal clear and it will not understand, even through it’s a direction I’ve given it before without issue. Sometimes it randomly shuts off but my phone app shows it’s connected and there’s nothing in the settings or routine to make it do that. The routines you can set only allow one “skill” per routine which is inconvenient. It could definitely use a lot of improvement and a cool feature would be options for different celebrity voices (like how WAZE does), not having to ask Alexa to ask a specific celebrity something to get their voice. It would also be nice if, not only would it turn on my tv by voice, but if it would also launch sling or paramount + or discovery + by voice too.  Accents, celebrity voices, better connectivity, more consistency, and the ability to search all of your streaming services for a specific movie or show you ask for, as well as record them if you’d ask it to would make it worth the price. As it is, kind of a rip off. If you really want one, get the dot. The price is more inline with what you get. The concept is great but a lot of room for improvement.	2	February 20, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"A dud all around:1.  The globe shape takes up more space in every instance where it's put than its cylindrical predecessors2.  The internal temperature sensor is often inaccurate.  Apparently it updates no more often than every 30 minutes.3.  The buggy alexa app occasionally shows the echo 4 temperature on its status screen, but most of the time it doesn't display -- the temperature line is missing. Previous versions prominently displayed the temperature.4.  The temperature measures in C despite setting it to F in the alexa app.  The only way to change it is through a voice command to the echo.5.  Sound quality is markedly worse -- and is especially directional. Vocals are muffled and no amount of adjustment makes much difference.6.  The ""equalizer"" is still profoundly primitive with only three adjustment -- bass (which is already too heavy even at the lowest setting); midrange; and treble.7.  No digital signal processing?  This is 2021, not 2001.8.  The on-board processor(s) are very slow to react to commands -- and it's not related to the internet or WiFi.9.  Room speaker groups don't work -- one of the three speakers in the group will work fine and any of the three will work fine, but when asked to play in a group, two of the three speakers behave as if they have poor connections with glitchy sound that then drops in and out.  All are on the same WiFi dedicated network, and I've reset them multiple times.10.  The action light ring on the bottom is hard to see and is largely hidden by the globular shape.  The action ring is on in my image with a waiting notification -- can you see it?  Me neither.11.  There is some sort of sound-based occupancy sensor in this version of the echo -- again, doesn't work reliably, poorly documented; and poorly implemented and integrated with the buggy alexa app.12.  Still no way to interact with the echo devices using a web browser -- forced to use the buggy app.13.  Volume normalization across feeds is abominable.  Some sources, BBC World Service, for example are quiet -- others, such as the NPR feed are loud.  This should be tested before feeds are allowed to go live.  Even better, sound normalization should be automated in the cloud if not on the device.  It's maddening to be required to manually adjust the volume on EVERY SINGLE source!To say I am disappointed in these $100 duds is an understatement.I will be returning these ASAP."	1	November 16, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	"First, I could not use my desktop computer to link the echo to Alexa. I had to load the Alexa app onto my phone to do this and I do not like a lot of apps on my phone.  Second, and I'm not sure if it's because I have the volume up on the echo, the sound goes out on occasion, like a hiccup. I've tried unplugging, waiting then plugging back in, but that didn't help.  And finally, the echo seems to move across the table I have it on over several days use.  I have to keep moving it back into place.  The sound is not as good as I expected, being listed as ""premium"", but it is passable.  The unit is acceptable over all, but not exceptional or special."	3	February 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I prefer the original cylinder style Alexa. This new one sounds a little better but it is too big -  it takes up too much space. I got the battery  base because I take Alexa with me - especially when I work outside. The cylinder Alexa is super easy to carry with one hand. I need 2 hands to carry the new Alexa.  To raise or lower the volume on the original, you only have to turn the ring at the top, something you can do in the dark.  The new version has a + and - symbol on the top to raise and lower the volume, very hard to find in the dark!  This is a much poorer design.  It's like the designers went backwards instead of forwards in making the new product. I am trying to decide if I keep it or return it.	2	August 9, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"The speaker works well in a large room and we like the looks and color (blue), even though the cord is white. However, the Alexa apt is frustrating and has been since my first Echo Dot (original generation). Then, there's the Amazon Music Unlimited, which you would think would work great with the Amazon Alexa AND the Amazon Echo speakers. Well, I don't know which to blame, but here is an example: I paired my new 4th Generation Echo with my existing 1st gen. Echo Dot (in another room via the Alexa apt), then requested  an artist playlist (i.e. ""play music by Neil Diamond"") and they both worked - for a while. Then, after about six hours (which included Christmas music in March) the gen 4 Echo (mid-song) shut off while the old Echo Dot kept playing. Trying to correct the situation means: Stop Alexa, wait a while, then start over, if you're still inclined. This happens All the time when leaving on long enough. The sound volume also varies song-to-song so that I frequently manually turn the sound up or down. The sound quality is surprisingly good, otherwise. Alexa voice recognition, even after a substantial break-in period is ify: sometimes when requesting a playlist or song Alexa will want to sell me a book.Some artists play for hours and some for an hour, even though they have many more songs to their credit (i.e. Bill Medley played for one hour with three repeats of ""The Time of Our Lives""). If you have a lot of patience, have fun, but, sooner-or-later things get frustrating.Update: After contacting Amazon, a very helpful customer rep. guided me through a Factory Reset. Afterwards she promised the device would work 'perfectly'. It works worse. Now about tree hours both 4th Gen. Echo's hiss during playback then shut down with my original 1st Gen. Echo Dot still playing (on my 'everywhere' group inside our house). Then it took 6-7 attempts to get my old Echo Dot to stop. Before I purchased the two 4th Gen. Echo's, everything worked fine .. not 'perfectly', but fine. Good Luck! IF you buy these .. Still not sure if the problem is the new Echo's or Amazon Music Unlimited. Another update (4-20-21): While we do enjoy Amazon Music (when it works) and the sound is good .. the Echo is in a large room so I decided to add another for stereo and coverage .. call me stupid for still hoping for a good experience .. what convinced me to buy another (?) .. Amazon put it on sale and promised to include a free smart plug .. well, Amazon came through again and didn't include the smart plug and their customer service can't remedy. At least I got the sale price, but, I am increasingly NOT becoming a loyal Amazon customer. 6/10/21 Update: Alexa Sucks!: Frequently doesn't play what you ask for, or, when it does, stops playing, mid-song, when it wants, then freezes so you can't play any music until ""SHE"" feels like it (even doing a 'unplug' restart doesn't help). These speakers are marketed for Alexa and Amazon Music users and the experience (six months worth) is frustrating, maddening, and just plain bad."	1	March 5, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Many features and settings that are not explained at all.  I keep running into strange behavior that I must go to internet to find the answer.  One more unexplained event and I will return the device.	3	June 20, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Update November 2021: I have taken this echo out of service. Last night I ask her to play Klove radio station for me. She said I needed to get Amazons music service.  Told her to stop and tried again. She wanted to play Christmas music.  Told her to stop. Ask her what the temperature would be and she started to play Christmas music. Took her out of service. Ask my echo show to play klove for 30 minutes. Her answer was ""playing klove fromm H..... I heart radio for 30 minutes.""I think Amazon had different clouds for different echos. I have my dots be down but my show5 works fine. My dots don't argue we me like this echo does and this on is always trying to get me to buy things, a lot more than dots and shows does.Original post: I have echos from the very first one to now including echo show 5.  The sound quality is the best of all.  This new one (4th generation) has problem of hearing you and understanding you. I almost have to yell to get her to hear me and then she doesn't understand. Example. I have lights with wifi bulbs (2 different brands)  I almost always have to tell her twice to turn on or off. I have a Amazon smart plug and the same.  easy to set up and easy to get other products to work with her.Update:  I’ve changed my post from 3 Stars to 1. She’s getting more hard of hearing. She went bonkers the other night and could only do a few commands. She kept telling me that she could not connect to the internet. All others were okay. I finally unplugged her then restarted. She then told me she needed to recalibrate. That’s a new one.Update: less than a hour after posting the update Amazon customer services called and worked through the problem. The wakeup name Alexa is a corrupted file. Changing to echo made it better.  We will see if that holds. Change from 3 stars to one. Will move It to 2 stars. If it holds i will change ratings to 3 or higher.UPDATE September 30 2021:I’m going to go back to one star. Her hearing problem is getting worse. She now argues with me. I tell her to turn on plug for porch and she gives ne the definition of a porch. I must tell her two times to turn on porch. She then tells me the porch is not a command. Go to another echo same command and porch comes on.I’ve decided to remove her and put in my old first generation puck in her place. It’s does not miss a command.After reading all the reviews about her hard of hearing I ordered anyway. My advice is don’t buy this one.For information the command to turn on porch was at 4:00 am nothing was on in room to distract her. And had to give command twice and hear what a porch was."	1	July 7, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I was hoping this could be a cheaper solution for respectable surround sound for my house but the truth is that these are absolutely not the quality anyone would expect who is really looking to replace a sound system for easy plug n play wifi connected speakers. Yes they work, yes it is easy, NO these are not premium sound. Maybe they are premium in contrast to other echo devices but not comparable to other sound systems.You absolutely get what you pay for in this case…Cheap stuff yields cheap results.	2	September 28, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Bought this to replace our Echo and it’s like all of a sudden Alexa doesn’t know half of what we’re saying. Irritating.	3	July 8, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Not good at responding to voice commands at all. Bass is good, almost too good, because you miss other sounds because it’s heavy. Design is bulky and catches constant dust.Worst of all, it now makes the sound in the video attached randomly and loudly.Woke up to it this morning. Only way to stop is to unplug for a while and replug. Not sure who to call and they don’t make it easy. Guess once the warranty runs out it’s designed to be a large paperweight?Note:First review was denied. Not sure what I did wrong since they won’t tell you that part but I’m assuming it was because I compared to other products they make and sell. It was all truth and no bad language or links. So it was either that or they don’t like bad reviews on their products. People need to know this stuff to make an informed decision."	3	April 23, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Edit: Figured out the original issue, thank you reddit.  Now she works when she feels like it. Sometimes I'm 5 feet away and slowly raising my voice I get now responses to only a few moment later the TV says her name, and she starts having a conversation.  Other times she speaks quick gibberish to which my partner and I question our sanity, but mostly she throws out random facts then apologizes she's still learning. Which brings me to the next part.  She randomly dings, and blue ring glows for a few moments then done.  Totally random  and mostly at very quiet times.  Otherwise it's handy in a facts argument.I wish I could say this echo is great, or this thing sucks, but since I can’t fully use it because the Alexa App is the most discouraging, frustrating, EVIL, POS ever created! After 4 days of research I have resolved to just let the echo collect dust bunnies, and be a “think piece “ of “art”, the thinking part is Why did I buy this junk?! I have lived in the United States my entire life. My cell phone, smart TVs, and any other smart product I’ve ever own, have all been set to US English since day 1, I have never been anywhere where I’ve ordered anything to be shipped to another country. My Amazon apps, Spotify, YouTube,hulu, etc, are all set to US English. I do not own a vpn, BUT, BUT, BUT THE ALEXA APP Home Screen looks normal for me, English and everything, but try ANY link within the app, and BOOM SPANISH!! WTF?! And YES, I’ve tried everything freaking thing the internet, Amazon, geek squad, neighbor, the dog has recommended and Still royally and totally….well you know where this is going. F You Amazon App Developers you suck!	2	January 12, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I like the size but I definitely did not like the premium sound.	3	July 14, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I've had many Echo devices starting with my first when I was invited to buy a 1st gen before they went to market. I currently have 2 Echo Shows, 2 4th gen Echos, 2 Echo Dots and an Echo Auto. We've always like the Echo products...until recently. About a month ago, we went to bed and as usual  told Alexa to play our SleepyTime playlist. Sometime in the night, she stopped playing and when we tried to get the playlist going again she said she couldn't reach the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I found our internet was fine so I tried reconnecting the Echo. No matter what I tried, she would not connect. If I asked her a question, she would just reply with ""I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. The internet is not reachable. ""I even did a factory reset - still no good. Thinking it was bad, I went to Best Buy and bought another 4th gen Echo. It too too would not connect. I tried over and over - no good.  So, for kicks, I decided to use my wife's phone and her Amazon account and in the first attempt the device connected. To eliminate my phone as a problem. I opened a brand new Fire Tablet registered to me. I first updated the Alexa app and attempted to connect the 4th gen Echo to my account - no good. We've done coutless resets, but nothing works with my account. Her account, no problem. I have taken the Echo to my work and it does the same thing there as well. The problem with using my wife's account is that all of the other devices, Kasa plugs, Hue lights etc., are attached to my account. I had bought a pack of 4 Kasa plugs and they cannot attach to my account either. I can use them within the Kasa app, but cannot attach them to my Alexa account. Basically, my account is somehow damaged. I called tech support after about 10 days of trying to fix this myself. I was hung-up on twice, but eventually got someone in Echo tech support. After trying many things, even screen sharing from the new Fire tablet, the technician said that this was very unusual and should not be behaving like this. The devices register on my account, but they just won't work. She told me she and her team would need time to  investigate this issue and asked me for a good callback time for the next day. I said 5:30pm would be good. I never got the call and my devices still are not working. Through my efforts, I have eliminated my network, my phone, my tablet, the Alexa app, the Echo devices- everything but my Alexa account. I have no choice at this point but to give them a one star review until this is fixed."	1	October 20, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	So I love Alexa and most of the Alexa products.  I have the new-gen 4 to replace Gen 3 so it would have the hub.  The hub part works great.  However, when I am in the kitchen and the device is so close to me (same position as older model)  I have to yell at Alexa and wait (note; no music or anything playing) then speak the command.  In previous-gen versions, I have been able to talk at a normal volume and pace and Alexa picks up what I am saying right away.Now 1 of 2 things happen 1. I have to pause for 3 -4 seconds after saying Alex or it simply does not respond OR 2. the echo dot device in another room picks up the request and plays the response in that room.Also while it looks super nice compared to other models, the light indicator being at the bottom is almost useless.  If I have a notification I can't see the light , where when the light was at the top of the device you could see the light from a distance.  Now it's just hidden and pretty useless if you are not right on top of the unit.Also playing music on this is not nearly as loud or pronounced as previous gen models.  This sounds muted (so does the dot 4th gen) , sadly I feel like this 4th gen went down hill and not much able to be done about it if you're a alexa ecosystem. household	3	March 3, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I really wanted to like the new Echo 4.And for sound quality is actually amazing. It's on par with a much more expensive speaker.But as an Echo device, It's actually worse than my echo 3 dot was.For some reason it barely recognizes my voice. So I need to call out the command word 2 to 3 times each time to get its attention.It also has some really eonky integration issues.For example every time I use it to control my fire TV it changes the size of the fire TV buttons and I have to reset the thing.I really wanted to like this and I thought it should have been a nice upgrade when my echo three dot stopped working. But instead it's somehow inferior on all of the Alexa parts, Even though the sound quality is really good.	3	January 20, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Update: Rating changed from 4 to 3 stars. The new devices (have 2 now and am kind of regretting it) are a step up with sound quality for sure. But the microphones and voice recognition are really poor. Have to repeat commands (even simple ones like ""end timer"") many times.  Heck, the devices have a hard time picking up ""Alexa"" wake word most of the time. Haven't looked at the internals, but guessing that the physical positioning of microphones in the new ball shaped package was ""good in theory"" but just poor design. Either that or the software upgrades are anything but.And Amazon is not doing anything about the ugly white cords and adapters. Shame. The round package could be cool - if it wasn't for the ugly white only cords and adapters (and performance issues of course). It is fine with the white one we have. It might even work for the blue. But it is gosh-awful with the charcoal unit. If a person wants a dark colored smart device, it is probably in part because the location needs a dark color. Tell me again how white cords/adapters make sense?-------------------------------------------------------------------Overall the device is a step up from 2nd gen device. Sound quality much improved and reasonable for price. Voice recognition not as consistent as with 3rd gen Dots for some reason.Huge esthetics issue: only have white cords and power adapters. REALLY UGLY with dark gray/black unit. Especially bad if putting somewhere that needs dark color.Money saving deal but come on Amazon. Y’all are better than this!"	3	January 10, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	You can't hear music at all , you need to pay to hear music. YouTube is not supported by Alexa.I try to command my lights and nothing,  the blinds no .I use Google hub now	3	June 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I added this latest echo to my other 2 to get better music in my kitchen. The system is very good but there are three consistent annoyances I have with it:1. I can't stand the confirmation tone Alexa uses. I know it can't be changed (yet?) but this needs to be fixed ASAP. I'd rather nothing at all or a more pleasant tone I choose.2. When it comes to music, Alexa seems to be confused all the time. I find it very difficult to have all my speakers play at once. I have to add the phrase Everywhere or Everywhere group to my choice. Annoying at best.3. Alexa keeps moving around my system when it comes to the most rapid response time when I say the wake up word. I find this annoying as well.	3	February 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Call me an old codger, but I bought this version thinking it would do something the half priced one wouldn't/couldn't.  Maybe it does, but I haven't figured out what that is yet.  I could have had 3 Echos instead, I have 2.	3	June 9, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	Alexa Algorithm was getting worse with my 2nd/3rd gen device. But with this 4 she is horrible she can’t hear or doesn’t know s$@?!. She plays the wrong thing when she does hear me. Amazon needs to update YouTube and Apple Music Skills on the Alexa App. stereo pairing should be bluetooth capable (unless I’m missing something).Sound quality best when 2 speakers paired.	3	May 27, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I have had 3 of these along with a subwoofer for almost 2.5 years now.  All I can say is DO NOT BUY.  I mean it do not do it.  You will be sorry.  It has been nothing but a constant hassle.  Nothing works as advertised.  Even after spending hours and hours and hours of time with customer service over years and years.  There are bugs that I reported over 2 years ago that still are not fixed.  Trying to use a stereo pair, forget it.  After over 5 hours with customer service my ""Stereo Pair"" only plays with one speaker.  This is only ONE example of of the problems I have had.  I have spent hours upon hours with their customer service.  I am immensely unhappy with this hardware and software.  It is a constant battle to keep things paired and working.  Phillips Hue lights that work just fine with the Phillips Hue app don't work in Alexa.  Their customer service tries to say it's the light.  Seriously, the light works with anything other than Alexa and yet their answer is that it's the light.  Again, just one more example of many, I mean many of the issues I have had.I am not kidding when I tell you that today I had had enough.  I got so mad I took all 3 of my echo devices outside and took a hammer to them.  I am not joking.  I will go to Best Buy today and buy a couple of Google Smart Speakers.Stay away form Echo and Fire TV.  They are full of bugs that Amazon is just never going to fix."	1	July 23, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"If you're looking for QUALITY sound... much better than a Dot, not as good as a Studio.Honestly, I've owned this Dot Gen 4, the Echo Gen 4, the Echo Studio and none are really giving me what a good amp, good speakers do. A single source, stereo, even 360 degree, it just isn't happening with any Echo, Hype.Just ok sound, connectivity if not easily paired or set up, an Echo may fit your needs. Or your childs. Setting up multiple Echos for stereo pairs, the message I get, ""this device is not compatible, the proceed further ""next"", grayed out. With the Echo or the Echo Studio. But perhaps that's just me.UPDATE: HERE'S WHY I COULDN'T SET UP STEREO PAIRS between an Echo and my Studio. After a very polite and in one way helpful call(helped me set up a temp sensor Routine) with a very knowledgable Amazon tech support(thanks Chris L) about connecting Echos, Echo Studio in stereo pairs,""ONLY ALLOWS STEREO PAIRS OF LIKE DEVICES"". MEANING: NOT AN ECHO AND A STUDIO. NOT AN ECHO DOT AND AN ECHO. NOT AN ECHO STUDIO WITH AN ECHO.... LIKE DEVICES, EXACTLY. YOU CAN SET UP MULTI ROOM DEVICES THAT WILL THEN PLAY TOGETHER, NOT IN STEREO PAIRS.I'm told.WHAAAAAAT?????Temperature Sensor- a big reason to buy but it just doesn't perform, react to changes in temp fast enough to make this feature worth while. The sensor being ""in"" the Echo enclosure is heavily influenced by the enclosure temp itself(and everything inside). A big/rapid change in temp? the enclosure keeps the Echo from implementing in real time. Have a heater connected? Think this is great to turn on/off by temp? Very slow to respond to either a temp drop in the room(then it turns on the heater in a created routine) and then responds very slowly to turn the heater off when ""off"" routine temp is reached. Seems to me this is a case of an external temp sensor, not in the Echo enclosure would work much better. I tried it, just toooo slow to respond and I deleted the routines."	2	November 1, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I have 4 echos. At first they worked beautifully. I liked being able to have the same program playing on all the devices while I worked around the house. However, the last couple of weeks I can barely get one device to play.  I can’t figure out what is wrong.5/3/21 update: When I posted the above paragraph, I received a call from Amazon customer service, and was given some steps to take to correct the problem.  They are all working fine right now.  Fingers crossed.One of my favorite things to do with the Echos is to have them all play the same radio station.  As I walk around the house doing my chores, I can listen to the music wherever I am.There's lots more the echos can do.  I'm sure I have only scratched the surface.Update 5/4/21: Customer service helped me yesterday and the echoes worked fine after that.  Now I am  having intermittent problems again where one or more of my echos stop playing.  I don't know what is going on.  I am not very tech savvy and it is irksome that this keeps happening.  My echos (I have 4) worked beautifully together for the first couple of weeks and now I keep having these issues. So I am dropping my rating back to 3 stars for now until I can get this problem resolved.	3	May 2, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"As a speaker, this is pretty good.  I like the Alexa control.  But I bought it to play my CDs on a stereo and have them play throughout the house (on 4 Echo Dots).  It took a little work to play the Line-In on the Echo, but as soon as I tried to play in on the ""Everywhere"" network, it dropped the Line -In and played from from Amazon Music.  I looked on some posts and found other complaints and questions.  LINE-IN DOES NOT WORK ON ANYTHING BUT THE ECHO WITH THE CONNECTION!  Don't get this if you think it will work as the description implies.  It can play the Line-In on the Echo, and it can play music to multiple Echo speakers, but IT CAN'T DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME (and they do not say this)."	3	January 8, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I've had an Echo device since the original was in pre-order, and I got it for $100. Last year, we finally decided it had gotten old enough and traded it in for a new one. That was a mistake.The new Echo's want to be so helpful. Want some music? They'll gladly tell you all about Amazon's Music Unlimited subscription service, that just so happens is NOT included with Prime. Want to listen to the news? It'll turn on TuneIn, which'll make you listen to up to 10 minutes of commercials before actually playing the news. Want to track your Amazon purchases? It'll happily give you notifications, sometimes even without you asking or wanting them, about where your packages are.When the Echo starts blinking yellow, you're supposed to ask it what the notification is. Most of the time, it'll tell you about a Subscribe & Save item that's being delayed, or a package got delivered, etc. But sometimes, it'll recommend a book that you have absolutely no interest in.The book recommendations were my last straw. A little backstory first. As far as I can tell, out of roughly 1500 purchases I've made on Amazon in the last decade, perhaps 5 of them have been books, and none of them for me. They've all been cookbooks, or kids books, as gifts for others. So why, in the name of all that's holy, does the Echo insist on giving me notifications for random books that will be coming out? I don't want them. I don't care what they are. I have never, in the 8 years of owning an Echo, purchased a book through it. I've never asked it to read a book to me. I've never used it to play an audiobook. There is no overlap between what I've told it to do or what I've used it for, and upcoming book releases. That venn diagram is 2 circles with a mile between them. Yet, you CAN NOT disable these notifications. No amount of settings changes, or account updates, or even calling Amazon Tech Support, will remove them.I do not want book notifications. For that reason, I just bought a Homepod Mini, and I'll be returning my Echo. Maybe if Amazon updates their pushy marketing tactics, I'll get another one, but it's not likely.	1	April 10, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"So got a second gen 4 Echo and sub, and when the link up properly then they sound great. It does not always link. Sometimes just plays out of one speaker. The other issue I have with it is the voice commands for audible. You would think that since audible and Alexa are Amazon properties, they would work well together. However, I often, although asking for a certain book to continue, get the last book I listened to starting up. Then when I ask for the sleep timer to be set to 15 mins, something it does it perfect. Other times it sets a timer for 15 mins and audible shutdowns within 30 seconds. Even thought I use the same command each time ""Alexa set sleep timer for 15 mins"".  So I give it 3 stars due to issues to me that cause frustration. But over all the sound is good for a wireless setup."	3	December 14, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I see that the big ball has great reviews but I think it might be from people who have never had an Alexa device before or they strictly use this for playing music. I have had the 2nd generation Echo dot, the hockey puck looking one for over 2 years and it has worked great for talking to it and music very crisp and clear and it picks up my voice very well (hears good) and responds. Now I see this new one the 4th generation big ball with a 3 inch speaker that is supposed to give great quality sound which it does sound very good for what it is playing music but the downfall vs the 2nd generation Dot is even with the bass turned down and the treble turned up when she talks it is not crisp and clear, it has a muffled sound making it hard to hear her with any background noise like tv going at same time, so that is annoying and the big ball doesn't hear very well, sometimes not hearing what I said at all and other times she is lit up listening but not answering at all so have to ask again and again very disturbing.  I am going to keep the ball and plug in when I want music but continue to use the Echo Dot 2nd generation for all the talking to her throughout the day at least this one hears and answers back almost always and the sound for talking is so much clearer and crisp.	3	January 17, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	The main reason I bought this was for my husband. My husband has a hard time hearing when we use the TV built-in speakers especially when the show has music that is so loud it drowns out the voices. I hooked it up paired it through the Alexa app, and changed the preferred speakers to Echo, and still, the TV sound would not come out of the Echo. I called support and after she put me on hold several times, she came back and had me blue-tooth the Echo to the TV through the Settings menu. After that, the sound did come out of the Echo, but the sound quality is so quiet I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it, which made it still not as loud as the TV speakers. With the volume all the way up, Alexa is extremely loud. I called tech support again to ask if there is a way to turn down just Alexa's voice so it is not booming. There is not. One more note...Echo Alexa does not always understand commands. You have to say, Alexa, turn on FireTV...because if you say Turn on the TV, it just says that feature is not available...or something to that effect. Pretty awful. Returning it.	1	October 8, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"Sound quality is very good.  I ""downgraded"" from my Echo Show, gave it to my daughter, because the sound quality in the echo is much better.However, it has a HUGE glitch.  About 50% of the time it does not respond to the wake up word, ""Alexa"" and when it does, another 50% of the time it tells you that the device, lamp, is not connected.  However, when you tell it to turn the lamp on/off gain it will do it.Another issue I'm having is that you ask it something and it will answer something else. i.e ""Alexa what's the weather?"" Answer, ""CNN breaking news...""I thought it might have been my voice, although I've had no problems with previous echo products, so I Asked my daughter to talk to it and the same thing happened.I like the product, just wish Amazon would update the software to fix the issues."	3	December 4, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded to Amazon Music Unlimited and received HD music also. The old dots where working find but wanted to create a stereo pair with better sounding speakers. So I purchased the Echo thinking I would have a sonic experience. What has been the result is as follows. The sound is great until the stream stops. This has been a recurring problem since upgrading and purchasing the speakers. I will tell Alexa to play either my playlist or an artist and it starts out fine. Then partway into the first song it will drop out but then starts again. It will play again with no problem for a few songs and then repeat. Not the sonic experience I was looking for. I have tried on at least 3 occasions contacting Amazon and finding a fix. They have been polite but have offered no solution besides restart everything, start from scratch and disconnect the the devices and the internet and reconnect in reverse order. Nothing has worked. I have a robust connection and stream 4K regularly. I am going to reach out to Amazon one more time and if that does not provide relief I will just drop the unlimited music and give Apple a test run.	3	August 16, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Though this echo has far better sound quality than my old Echo Dot, its user interface is much worse than the Dot was. She constantly just stops interacting in the middle of skills and cannot hear or understand me anywhere near as well. I used to be pretty impressed by how well my Dot could understand me from across the room and assumed that this new Echo would be just as good if not better. Nope.I still enjoy the sound quality although it’s not as good as my Bose countertop speaker is (as I would expect). I get frustrated with this echo constantly just not responding when I talk to it or just stopping in the middle of using certain skills.	3	February 16, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Bought this to replace a 1st Gen Echo and was really disappointed. The sound quality was worse and had a hollow tone. You could correct a little with the app but never got to the quality of the original we had.Another big factor for our change was the mic on our 1st gen just wasn’t as responsive after all these years and we found ourselves always yelling at Alexa. However, when we set up this new Gen 4 Echo we found it performed worse than the original. So much so, that the Gen 4 sphere would ignore our commands while the G1 which we moved to a further room away was still picking up our commands.  I’d fault a good bit of this to placement location of the two units, as it’s a little close to a tv but I’m doing an apples to apples comparison of the two different units in the same spot under the same lifestyle home conditions.  We gave it about 14 days of testing before we gave up and decided to return.Also, I’m not sure the spherical design is really any better stylistically or practically. It seems to take up more space and having the light ring on the bottom means you can’t really tell when Alexa is actually hearing your commands.  We ended up repeating ourselves quite often because she just wasn’t acknowledging we were speaking to her. Plus from a volume control standpoint the ring can no longer provide a visual queue as you can’t see all the way around the sphere. Obviously you can ask Alexa what her setting is volume wise, but sometimes you just want to see.Lastly, we bought a blue one. It’s neat that it’s not black like all of our other echoes and dots. But, the exact shade of blue actually wasn’t that appealing once we had it in our house.  It’s almost like they couldn’t decide which shade of blue to use so they just went with blah in the end.Biggest Pro:  I like the idea of the new colors.Biggest Cons: sound quality and mic sensitivityExtra note - we did link it with the multi room sound playback and that feature was easy enough to set up and integrated our G1 Echo with this G4 Echo seamlessly.  It also pointed out more sound flaws though as the G1 outperformed in the end with providing a more dynamic and balanced room filling sound.	2	January 10, 2021	0

Echo 4th Gen	"21SEP2021: I wanted a smart device to control my home and answer my questions. Alexa on Echo uses Amazon's proprietary search engine. Google is the gold standard for search engines, in my humble opinion. Amazon's engine meets the level of aluminum; the most abundant metal on earth. The Echo device is very capable as far as the hardware is concerned. However, the software, and the search engine in particular, is junk. After 6 months, I quit. I must admit that I now own a very expensive voice activated switch system that understands me 50% of the time.19FEB2022: I am happier with Ziggy. His voice is more pleasing to my ears. I call him ""Computer"". I miss him when I'm away from home but have yet to find an affordable option so he can travel along with me. My smartphone won't keep Alexa running without quickly sucking the battery dry; even connected to power in the car. However, I am finding that the Alexa software is getting smarter and there are more skills and blueprints available now. I am hopeful that this trend will continue. Thank you devs!!"	3	September 14, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Searar is an odd shape for electronic device. It does not look modern. Audio quality is superb for the size. It’s a great idea to include the Zigby hub. However even Amazon is confused on what devices are supported to directly work with this device. I could not find sensors that reliably work with this echo fourth generation. Awara sensors don’t work, Amazons on ring sensors don’t work. It is a great product with an odd shape but Amazon still does not have the complete story on this yet. Best sensors use Seaver, but Amazon abandoned zwave in this echo. Sphere is an odd shape that does not match the modern angular/square decor. Sadly, I retuned mine.	3	February 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I have 11 of these in my house and they used to be great.  Extra beeps started to happen some months ago and now when you wake the device it beeps at you in mid-sentence (I have that setting off on all).  Also, my kitchen Echo always attempts to play all music to Sonos, which I have disconnected (including the skill) more than 1 year ago. When it can't it errors and doesn't play any music at all. I have replaced the device with a new one and the new one does the same. The other devices do not do this Sonos attempt. Also, when I give a command 75% of the time the devices continue to talk about other subjects (""By the way....""). This is really awful.  There are other issues, but these are really annoying and fairly new (last year or so)"	3	December 12, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I just upgraded my five Echo gen 1 to gen 4. Sound quality is much better but amazon music unlimited doesn't work with multi room listening. It will work for 5 to 20 minutes then start glitching out badly. It worked fine with my gen 1 units. Pandora works fine. Tech support can't  figure out what is wrong i have spent quite awhile on the phone with them. I think it has to do with HD audio streaming to multi rooms but im told there is no way to turn off HD audio to the echos. If they fix the issue down the road Ill be very happy with the upgrade and would give 5 stars. Until then I am paying monthly for Music unlimited and tell Alexa to play from pandora whenever I want multi room music.	3	December 30, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"When you buy this product it's weight and circular design makes it not stable at all. It does have a screw in adapter on the bottom that some sort of stand can be inserted but associate did not mention nor was there anything written on the box it comes in to let you know and no ""stands"" near product to sell. Alexa at times does not get right response from your requests and has already fallen twice off a chair when using outside."	2	September 19, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	The sound is good, and when it works it’s good. But this thing is so temperamental. When playing music via either Amazon prime, or Apple Music (the source does not matter), it will just stop. Sometimes several minutes in, sometime 40 seconds into the first song. It’s not an internet issue as other devices are fine, and there is no internet drop. I’ve also had it just start playing one song on loop. I also have it connected to fire TV so I can watch tv with sound coming out of the echo. It works, but again there are so many bugs. Often the remote becomes i operative and echo becomes unresponsive. Sometimes randomly their is just no sound and instead fire tv plays sound out of the tv speakers instead. And then randomly, echo will turn the tv on, when nothing is playing or requested. It’s so buggy that I’m about to throw it away. I have some other Alexa devices, Including a really early version before the echo dots (without built in speaker). One is in my garage and I have it plugged into an old stereo for sound. It works perfectly, streaming same music sources. So it’s not an internet connection issue. This echo is just not good software. These issues are all over google, and the answer is simply to have to unplug it and wait to reconnect to reset it. Doing this several times a day is not acceptable.	2	January 24, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I use other speakers for sound so that isn’t a thing to me.  We do use it constantly for our curtains, lights, fans, etc.  The white cord is ridiculous.  The form factor is neat but makes the blue light more difficult to see.Setup was difficult.  It glitched on the first go and so the app kept looping to “setup your new echo device despite having set it up 5 times.  I reset it and started over. The light now lights up.It doesn’t hear me any better or get the commands correct more frequently than the previous generation.  I constantly get “x device doesn’t support that” followed by the command being carried out the next time I say it.  It integrates horribly with my firetv stick (so did the previous generation) where “launch Hulu on firetv” gives me a 50/50 split of “that skill is not enabled” and “launching Hulu on firetv”.I have 3 alexas in 3 different rooms spanning about 2000 square feet.  The microphones are too good so more often than not 2/3 of them hear the wake word and (I guess?) assume the other one will follow out the command so neither does it.  The new Alexa asked me yesterday if I was talking to it or a different Alexa.  I corrected it but it hasn’t helped anything.The only positive here is that when it gets a command right, specifically with SmartThings, it is a little faster.Our echo does not sit directly under the tv.  It would be neat if the echo would work for as read sound or atmos sound for your tv.  It does not.  It will only work as a tv speaker with our firetv stick which means the sound comes out from a weird place in our room.*****Update****. It’s garbage.  I have to yell for it to hear me and when it does, it ignores my command or gets it completely wrong;  “I’m sorry, X device doesn’t support that” randomly only to work perfectly the next time.  The microphone is worse than the firetv cubes by 10.  The old microphone was so much better.  If I could return this I would.  If you want better sound get an Echo Studio or SONOS instead.Update 2: If I wasn’t so lazy I’d go find our old one in the basement.  This thing doesn’t hear me, ignores me…seems to hear me then ignores me.  What the heck happened here?  Who thought this was a good idea?  How is this 5 stars?Space heaters and fans defeat this. Worried about Alexa hearing your conversations? Just turn on your ceiling fan or a space heater.  FYI- The Sonos/Alexa in our garage works with 2 industrial fans blowing at high speed 4 ft away from it.	1	October 25, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	"This is not a premium speaker by any stretch of the imagination. The microphone is not good at all. It takes a few shouts to get it to know I'm speaking to it, and then it doesn't hear any of us clearly (our shopping list os now a guessing game) **And the fact that Amazon CALLED MY HOUSE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT without warning and sent me an email to ""talk about my review"" was very off-putting to say the least."	2	September 17, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	What a waste of money. I upgraded from a 2nd gen dot when Amazon offered me a good price on this one.  I waited weeks for delivery only to be charged the full price and received a device that seems to be deaf and lazy.  At least once or twice a day Alexa ignores my voice (it sits maybe 3 ft from my office desk) and randomly quits playing in the middle of a song.  No break in wifi, no interruption other than she just doesn't feel like doing it anymore.Total ripoff.	3	April 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	No matter what I did, it would only set up connecting to my Sonos Arc. So I had to put my echo 2nd gen back in my bedroom and return the echo 4th gen. It was nice looking I can't comment on sound because it would only play stuff through my Sonos Arc which sounds very good. But I wasn't willing to spend $99 for something that would only alert me of packages being delivered. All of the other sounds timers and alarms would go through the Sonos Arc which it does by itself. I am disabled I can't fight with these devices to make them work correctly.	3	March 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I don't have a lot of expectations of Alexia. What the Echo Gen 4 does well, it does well. However, when it fails, it does so fantastically. My biggest complaint is that I get it, Echo, Amazon product, Echo is really just a way to drive and direct traffic, particularly consumer traffic to Amazon, but for God's sake it gets a little... unwelcomingly forceful about it sometimes.Build quality of the unit is good.The sound quality is okay. Stereo speakers could be configured a tiny bit better to try to get a little more spread out of them but really nothing can really be done when you cram a left and right channel so close together. Bass, is... bassy. The midrange is okay and the treble is fairly clear without getting too tinny. Voice recognition is okay, when you call her, 95% of the time she hears you.However....This is the real issue. Alexia isn't so good at understanding what you are asking her/of her. Sometimes the results are humorous, but over time that novelty wears off and it just gets irritating.Also... The search engine is BING??? BING??? Really??? Why?!?!?!? Who actually uses BING?!?!?!Hey pssst... Amazon, one word... Google.Integration to lighting systems good. No real complaints there except when Alexia decides to randomly poo the bed because she can't understand what you are asking of her.	3	May 24, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I was looking forward for the new 4th generation Alexa: promised better sound, better home integration, nice looking!  I bought the device to replace my 2nd generation Alexa device that we use in the kitchen/breakfast area.The device does have better sound playback overall. We use it primary for music.  But the device has several issues that make it worse than our ""old"" Alexa: (1) there seems to be a problem with the microphone. It does not capture the voice commands as good as the old device.  Sometimes we have to raise our voice so loud that the ""old"" alexa responds (and she is at the loft at the second floor!).  Most of the times, the commands do not come as intended.  I can hear from the playback of the commands in the history page that they are not as crisp as the ones recorded in the old device. (2) the smarthome integration embedded in the new alexa fights with our current smarthings hub all the time.  When scanning the sensors we see duplicates for most of them: one from the smarthing hub and another one from the alexa device.  Deleting the ones from alexa builtin smarthome hub fixes the issue.  The new alexa does have a better sound, but we resorted on swaping it for our ""old"" alexa instead and move the new alexa to the second floor, where it is rarely used."	3	February 6, 2021	1

Echo 4th Gen	"Upgraded from a Echo Dot 3rd gen and I was hoping for better sound. I got way better sound over the Dot. It sounds so much better. I got a free ring light that uses this model as a hub and so far it has worked great together. Works fast when charging light settings.I also hit a few issues that seem like issues with this model. One issue that I have over the my Echo Dot is with Bluetooth. When connected it works great and never disconnects but the fight to get this echo to see my phone is a struggle. Saying ""Connect to my phone"" works rarely. On my Echo Dot its works more around 95% of the time. Once connected though there are no issues with sound or dropping. Second issue is that it seems harder to get it to respond to ""Alexa"". I end up saying it over and over getting louder each time till I feel like I'm yelling at it. Since its 2 feet away on my desk this seems a bit strange. Again the Echo Dot didn't have this issue.Edit: After using it more my Bluetooth issues are worse. I don't now if it's a hardware or software issue but I'm thinking of returning it now."	3	June 25, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I had a first generation Echo that I exchanged to get this new echo. To my disappointment this one doesn’t listen well AT ALL. The sound quality it top notch, but her voice recognition and listening is terribly sub par.I’ve used it in 3 different spaces and that has made little difference. The only time she responds consistently is when I’m within 4 feet or really yell.In fact, my two echo dots ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE respond more consistently to me than this one does. I was literally 10 feet away from this echo and asked it to set a timer and both of my other echos (which have walls and hallways between me and them) responded to me and the one that had a clear line of sight and sound, didn’t even engage.If you’re looking for excellent sound, this will get the job done. If you’re looking for another child that doesn’t listen and often misunderstands what you said, this will also get the job done.I’d get the smaller echo dot clock before I’d get this, if my mom or grandma were to ask my opinion.	1	October 2, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I've owned Echos since the original Echo Dot.  3rd Gen Echo had better microphone pickup I guess.  If it hears me at all while I'm facing away from the little gray ball of frustration it often gets what I say wrong.  Maybe it is a good thing that Alexa is losing her hearing in her old digital age.  At least I'm less worried about digital spying by Amazon.  Though it could just be a ploy.	2	September 10, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	First of all why is it that my friends can ask the google assistant on their phone the same exact question that I ask Alexa and they get an in depth thorough response and i get nothing. Or i have to go find and download some skill in order to make her more knowledgeable on something when google is capable of finding the answer and reading it. I have the same problem with Siri on my iPhone, Siri and Alexa are both idiots in my opinion and rarely do they actually do what I ask or answer a random question i have like google does. I wish i had realized this sooner and ordered a google home device speaker or something other that Alexa. I love the ability to play pretty much whatever music i ask but that comes with a music subscription and that's the speakers job so again nothing really to brag about.	3	October 30, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I echo (ha) the sentiments of other reviews. For whatever reason, the microphone really struggled with me. Commands like ""Alexa, lights at 20% brightness"" or even ""Alexa, lights on"" often failed to register. And when they did, there were often multi second delays. I recently switched to the echo studio for the sound quality, and was surprised with its responsiveness in contrast to the gen 4. It barely drops commands and processes stuff swiftly, despite lacking the newer processor and other tech in the gen 4.As for the sound, well that part's subjective. I wasn't very into how bassy the tuning was, and how much audio processing there seemed to be. YMMV.I'm glad I didn't give up with the echo after my bad experience with the gen 4. Even my brief experience with the echo studio has painted clearly that Alexa is a capable and fast assistant-gen 4 just seems to be a poor hardware to support it. And judging by the recent barrage of low scoring reviews, I'm not alone."	2	May 7, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Plain and simple - this model starts talking when I don’t call for it, doesn’t do what I ask when I do call for it. It’s like it does not understand human voices or something. I traded up to get better sound and overall functionality, but it ended up being a level down from an old echo dot it replaced. Waste of money.	3	May 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I wouldn't buy any echo device again.  I have 4, one is this model. All of them are very glitchy about when they work. Sometimes alexa says it will play music and then nothing happens,  mostly it plays something completely different than what you say. It's so frustrating to have purchased something that works so terribly.  It got worse and worse as time goes on, I've had almost 2 months now and my window to return is over. I do not recommend purchasing an echo device.	2	September 1, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Wish for the price, it would respond better than the other echo devices. It's the worst. This is in my kitchen, it spends most it's time giving long winded definitions to words, instead of just giving the weather or playing music. It's a gift best for people who annoy you.	3	May 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Seems that Alexa's hearing problem is how she recognizes her name. If your voice does not sound very close to how you said her name when you trained her to hear you she does not respond. Re training your voice may help just keep in mind that when you do the training try to pronounce her name at different pitches and volumes so she recognizes you more. It helped me out some but not perfectly.  I think the microphones are under her felt covering making it a little harder for her to hear the correct pronunciation of her own name. That's my best guess.Ok I love Alexa devices. I have 6 various devices in my home.  But this newer echo does not impress me. First of all the voice recognition for me is terrible. I don't know where they hid the microphones but it rarely hears me and it sits about 3ft from me. The earlier version does a better job so much so that i put the last edition near me and the new one out in living room. The new one seems to hear better when farther away from you.As for the sound i like the 360 sound much better that the new directional front facing sound in the new echo. The new echo does have better mid range but the 360 just sounds better it the place i put it.	3	December 28, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	Ordered the new Echo and it is much larger than expected. It's larger than a softball and not nearly as sleek as previous Echo units. It is VERY obvious in the room. The overall sound is much improved and its voice recognition seems on par with other Alexa devices. It has repeatedly disappointed me with its seeming inability to play Spotify playlists when specifically requested. Unlike previous Echo devices, it also seems unable to be used as a playback device from within Spotify, as the phone app continuously tries to connect with the Echo to no avail. Meanwhile, the music plays from my phone and all the other Echo devices that I own - from 1st-gen Echo to last-gen Dot - are available and ready to play the music. Just in the wrong room. A disappointment.	3	November 29, 2021	1

Echo 4th Gen	This is the third Echo we have owned. The other two are second generation ones. Those two are awesome and have just been moved to other areas of the house. This echo is by far the worst. Imagine having a bot that is like an unruly child. Never listening. Always having to have instructions repeated three or four times. You can stand two feet from this device and clearly annunciate your request and nothing. It will light up to its name but then it fails to do anything. Meanwhile devices in entirely different areas of the house spring into action. On the off chance this one actually responds be prepared for a wait of 30-60 seconds before it does anything. I am almost at a point of kicking this aptly shaped ball of electronic failures to the curb. Rubbish. Absolute rubbish.	3	November 28, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	So I bought this thinking Alexa would be able to easily integrate into my lights and for questions. But to be quite honest I'm mostly disappointed. I'll ask her questions and I get a lot of I'm not sure of that one. Or I don't know how to do that. Especially when I connected my lights she said lights are unable to turn off when they are clearly smart lights specifically designed for Alexa. It's quite frustrating.	3	April 15, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	You will be repeating yourself alot to get this devices attention.  The sound quality is just about OK. The only positive I can find, is that I didn't pay full price for it	2	October 17, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Works well for a smaller bedroom but can have trouble hearing your voice if you call Alexa in a lower normal voice.Alexa definately needs YouTube music integration. I already had playlists set up and feel like I'm being forced to use other apps like Amazon music unlimited to have the same access.Bluetooth works fine for music but would be nice for it to have low latency bt features so you can use the good audio quality for an alternate tv audio source without the delay when watching a movie or show.Pretty satisfied but I think this should have been no more than 49.99.	3	January 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The awesome sound of this new Echo is perfection. The audio is superb. That being said, all the reviews about the “new” microphone sensitivity are true. The mic is awful.

Echo 4th Gen	I don’t want my “smart device” to do anything except what I ask.  If I ask it for the current outside temperature, just give me the temperature.  I don’t need a “by the way, I can also help you with ____”.  This terrible feature can’t be turned off and is so frustrating it makes me just not want to use the device as it happens way too often.  Also the sound quality is ok except the bass is way too high.  Even with the bass turned all the way down it’s too much bass!  I feel guilty playing music in my apartment building because I feel like my neighbors can hear it.	2	July 23, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	My old Echo Dot second generation had a clearer sound and better voice recognition than this model. I thought it would improve with some equalizer tweaks but it was just okay and only stays for a minute.Voice recognition only is successful if I am standing within 5-6 feet or if I yell.I need to see if I can get my old one back or new model or I don’t know. I’m sure Amazon will help me figure this out.	2	August 23, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	We have echo's all over the house.  Used them for years.  Our primary echo is in the kitchen which can be heard in the dining and living rooms.  Reading that the sound quality was so good, we decided to try this.  Well first, we didn't really like the looks.  Hard plastic rounded up the back and just not that good looking.  I know that is a personal choice.Now, if you are buying this for great louder sound, for anyone that has used echo's before, you know a echo remote is great for speaking to it and controlling the volume.The echo remote does not function on this and 4th gen devices which means we have to yell at the echo to try and do anything.  This is not only annoying and most of the time doesn't hear us but the loud requests are heard all over the house which lights up all the other echo devices.If you are close and want to control it manually, it sounds great but a little expensive.We sent it back and going for a 3rd gen echo but currently having problems with the echo remote on these devices.  If we want to use the remote we may have to  go back to our 2nd gen echo.	3	January 22, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this as an upgrade for the hockey puck I had that never heard me. This one does have better sound but I think it hears me even less.

Echo 4th Gen	I just unboxed my 4th gen Echo an hour ago. I ordered the Charcoal color because it will sit on top of my home theater’s BLACK subwoofer. The first thing I noticed was that the charger and cord are white! That’s going to look just great snaking across the top of the subwoofer!!!I have places in my home where I want white devices with white cords but sometimes I need a black device with a black cord. What ever happened to “The customer is always right?” Would giving us a choice be such a hardship?My white 2020 Echo Show 5 came with a white cord. Perfect. My black 2018 Echo Spot came with a black cord. Perfect. My black 2016 1st Gen Echo came with a black cord. Perfect. How was I to know that all of a sudden Amazon was going to turn into Apple and make nothing but white adapters and cords?And on top of everything, I can’t even swap cords with one of my other devices because the little proprietary plugs are different sizes!You can see I’m pretty deep into Echo land but my brother just got a Google device which he says is great. And then there’s the fact of my iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air and Apple Watch. Maybe there are HomePods in my future?	3	December 13, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	After having use this device for about a year it stopped  connecting to Amazon servers.  After several hours of attempting the various fixes shown on the web to reconnect Internet, I contacted Amazon the following day and discovered that Amazon had without notice or consent transferred my device serial number to an unrelated persons account making the device unusable for me. Over the past several days I have tried to get a response to fix this or simply send a new device but Amazon has yet to contact me back with a solution.  Obviously that’s the problem because it makes the device completely unusable. But it also raises legitimate security and privacy concerns about how a device could be transferred to another account and why there was no process for providing notification and consent to approve such transfer. This seems to be a serious problem, that concerns me given that I have numerous Amazon devices.I encourage other customers to ask questions regarding their security and ability to protect the devices from being transferred before they purchase.  I will update if Amazon solves this problem and identifies how it happened.	2	March 6, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I'm elated with this product. The sound quality is a remarkable improvement over the third generation ""dots."" However, after the first week of continuous use (I keep Alexa busy!), here are some things I noticed, all of which don't spoil my experience with this device.--The microphone to alert Alexa is near the base. So trying to make a request from above the device will not get a reply. This dot is placed by my bedside, but I've elevated it on two books, to make the microphone easily usable.--For those of us who are unable to use a hand-held device, we can't change the settings with any available app for computers--there apparently aren''t any--so we'll use this dot in ""default"" settings. So when I try to bring some music to a dot in one room (I have three third-generation dots besides this ""advanced"" dot), I get an offer by Alexa to switch the music from one device in another room, to the device I'm making the request from, but it never works--either Alexa turns the music off in the other room, or she's unable to turn it off, but nonetheless, I get no music from the dot I'm closest to! So I'm downgrading this to three dots--If the engineers can make an app for computers, I'll raise the rating accordingly."	3	January 14, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Good sound quality	3	June 15, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Hi, my name is klaw. I am fine, how are you?I'm returning the echos i bought. They arrived not but an hour ago. Futility is the mantra when it comes to the set up and pairing of these two thingies. The end result is no device pairing and an hour of wasted time.  Time which probably would have been more enjoyably spent staring at the wall. Try wall staring if you have not!! It's much more enjoyable than trying to set up echos! lol. Imho, the echo is horrible.Please pass this feedback on to the manufacturer: ""The echo is a LAME, and intolerable device whose insolence should not be tolerated. It is a de-evolutionary system and therefore a total step back from previous versions. I am returning both echos i bought after an hour of futility spent attempting to set them up. You should abandon this version and give them away gratis to people who enjoy bad technology.""Note to potential  echo buyers out there: If you are into music and are desirous of a new system, do yourself a favor and buy yourself a sonos. Or multiple soni (sp?) I already have sonos and the set up is a breeze.  It's like uncorking a bottle and watching spellbound as Barbara Eden floats out. Truth.I was lured into trying this ""next gen"" echo because of the bargain basement pricing. There is a reason for this. An hour of my billable time is far more valuable than the price of the echo, and since I'm in the tech industry for a living, I don't need the aggravation of battling yet another system in my spare time.These speakers should deploy and set up almost ""automagically"" since they have the weighty support of Amazon's legions of engineers to back up the design. This is not the case. These speakers should bear a big red label reading ""Warning Lame Tech Inside. Proceed at your own risk. Perhaps you would be better off staring at the wall.""Thank you.This has been a public service announcement."	1	February 9, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"They design a device to look aesthetically pleasing to the eye as it sits on your counter or table. And then they send your Charcoal or Twilight Blue device with a white power cord. Pretty unbelievable that they did not color match the cord, especially since it needs to remain plugged in 100% of the time. Really disappointed. Returning three of these tomorrow. Google Home, here I come.FOLLOW UP - So I got a quick call and email from Amazon. But their response was even more disappointing. Here's the email:Hello, My name is Christian and I’m from Amazon’s Technical Support team. I'm sorry to hear about the issue/s experienced with your 4th Gen Echo, which prompted you to leave a critical review on Amazon.com. I tried to reach you over the phone, but unfortunately we didn't connect.  I understand you're rather concerned about the aesthetics of the white power cord. This was an intentional decision that we made so that the power cord could more easily blend in with white background (think drywall, etc.). Since we'd still like to offer you some options, you're free to purchase a replacement power adapter in black at the link below (your model takes 30 watts): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S8K1RPWhat a load of crap - This ""think drywall"" rationale makes sense if you have drywall that is painted white, which I can tell you, no one in the northeastern United States has. Amazon made the decision to throw a white cord in every box to save money on the non-white devices and/or get people to shell out another $20 for the color cord that should have been in the box. Really disappointing from Amazon and really shortsighted.2ND UPDATE - So, Amazon dropped the price on these by $30.00. I bought three of them, so I decide to stick with the Alexas despite the cord issue on the black. I call to get a price adjustment. Nope, you have to return all three and buy three new ones. Clearly Amazon is hoping this will be an impediment to customers trying to get the lower price. I say, that makes no sense because Amazon is going to have to eat additional shipping plus reboxing. Sales rep tells me, they have to do it that way because there are only so many at the sales price. Another customer service line of crap. So, in theory, they are going to take my $100 Alexas, put them on the side and sell them only after the sale. Doubtful.Overall, good product for the money. But terrible job by Amazon."	1	November 18, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	I now have 3 of these. That's right, I didn't learn my lesson after the first one!As for the sound, it is good. The bass is deeper than my old echo and sounds a bit over processed, but it's fine. I can easily listen to music which is what I use the Echo for primarily.As for the microphone, like others have stated, it is horrible!!! My son has an Echo dot in his room. We had the Echo 2nd gen in our bedroom. There are times I will be standing next to the 4th gen slowly screaming at it. It will just spin, stop, spin, stop, and then play something totally incorrect. I will walk into my bedroom on the other side of the house and my 2nd gen will be doing exactly what I was trying to get this one to do! It does okay in totally silent rooms. As soon as there is any sound at all, good luck!	3	September 9, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I’ve had an Echo Dot for a little over a year with little trouble. I recently upgraded to the Echo for the premium sound. After about a month I’m quite disappointed. Voice recognition is not nearly as accurate as the Dot. It comes on without a wake up more often than the Dot. Does not understand requests as accurately as the Dot and starts playing random music when asking it an unrelated question. I literally almost smashed it once because it WOULD NOT listen to anything I was asking, it would just say,”Ok, here’s music by____”.  The ONLY advantage of the Echo over the Dot is the sound is slightly better but not $50 better. Overall the Echo should not sell for more than $50-60.	3	December 3, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this for one reason only--to listen to music--specifically Amazon music.  You'd think that was a no brainer, I mean Amazon Echo, Amazon Music, what could go wrong?  I AirPlayed Amazon music for years through my Apple TV, until Apple dropped the Toslink connection from the 4K TV, making it impossible to play it directly through my receiver without having to turn on my TV.  Amazon has this on sale, so why not give it a try? 20 minutes--that's about all I can get from the echo before it decides to stop playing and I have to reboot the echo by unplugging and re-plugging the power cable.--I can't even get Alexa to reboot herself.  I bought a sound bar with HDMI passthrough and went back to Apple TV.  I guess if you want to have a conversation with Alexa, maybe this is the device for you.  C'mon Jeff, you guys can do better than this.	3	September 12, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Still trying to program.	3	June 13, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	For some reason every so often it has a high pitched e buzz and I have to unplug it for a bit. Then I plug it back in and it’s fine for awhile	3	May 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Impressive sound but Alexa has to be the absolute worst voice assistant out there. I subscribe to Amazon music but for some reason when I request songs from my library it either plays Iheart radio or I truly have to be excessively specific. Even then it's hit or miss. Great sound worst voice recognition on the market.	3	April 20, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Delivery was slow especially when I could buy at Best Buy but couldn’t get a timely delivery from Amazon! Voice recognition is not the best.  You have to line up to the device and also be fairly close.  Sound is a little (tenny) sounding.  I think the sound is better on my original Echo  version1.	3	April 12, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	So after trying them all, I've decided to return both the new 4th Gen Alexa Dot, the bigger Alexa Echo (in red), and all the smart bulbs in white (boring). My 3rd Gen dots are fantastic, and they're plugged into Edifier speakers, so there's literally nothing new or better for me in the 4th Gen. (Except red spheres are mod and cool.)Plus the new ones, especially the dot, are hard of hearing. And the dot is twice as large (vertically) as it was before, so I'll keep the 3rd Gen one I keep in my suitcase for dog sitting stayovers too. And the 4th Gen don't seem to have good audio jacks, because my Edifiers only play out one speaker, but work fine with the same cable on my 3rd Gen Dot.I did however upgrade my mood lights in my room with RGB smart bulbs, so now I can go purple or whatever color I want. In theory, I could program them to change hue according to the temperature outside, or the price of corn.I also saw that there's a battery base for the 3rd Gen dot, so I'll try that out. Turns it into a portable smart Bluetooth speaker! Perfect for staying at somebody else's house.I'm only bummed because the red orb is so pretty.	3	November 25, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	Did they not test this product before mass production?? The sound is just overkill bass even when turn down bass in settings.  Have to repeat yourself several where maybe she will hear you then it's another thing of she hears you correctly. Very very disappointed. They majorly dropped the ball on this. The previous models were way better than this one as far as function and sound. Shame on the designers on this and on the people that approved this model. Buy gen 3 or wait and hope they do waaaaay better on gen 5. Which they should send out free to all the people that wasted their hard earned money on this model.	2	July 15, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Alexa was having a hard time understanding me, and people could barely hear me using the communication functions, even if I was extremely close to the echo. Also, this is subjective, but I think the sound quality for music is not great. It has a lot of bass, and a lot of treble, but they don't mix together well. It seems like whenever a song gets to a part with with mostly higher frequencies, the bass just drops out, it's very distracting. I tried messing with the equalizer, but I never could get it to sound right. Not really a fan of the whole sphere thing either, but that's also subjective. I'm just sticking with echo dots from now on, they may be lacking in bass, but at least they have a cohesive sound, and a microphone that actually works.	2	June 15, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I traded in my first generation Echo and Echo Plus for a fourth generation Echo in black and another one in white.  Like: The new model sounds better than both of my previous Echoes.  I sat them side by side and played a song with plenty of bass at the same volume level.  The new model was louder and produced deeper bass.  I prefer the sphere over the cylinder and the fabric cover over none at all.  The internal temperature sensor is a nice addition as is the Zigbee hub.Dislike: This latest version has A LOT of trouble hearing me even when I'm in the same room it's in and the room is quiet.  In fact, sometimes my third generation Echo Dot hears me despite it being in the adjacent room.  I frequently have to repeat myself or raise my voice before the new model hears me.  This was never the case with the devices I traded in.  I read somewhere the latest Echo has just 4 microphones instead of 7.  What a shame.  I really hope Amazon corrects this issue for the fifth generation Echo.  Finally, I hate that the black unit came with a white power cord.  They should match.	3	January 18, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	So I have 5 different echo devices in my house from several different generations of the device evolution.  This one by FAR under performs on voice recognition!  Looking at the history I can see that it recognizes the wake word but fails to understand the command.  All of the other echos in the house don’t have this problem.Other than that it’s fine for a speaker just like all the others.	2	August 20, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Seriously, this is a lovely speaker. It sounds excellent. If you can get it to hear you, you’ll love the sound.We often have to prompt it, 3-5 times, while the echo dot and plus in the other room have no problem hearing us. Very frustrating…My wife wants me to get rid of it, but I really want to keep the sound quality and thermometer.	2	August 25, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	SHE WILL NOT SHUT UP! She has to  randomly scream and remind me what she is connected to. Why why why! This is when on silent mode. Sound is good and has more features Thant google mini but my mini is easier to use, better voice recognition, AND it keeps its mouth shut unless I want it to talk. Countless complaints about this and Amazon does nothing. Sound and deign are much nicer though. Too bad it doesn’t matter when I want to toss out my window	2	August 4, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I'm at the point where I have some variant of Echo in almost every room in the house, representing several generations of these products. I can say the sound is a big step up from the last generation Echo, but the microphones are a tremendous disappointment. Compared to the prior generation, it doesn't register my voice commands nearly as much and, when it does, it seems to have a higher error rate. I've tried to compensate by moving the device around or just rotating it at different angles, and the problems still exist. I'm seeing some similar comments in the reviews, so I have to conclude that Amazon just ""dropped the ball"" on this one (hilarious, I know.).Would not recommend. Instead spring for an Echo Studio (if you have the spot for a larger speaker) or an Echo Show 8 (if you don't mind the screen), as that model also has really nice sound but does not have the same microphone problems as this model. Or just wait until generation 5.EDIT: Amazon customer service (best in business, no doubt) called and tried to troubleshoot the device a bit. Doing a factory reset seemed to help slightly, but there is just no way this device hears me as well as previous generations or the other Echo iterations that I own."	3	November 22, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I replaced my old Pringles-can Echos with the new ball-style, and while they may look better and resist getting knocked over by my cat, they seem to have gotten worse at basic things like language comprehension. If I listen to the same 3 podcasts weekly, and I ask to hear the latest episode of one of those podcasts, how can Alexa constantly misunderstand and play some obscure podcast I've never heard before? Other times, I ask the Echo to do something basic like telling me the time, the blue light comes on for a second, but Alexa never says or does anything, not even ""Sorry, I didn't understand you."" The old Echos never did that.The real kicker, though, is the execrable ""by the way"" feature, which constantly asks me if I want to use some ability that I'm not interested in. I find myself actually getting mad and swearing at Alexa when she asks me if I want to try some inane, useless skill. If anyone at Amazon is actually listening to what I say to my Echo, then I apologize for my salty language. But if you continue to annoy me rather than assist me, then I'm going to move from swearing at my new Echos to throwing them in the trash and switching to Google's platform."	2	December 23, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I like the way it sounds. I really do. But the problem is, I can't even use it to listen to music at all. The problem traces back to very poor voice recognition.While you're playing music through the device, you may want to ask Alexa to control your home. But it can't hear you use the wake word at all. So I chose to have it connect to my old Creative Bluetooth speaker, which I have been using with Alexa since my old 2nd gen Echo dot from years ago. Sad really.But even with that Bluetooth speaker, the recognition of the wake word is so unstable. Sometimes I'm having a conversation on the phone or have the TV on (quite a bit of yards away at the opposite side of the room actually), it thinks it heard ""Alexa"", when really no one and nothing said it. I have no idea.Meanwhile, when I actually want to trigger it and I'm actually saying ""Alexa"", it's a hit or miss; either it won't react and I'll have to say it two or three more times, or it will actually work. It works about half the time. When it doesn't work, sometimes I have to scream ""Alexa"" louder and louder just to trigger the wake word. Sometimes it has to be so loud that my throat gets sore just from screaming the wake word.And in my experience, these frustrations I'm having are unique to this Echo 4th generation. I've also owned and used the Echo Dot 2nd Generation (which sounds awful on its own but see my comment about Bluetooth speaker above), and the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. Personally, I wish I just stuck with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. At least that one only got mistriggered (is that a word? Lol) whenever there was an Alexa ad on the TV.Overall, if you already own an Alexa device, I highly recommend you stay away from this because it'll feel like a downgrade."	2	January 3, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	It would seem the only way to turn off ads is to cripple the device.  It's a shame, because otherwise this would be handy in my life.  As it is I find myself frustrated with it quite a bit.  It's like having a stranger chime up in my living room every once in a while about things they want to rip me off with.Great for timers, though that is very limited as well.I guess I would call the device 'smart lite'.  It reminds me of back when streaming was locked up by only a few companies and the interfaces really sucked.  At least that got a little better over the years, like skip options, etc. Alexa in it's current state feels crippled, crippled because Amazon can, not because it has to.As a device it's a single speaker so limited in it's application and basically a really expensive paper weight when the internet goes down or the amazon servers go down.	2	April 7, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I love that I can bridge to my blinds but other than that I think it stinks. It fails to hear half my commands and gets them incorrect more often than not if it hears me.

Echo 4th Gen	Pros:- Buen sonido.- Excelente integración con Alexa.Cons:- Hace falta que tenga la mayoría de servicios de música disponible, principalmente YouTube Music.- El servicio de traducción la falta mejoría en comparación a Google.- Cuando se habilita el modo bilingue en inglés y español, hay ciertos lapsos que Alexa se confunde, debería estar preparada para cuando detecte inglés sólo conteste en dicho idioma, al igual en español. En alarmas, recordatorios...- Deben activar el modo Ad Guard para el resto de regiones, mi compra era principalmente para el uso de esa funcionalidad, y lamentablemente no está activo.	3	January 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	the speaker works sometimes it doesnt respond after it sits looking for supporting motion sensors still that are for outside that work with zigbee. support poor imo	3	May 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Great but I bought this to replace a 3rd gen that died. However, 90% of the time. When playing music as part of a group with my existing 3rd gen, constantly fails to start playing or if it does, stops playing after a few songs.It's super frustrating to say the least. Have considered changing my 3rd gen out but seems ridiculous that it would have such trouble syncing a 4th gen with the 3rd gen.	3	February 19, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The 3rd gen was amazing. Mic could hear and understand from basically anywhere in my apartment. The Mic on the 4 is constantly not even hearing me. The sound is still decent and deep, but no where close to where it was with the 3rd gen. I’m honestly ready to get rid of it completely as I get more out of a Bluetooth speaker at this point. It’s upsetting the Echo fell this far.	2	August 20, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	love the sound. Do not like the fact if you don't ask her a question within a certain amount of time,the music stops! When the music starts again,it is the same playlist. you need to mix up the playlists. Classic Rock,Hair Metal,80s rock,etc. always the same playlist. Need to mix it up.	3	April 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I am hearing impaired so I use a Bluetooth link between my Echo and my TV. The speaker is placed near my hearing ear so I don't have to blast the internal TV speaker. But what I don't like - the echo rarely responds to voice queries. I ask a question and it will be answered by my echo show in another room, 40 feet away. Very very annoying.	3	March 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The product turns itself on at 3:30 am not sure why !	3	May 28, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have owned pretty much every generation of echo dot. This time I wanted to upgrade to see if the sound is really better. And it is! This speaker is great for playing music. The mic to wake up and voice recognition is also great.There is one major flaw why I returned the item. If you set a volume loud enough to hear Alexa well it will blow you away when you play music. If you turn it down so the music is not waking up the neighbors it is simply too low to hear Alexa. The echo dot is way better balanced. I wish there was a volume setting for voice and music.	3	December 2, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I replaced a several year old cylinder style Echo with a new 4th gen (the old one died). This version is worse in pretty much every way. Specifically, the voice recognition is way worse. I frequently have to issue a command several times, with the key seeming to be artificially lowering my (male) voice, and making sure I leave a slight pause between ""alexa"" and the command. I was impressed with the previous Echo's recognition and came it rely on it for controlling lights and more. This version is often frustrating to use. I would not buy this again. A friend of mine has this same version and has the same problem.The sound quality is pretty subjective, but this version has more bass, but doesn't actually sound any better. Music is listenable, but still pretty poor--similar to before. I turned down the bass in the EQ to make it more balanced.The volume buttons are also worse than the old rotating control. The lights on the bottom are harder to see than the old ones on top (especially when changing volume and looking directly down). Aesthetically it looks OK, but ""stands out"" more and takes up more space, so the old style was more practical."	3	February 22, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	To start off, as an Echo it functions great like you would expect and others I have had before it.Unfortunately, It is very big and very ugly.  It is like a cloth looking ball.  Who wants that in your living room to see all the time.  The best was the 2nd gen, it is a short cylinder and I have the walnut dark brown version.  It looks good to have in a living room.  The 4th gen ball does not.  It won't even fit where I have my current one.  A very poor design decision.  Took off 2 starts for that.	3	December 6, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Don't get fooled by the ""Premium Sound"" designation and pay the extra $$.It's not worth it. The sound is muddy and dull. No real high frequencies and no real bass. It's all just a midrange blur. If you just looking for Echo functionality, save yourself some cash and get the regular version.And the setup is a  bungling mess. It keeps giving me error messages, while at the same time it does obey commands.I also wish it was weather-proof, but that's just a wish...Anyway, I'm not happy. It may have to go back..."	3	December 30, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded from a 1st generation Echo to 4th generation to use the internal temperature sensor to control fans. The temperature control functionality is unuseful. It seems to require the temperature to cross the setpoint before triggering an action. For example, if the temperature setpoint is 75 degrees and its 76 degrees, the action will not trigger. It only triggers when the temperature drops below 75 degrees and then increases back to 76 degrees. This is useless logic for temperature controllers, but apparently a legacy problem. I rated two stars because this amounts to false advertising. Otherwise I have been using Echos for years and I am satisfied with most capabilities.I also tried integrating a Hubitat controller with Alexa to send a virtual switch. Unfortunately Alexa routine triggers are limited to schedule and temperature sensor. Alexa will not allow the virtual switch as a trigger.12/20/20 Update:Amazon tech support called me after reading this review. They suggested including all devices in the routine which didn't fix the issue. We also tried deleting and adding back the routine. We tried a schedule trigger instead of a temperature trigger which did work. Basically temperature routines don't work. Today I successfully paired an external zigbee temperature sensor. Temperature based routines still don't work.	3	December 15, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I got these a few years ago for surround sound for my tv. They worked ok for a month or so and would randomly disconnect so I stopped using them for that purpose and used them for multi room sound. It was fine for a while and they would disconnect occasionally but now they won't connect at all. I spent 2 hours trying to fix the issue myself before contacting support then nearly 2 more hours with support and still no resolution. They said they would contact me in 5-7 business days so who knows...My other issues with the devices are that they never seem to understand anything I say. I had the old echo dots and had very few issues with them understanding me. One would assume the newer more expensive devices would work better, right? with these I commonly get the response ""I'm sorry, I didn't get that"" or ""something went wrong."" My favorite was when I asked to turn the lights down and Alexa played me the song Mr Grinch. When I ask to adjust the thermostat she will either play some random song or tell me that I'm 2.2 miles from the city I live in. Other voice commands give equally random results.Also, one of my devices started reporting the room temperature in °C instead of °F out of the blue one day. If I asked for the outside temp or the other rooms temp, it would respond in °F, but the room I was in was °C. I spent 2 hours with support resetting the device, adjusting settings and restarting the router before giving up and swapping that device for one in another room.If you want a device that doesn't do what it's advertised to do and does do random stuff when you ask for something, then this is the device for you."	2	January 8, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality not good.  Very, very bass heavy.  Cannot adjust treble to compensate	3	May 24, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I was hoping the sound would have the highs and lows of a premium speaker. Unfortunately, there is plenty of lows with a powerful base sounds but not much on the highs provided by the tweeters.  Also, despite the fact that I have single use music unlimited, it doesn’t recognize consistently provided this unlimited music subscription on the speaker, despite the fact it’s the only speaker in use, I also have a dot and show.l.

Echo 4th Gen	"It seems like years ago the ""announcement"" feature would work as good as it used to. (We use this often in our household to talk to each other.)  We will say announce and it will not hear us sometimes but usually we will say ""Alexa, Announce, The book is on the shelf ready for pickup"" and Alexa will announce ""The book"" or ""The book is"". Also the audio quality is not as good I feel like as even when we do get our full statement across the quality is bad and we cannot hear it.  Maybe the developers are compressing the audio to much???"	3	December 11, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	So I mainly use mine as an alarm clock and for music. The software used to work seamlessly with my iPhone and PC with my third gen alexa. This one is more janky sometimes annoying to get it to play what I want it too. For alarm purposes works perfectly just kinda upset that I upgraded and got something worse. Plus whit power cable is kinda ugly. It looks and feels cheap.	3	February 21, 2022	1

Echo 4th Gen	"The app is clunky. If you have a ""household"" prepare for a nightmare when you want to set up audio by room or everywhere if not everyone lives in the same house despite different accounts.Devices don't connect simultaneously (i.e. turn lights on) and audio splitting is laggy. Connects to my phone, but doesn't always make calls from it when I ask-- its capable, its done it, it just doesn't ALWAYS do it even with an exact command.Can't get it to connect to my Bluetooth stereo, won't connect to my tvs even though it can find them. Can't always control my firesticks and she says they don't exist under voice command but can control from app.Other than that-- the device itself has excellent audio quality-- I'm picking it over my 5.1 stereo half the time. Blueprints are dope for getting her to say whatever I want as long as I can figure out a proper phonetic spelling. Its a cool gadget, just doesn't deliver all as promised.I have a lot of hair ripping moments, and a lot of future is now moments with this device. I see the potential, its just taking a lot more tweaking and tech know-how than I expected."	3	December 13, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	Device quality great, but Alexa not so much with too many unwanted commercials.	3	May 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have this Alexa device in my room and I keep the first version in my restroom. Let me tell you that the quality of sound is good but every time I call for ‘Alexa’ it doesn’t listen. And it can be next to me and it won’t listen to my commands. The 1st generation Mini echo can listen to me and I don’t have to be repeating myself, cost me $15 3 years ago and it still is better quality than this brand new one, it’s disappointing.	3	January 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Don’t pay $99 for this speaker you can find this for $60 at many retailer’s. It is better than the previous version but not by much. The design is nice like a ball 👍 unfortunately two weeks after I got this I picked up the Belkin SOUNDFORM™ elite Alexa speaker so unfortunately this one was retired to the garage lol. My recommendation for the next generation of Alexa would be to have a charging dock or cradle to the next design or at least a USB out. My recommendation🙏	3	January 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	FOR ONE IT DOES'NT DO MUCH OF ANYTHING THAT SAVE TIMES AND IS REALY USEFULL, UNLESS YOU SPEND MORE MONEY BUYING OUTLETS SWITCH FOR EVERY LITTLE THINGS you want it to INTERACTS WITH ITS NOT ALL BAD BUT ITS FAR FROM BEING A GLORYFIED ATIFICAL INTEL BUT NOT REALLY FUNCTIONAL AND USERS FRIENDLY WHERE YOU WOULD THINK OF A COMPLETE SET SMART LIKE SYSTEM WHERE WE END UP SPENDING MORE MONEY FOR GETING LESS. BECAUSE ALONE Alexa is basically an incomplete clock ball IN NEED OF A SERIOUE MAKE OVER	2	July 16, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	1-year update and I have to say that this product is very inconsistent.  I mostly use this for listening to music.  Some days it will play perfect for hours.  Then the next day I can't get it to play a whole song without cutting out.  Unplug, restart, and it does it more.  Then Alexa doesn't respond correctly to audio commands.  I'm just about done with this junk.  It's an audio speaker and it can barely do that on it's best day.  Pair the subwoofer with it and multiply your headaches!!!  Sometimes it works, other times it don't... and then on the rare occasion, the SUBWOOFER will play music when the speaker won't.  VERY annoying!!!	1	October 24, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I had essentially the same problems with the prior generation full sized echo with hub, and decided to return it for a refund.  I've had this unit for more than 6 months, but just now getting tired of it's deficiencies and decided to write a review. First off, the smart hub features seem to work fine. My issues are with voice recognition and audio quality. It's pretty crappy.I have a same generation Echo Dot across the room. Often if I'm standing immediately next to this larger Echo hub and say something to it, it doesn't respond, but the one 20 feet away across the room does. Sometimes I can make 2 back-to-back requests, standing next to the unit with my mouth facing it, and with the same voice volume - one of the requests will be answered by it and the other will be answered from the unit 20 feet away.I do not believe it is simply ""confusion"" between the two units.  Before I had the Dot, I would have experienced the hub unit simply not responding to my voice at all.Audio quality is terrible - I have a house full of Echo's including a 1st generation Echo.  It is very muffled, like if you turned up bass to the max, and treble to the min. It's almost as if it simply doesn't produce ANY high frequencies.  My same generation Echo dot, and 1st generation Echo sound FAR better. My Dot w/clock sounds fine.  but this unit, just like the prior edition hub sound like they are under a pillow.  and yes, I have adjusted bass down and treble up...tiny bit of improvement but it still sucks."	2	April 21, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this specifically to get a certain radio station in our living room as the 1990s receiver no longer works for radio. This was far cheaper than replacing the receiver. It frequently misunderstands my commands. It knows my voice, but does really weird things instead of what I want. It isn't terrible, but it is just okay. I can get my radio station. I have used it for some reminders. I suppose it is learning and I am also.	3	January 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	We bought the echo about 6 months ago.  We were impressed with the sound quality of the echo, the depth of sound is pretty good.However!  The quality of the sound is moot when you can’t get the device to actually play music.  This is the most glitchy device I have ever purchased.  We’ve had issues from the beginning.  I would have to reconnect it to the wifi almost daily, sometimes restarting my router just to get the stupid thing to reconnect, even though every other device in the home was connected.Ok, maybe there was something wrong with the signal of our router, so we purchased google routers and placed them all over our house to broadcast the signal better.  I guess that worked because we haven’t had Alexa tell us she’s not connected to the internet anymore.  But NOW she just won’t play music whenever she doesn’t feel like doing it.  In order to get the echo play music nowadays we have to unplug it for a minute and then plug it back in and that will last for a while. If we have music playing in the background for a couple of hours, you can tell when it needs to be unplugged and plugged back in because it will just decide to stop playing music for no reason.Would have returned it right away and given it one star if the sound quality was garbage.  But my husband is willing to put up with it because while it’s working, after all the screwballing around to get it to work, it sounds great.	2	May 24, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	First off, I’m still a bit upset my first Echo plus ironically went out a couple weeks after the warranty expired. I am not a fan of the bigger footprint and round ball design. I liked the cylindrical design way better as it had a smaller footprint. The ugly white cord is way too short so you’ll probably need an extension cord depending on if and where your going to mount it. As other reviewers say, it does have a problem hearing it’s “wake up” name here and there but not often enough to annoy us yet. The sound is a bit better than my old unit but we don’t use it for music. Overall its ok, if you need a hub it’s probably the cheapest way to go.	3	October 1, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I've had these devices for years, I am now constantly saying ""Alexa, shut up!"" as she blabs on with her ""by the way..."" suggestions. There is no way to shut this off.Automation is constantly adding duplicate devices, integrations with devices like Treatlife do not add the devices and it confuses the names of devices responding with things like ""...there is no device named potato light""I had hoped that this device with smart device support would fix issues, but it did not, and has no display. The do not make an echo with smart device support with a display (except the show echos)"	2	June 24, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Has all of a sudden started making this horrible static noise when I'm listening to music or radio, etc.  Gets so bad I have to turn off!	3	April 29, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I really love the good bass sound from this device. Alexa is great. Added Amazon Music Unlimited so music listening is great. Also love the ability to receive calls from other Echo users or people using their mobile phones, and likewise to call other Echo devices and mobile phones. The major drawback with this product is that the music volumes aren't normalized between songs. The volume can drastically change between songs. This is a major flaw.  It isn't a good music listening experience.	3	January 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have 3 alexas. My 3d generation picks up better in another room that this one does. I bought the better of this stile and very disapointed. They put in a bigger speaker and took away from other part insted of making a kick ass unit. I guess that is big corp. They saved 25cents and lost a customer. Good job I say. Now the thing is not playing right. I got it 9 months ago. Maybe the gen 3s where working to good so they made it to break down. I am going to prob buy a google one and give this one away. If I can get it working. I it sucks because I really like alexa and my gen 3 is a bad ass unit. It might have  been just to good.	3	September 11, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	The hub is supposed to allow light control when internet is out or resetting. It does not, all other devices are connected to the Echo 4th gen hub, the lights are, but if internet  is out all i get is there is no internet and all the fricken lights stay on. IF power goes out ALL lights ocme on an i cant voice control until router connects to internet that main is connected too.I was lied to that it would work with the specific bulbs when the internet is disconnected. Does not work same as the old echo plus.	3	November 23, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	But if you whisper from the toilet in another room she responds.  Totally crazy.  I’m getting to the point where I’m going to throw this one away or maybe use it as an extra speaker for more sound and out my original Alexa back up because she listens when you tell her things.	2	August 17, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	This was a gift. Set up was fairly easy. This could be a very useful tool-unfortunately, it does not integrate with my TCL Smart TV although it is supposed to. In fact, it doesn’t help with any of my electronic or electrical devices, lights, etc because mine are “standard” and not “Alexa-type”. So unless I invest quite a bit of money and alter what’s in place- This Echo is very restrictive in what it can do for me.	3	January 13, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Often feel like l'm talking to a rebellious child, as it doesn't seem to listen well.  Ask it how many songs are in your current play list & it sends you to some weird alt rock Amazon station.	3	April 9, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The older styles were much better as they emitted sound from all directions. You really need to be directly in front of this one to get the best sound quality which is a big letdown and change from prior models.	3	March 28, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	If you are fully ingrained in the Amazon eco system, then maybe you'll enjoy this product, but you'd be better off just buying a higher quality Bluetooth speaker (that's portable) for the same price.It was given to me as a present and has been nothing but a pain. First it wouldn't activate, support said it had been returned and that I needed to purchase it in order to get it to work. After some annoying back and forth followed by me calling it quits and asking to return it, they finally activated it so I wouldn't hurt their bottom line. Added sportify, started playing some music, and was meh about it. They replace quality sound with an obnoxiously plastic sounding big thumping bass that drowns out the mids and highs even when turned all the way down.Went to use the speaker for a second time, and it will no longer connect to my Spotify, but will still play music/audio books through any of Amazon's services(hmmmm.....). Did all of the troubleshooting steps recommended by support, and still no luck.Not worth the money or hassle.	2	January 12, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	The new Alexa is cumbersome to move around. You really can't hold it comfortably in one hand. The sound is somewhat improved , the quality of the sound is often the quality of the location the sound is heard in. I listen in my home or on the deck. So to compare it to the old one is tough. I can notice the bass a little more. The sound quality of the old Alexa was very good. Moving Alexa from point A to point B is a pain. Certainly there was a need to tweak the old Alexa. But to completely reconfigure/redesign the whole thing then require a base attachment for portability is perplexing. I love my Alexa and the music she brings into my life. It's too bad it's gotten more cumbersome for me to enjoy my music.	3	August 27, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought a Google Nest Hub Max at the same time, and noticed the following:Sound quality: The Echo has better sound quality.Voice recognition: Google Nest Hub Max voice recognition is far superior, I often have to shout for the Echo to acknowledge my voice, even at short distances.Usability: Google Nest Hub Max is sooo much easier to use since it doesn't have all the regional restrictions that the Echo has, I can't even download the Alexa app in HK and had to use a VPN. Then even with the app set up, most of the skills don't work on the Echo with no explanation given, including flash briefings (I can only get the weather on the Echo, but can get the full list when using the Alexa app). Tech support was completely unhelpful. And even if I set Spotify as the default music provider, it almost always plays music from Amazon Music instead.I guess users in the US may have a better experience, but due to compatibility issues here in HK I can just about use it for playing music. Conclusion: Just buy the Google Nest to save yourself some grief.	3	December 24, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I recently bought a Muse headband with an app that I connect to my Amazon Echo. When the headband detects I've woken up in the middle of the night, it connects to BT and starts play sleep sounds to get me back to sleep. Unfortunately, every time the Echo connects to BT it announces very loudly ""Connected to iPhone!"" which startles me. I've done research and there have been complaints since 2016 of this but Amazon is not listening to their customers. There is no way to change it. Even if announcements are set to off and brief mode is on.Unfortunately, that meant I have to return and get a Google Nest Audio, which meant if I really want to use the Muse headband I have to switch my smart home to Google. All I can say is if you want some peace with the BT feature on a smart speaker, get the Google Nest Audio. It's much better. It will play a soft connection sound. It's a hassle changing everything but makes a world of difference, and I am now happy overall with a company that pays attention to its customers."	2	December 30, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this to replace my 3rd gen echo dot for improved sound quality.  The sound is better than the dot it replaced so I'm pretty happy with that aspect.  Compared to both the 3rd and 4th gen echo dots I own, the microphone does not seem to work as well.  I never had as much trouble with the 3rd gen that this replaced in exactly the same spot and conditions.It also refuses to change the volume about 50% of the time by voice command.  Every other night I have to change volume by hand or in the app because it just won't. I wouldn't buy this again from the frustration with the failed volume control and poor mic.  Eventually I'll get fed up enough to replace it and it probably won't be with an Amazon product.	3	August 20, 2021	1

Echo 4th Gen	I traded in my 1st generation Echo for the new 4th generation sphere one, thinking that things would have improved over a couple of years. In two key ways, they have not.1. Mics are less effective.The mics are actually worse at picking up my voice. I find myself repeating the wake word more often, and at a louder volume, just to get the same result. The old cylinder was pretty omni-directional; they new one less so.2. The sound is overly bassy.Yes, you can adjust the bass through the app to tone it down, but you shouldn't have to. I don't have the old and new side by side, so it's hard to judge which sounds better overall, but at least on the default bass setting the new one seems less accurate.What do I like better on the new one? It's shorter, so it doesn't stick out as much on the kitchen island where it lives. You can judge for yourself whether the new esthetic is better, but the design change was not the reason I purchased the new one - I thought the mics and sound would be better, and I'm disappointed.	3	December 22, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	"This item was got through Amazon and was ""pre set"" for me.  It did not work properly with no microphone. After a walk through where I had to re set it myself, it worked, but he microphone became less and less responsive over the months that I continued to make payments. As soon as it was paid off, the microphone stopped responding to most commands.  Music playing in groups gets disrupted and stopped due to this device, while when unplugged, I get good music.  Customer service told me online that it will simply be replaced, since it is within warantee, and to follow instructions to send the bad one back.  After that communication, I was told differently online that it is a REPAIR request, that they are not honoring the warantee replacement, and that I have to send the item to Amaaon via UPS, have their technicans take it apart and analize it, then send it back to me.  So one customer service tells me that the new one is ordered and will be here in 3-5 business days, another tells me that I will get nothing until they get the broken one and fix it then send it back, and now I am on perpetual hold because the phone operators are too busy goofing off to actually provide any kind of completent assistance."	1	June 17, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	"Out of the box... WAY TOO MUCH BASS! Echo's speaker equalizer settings (LOW-bass/MID-range/HIGH-tweeter) are TOO important to bury inside Alexa app! They should have their own buttons on top of the orb next to volume settings. For now, put Equalizer button prominently next to volume button in per device controls in app! On next update, provide some presets like Hip-Hop, Country, Pop, Rock, Talk, etc. ""Alexa... Preset ROCK... Play The Eagles on Pandora!"" ... ""Alexa... Preset RAP...

Echo 4th Gen	First impression: why on earth would Amazon pair a white power cord to a black speaker?? At the very least, give customers a cord color option; for me, my intended placement was a black granite counter btwn my kitchen and family rm, so no opportunity to conceal. Why should I have to pay $20-30 extra for a color-matched cord? Never has been an issue for past Echo devices, of which I have MANY... 14 I thinkSecond: I've grown fond of the cylinder shape, not a fan of this spherical shape; it might make sense if the sound was not front-firing, but sadly is. I could grow accustomed to that if not for the white cord, which Hubby said he could paint, but why should that even need to be a consideration? Besides, my plan was to add a 2nd one as well and, if they failed, alterations would negate the ability to returnLastly: I have 2 charcoal Gen 3 Echos on that same counter; they have black cords, sound really grea! and look great. The last straw was that the sound quality from this 4th Gen was underwhelming; if it was supposed to be a big improvement over the Gen 3s, they definitely missed the mark and it's surely not worth the sacrifices I'd make in appearance. ReturningP.S. To the engineers, please take note! It doesn't matter how much you improve the sound quality - if you also degrade the appearance exponentially it's NOT going in my house. I doubt I'm alone on this...	2	June 22, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I was excited about this new Echo.  I was especially excited to be able to trade in my old model to this new one.  The sound is great BUT it doesn't recognize my husbands voice AT ALL.  Also we had a routine and I tried to recreate it for the new one.  It won't recognize the routine.  It took me 2 hours to figure out how to set up a routine.  I tried to get support but it continues to get me to on-line stuff and you cannot talk to anyone.  I wish I had never upgraded.  If I could go back I would.UPDATE:An amazon representative called me and the young man was so very nice.  He helped me resolve the issues above quite easily. Sent a long detailed email on what to do.  I now will say that I would purchase again.  I upgraded the review to a 3 and switched between a 3 & a 4 but settled on a 3 because it was a struggle to get to this point.  I would Recommend this dot.Thanks Sarah	3	January 4, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"This is a stylish unit, but that may be the cause for concern.  I have all the generations of Echo units in operation currently, and this one really comes up short on voice recognition.  The older units can be triggered from 20+ feet away, which is really helpful when turning on lights, for example, as you are entering a dark room.  This unit has trouble beyond 5 feet.Sound quality is on par with the 3rd gen unit.The light ring at the bottom is also not optimal, as it is not as easily noticed from a distance.I truly believe this generation was an effort in value engineering.  It just feels ""Cheaper"" that it's older sibling.  Part of this is the removal of the volume adjustment via the top ring.One more note, the control buttons are right on the fabric, so grimy hands will stain the speaker mesh over time.  This unit also needs to be dusted with a vacuum or canned air, as it cannot be wiped off on top due to the fabric cover."	3	February 4, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I wanted a major competitor's version of this, but because that one didn't even offer Bluetooth and was about 230 more...so, after hearing an Echo (I think the one I heard was from earlier 2019..it was tall), I decided to buy one.  Firstly, though the sound is mediocre for its price point, it does not sound as great as the early 2019 one I heard.  This one sounds ok in a large bedroom, but fails miserably in a smaller bedroom (my craft room). There, it, literally, sounds like what it is...a small basic Bluetooth speaker.  Very treble!  I turned it off an connected my iPad back up to the Bluetooth stereo system instead.  I am going to keep it as it does integrate SiriusXM amongst others, but it will remain in the larger bedroom.  Setup was not terribly fun.  My daughter has a dot (those sound worse than this one) and anytime I told Alexa to do something, it went on HER echo...even though we were on opposite ends of the house.  I think this is made more to be used as a system throughout the house versus a more individual toy. I think I got it sorted out now, but there are still issues. It doesn't always respond and it does go out.  I've read it's a WiFi issue, but nothing else goes out when the echo goes out.  My daughter loves hers (she's 16), but she's addicted to music subscription services.  Would I buy it if I had to again?  Probably not.  I'm not too much into this smarthome  technology.  I'm more into sound quality...if the competitor's had Bluetooth, it'd be sitting here instead of the Echo.	2	December 24, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	I bought the first echo device and loved it. I have purchase many echo dots since then (8-10). Our family loves them all. This fourth generation echo is subpar at best in my opinion.I have owned it for about a year now and the device does not respond as well as the dots. I wish I would have returned it when purchased because it does not function well as an Alexa Assistant.We are constantly having to repeat ourselves when sitting right beside the device. It often does not complete the requested task when it does hear us. It’s ability to listen and respond is far inferior to all the other echo dots we have (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation).The sound quality is good but that is not a significant selling point for me personally. I wanted Alexa to work well on a device with sound better/louder than the dot. That isn’t a high bar for sound quality since the dots are small. So, it meets my needs for sound quality but my bar is set low in that area.It does not meet my needs as an Alexa assistant in our main room of the house.	2	November 25, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this mainly to improve sound quality from the small tv in my kitchen after being disappointed with the Echo Studio. The dot was slightly better at connecting to my firestick 4k than the echo studio was, but not much. I frequently had to turn everything off then back on or fiddle with settings.I honestly didn’t notice a big difference between the echo premium and a standard echo. I’m sure there’s a more significant difference in sound quality at loud volumes but it was not worth it for me, as someone who takes it seriously when someone claims the audio output as a selling point.I eventually returned it for a standard echo 4th Gen and a $60 refurbished Sony sound bar. The sound quality is sooooo much better and the price difference was negligible after sales.	3	August 13, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"""Alexa, play Spotify"" - yeah right. This skill seldom works and you have to constantly re-authorize your Spotify account and use the Alexa app to start it up. This is why the Spotify skill has 12,000+ reviews and only 2 stars. Why is this? Platform inoperability, which is as old as the tech industry itself. What it means is that developers have a positive disincentive to make their product work with a competitor's product. Is it hard left to make Spotify work on this device? Probably not. Do Amazon or Spotify want it to work? Definitely not, and that is how we end up here."	3	October 26, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	trato de hacer sonar todos mis dispositivos al tiempo, pero no se porque el bendito aparato se conecta a otra red que tengo configurada, pero lo saco de ahí, lo coloco en la red que quiero y cuando trato de hacer sonar todos los aparatos al tiempo cambia de red, creo que hay una oportunidad para mejora, que independiente de las redes, si mi aparato esta configurado con mi ID de Amazon, sin importar la red, deberían todos sonar al tiempo, ya otra cosa es que Spotify por ejemplo, lo permita, pero eso también tiene solución.Con respecto al sonido, cuando se combinan este con el echo dos de 4th generación, suenan espectacular, el primero tiene un bajo aceptable que el otro no tiene, pero el segundo tiene un brillo que el otro no tiene, lo que me parece raro porque se supone que tiene dos twiters (o como se escriba).Le diera 5 estrellas si no fuera por ese detalle que escoge entre dos redes disponibles, me imagino que buscando ofrecer la mejor calidad de comunicación, sin embargo, me niega la posibilidad multiroom, a mejorar eso Amazon Team.	3	December 27, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	I ordered a black echo to place in my kitchen. The device works well, and the set up is easy. However, it comes standard with a white cord now, which is not disclosed when you place the order.  It looks ridiculous, and it appears like a mismatched cord with another device.  If you order red - you get a white cord.  Grey - white cord.  Blue - white cord...  After working with Amazon customer support, I was told to order a new black cord and pay for it, and they would let me then request a refund on the matching cord.  What??!!  Anyway, the device is fine, and I would give a five-star review to the device otherwise.	3	September 8, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I am a huge fan of Amazon's products and I love how I was able to integrate Alexa with my firestick, smart switches and lamps, or just use it as a Bluetooth device.But -1. Auto Bluetooth Connect - Alexa announces whenever a bluetooth device is connected. You dont have any control over that to disable Auto-Connect. You might be listening to music on your phone and then you powerup your laptop and it will connect to your laptop and switches back and forth sometimes. The only solution Amazon has given, is to Forget your device from bluetooth settings EACH time you are done using it.2. Announcements! - I tried disabling this but Alexa wont stop announcing every time I connect a device to Alexa and its so loud. Sometimes Alexa randomly connects to my phone in the *middle of the night* (because there may be a notification on my phone).It goes like ""NOW CONNECTED TO REDMI NOTE PRO""! at 3 AM!!!"	2	February 1, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I have 1st and 2nd Gen Echos all over my house.  This is my first 4th gen and I am disappointed.  The sound is much better than my 2nd gen echos but it does not wake up very easily at all.  I can be standing 6 feet in front of it and say Alexa and my 2nd gen 20 feet away in my family room will wake up and still nothing from the 4th gen.  Tech support had me do a hard reset with no improvement and offered to send me a refurb for my brand new echo.  No thanks, I will just return itUpdate:  After my previous review, a rep from Amazon contacted me and was very helpful.  He was able to push an update through that fixed my echo and made it much more responsive.2nd Update:  After using the updated echo for a few days it was not more responsive.

Echo 4th Gen	The Echo device has good sound quality and mostly good voice recognition.  It does not play well with streaming Sirius XM though that is one of its capabilities.

Echo 4th Gen	"I've been a fan of the Echo since its inception.  In fact I've had each of the 4 generations (including this one).  I wish I had stayed with the 3rd Gen.  Alexa seems to be getting old, her hearing isn't what it used to be.  I find I have to repeat ""Alexa"" on several occasions for her to respond, as well as repeating requests.  I listen to Amazon Music, and it sounds a little muffled at times.  Not sure if I just have a poor unit or if these points need to be addressed in the next generation."	3	October 22, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"We have two hubs and a dot. The one that *I* actually bought is the only one that doesn't work right. Or - sometimes it does. It's just that sometimes it doesn't. It hears ""Alexa"" but frequently ignores whatever I say after that - as if I'd said nothing at all. It *should* tell you it doesn't understand what you said, but it just acts like it heard nothing. The other two echos are fine, though. Just bad luck"	3	December 18, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is rather good. The bass is heavy, which is good for some music, but not videos. I do feel that I have to yell the command name for it to hear me. This is odd as my first gen echo dot will hear me whisper it's name. I have tested them in the same spot and this device does not recognize as well as previous models. It does not tether to older alexas ( not a minus just extra information). Another thing I have noticed, is that when bluetooth paired with a fire stick; apps like hulu and Netflix seem to crash.This was bought for me as a gift and the pictures are somewhat misleading as they do not show a cord in many of them. This lead to the belief that it had an internal battery that allowed it to be moved between rooms. (Which would have been a great selling point). This device does not have an internal battery. In fact the charge cable it comes with is short, so keep that in mind when thinking about where you wish to place it. I have a first gen alexa and the cable that came with it is longer.A note for Amazon, when this device was first advertised, it showd a globe pattern. When I saw that, I wanted this device. I was disappointed that there was no actual globe/map print available. I feel that whoever designed that add had a great idea that was never produced into reality. To add on, it would have been nice to have the clock face added to this as well.	2	January 3, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Excellent sound quality. While the volume is easily adjustable, there is no need to turn the volume to max in order to hear music or an audio book.However, there is a hearing problem. I have to repeat myself several times and end up shouting at the Echo when I want to be heard.	3	February 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have to reboot this thing every other day - you say something it lights up but no response. 😞	3	April 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have had Echos since the original beta group back in 2014. I still have and use my Gen 1 every day. I currently have 9 of them including Echo Autos, 4 dots, and an Echo Flex. I purchased this 4th gen to replace the 1st gen that I use as the main Echo in my living room. The 1st gen is still working great, but it's not compatible with some of the new Alexa features.We got it last year on black Friday. It would respond to commands OK for a few hours. After that, it would stop responding entirely. You could manually wake it with the button, but it would not hear you at all. A power reset would fix it, for a few hours or a day and then it would happen all over again. After dealing with Amazon, they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same issue. Even when it did work, you had to speak very loud and close. The Echo dots on the other side of the house would respond instead of this one 3 feet away.The Echo was placed in the same location as the one it replaced, on the same network.After going through 2 units, we figured there was some sort of known issue. We returned the second unit and went back to our 1st gen. A year later (hoping that the issues have been worked out), we purchased another unit. Guess what? New unit has the same exact issue.Search Google for Echo 4th gen microphone issues and you will see this happens to a lot of people. Even when they do worth, they don't work nearly as good as previous generations. Which is a shame.For now, this one is going back again and we will continue to use our 1st gen until Amazon can get it together.	1	December 1, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	This was my fifth Alexa Echo products that I've purchased. I don't know what it is about the new design, but now it seems to never hear me say the wake up word. I feel like I have to shout Alexa just to get her to light up, so I know she's listening. I'm also super frustrated that podcast can't be fast-forwarded to specific time within the podcast. I use this feature all the time when Alexa plays an audible book, so why can't it be used for podcast as well? I also feel like this most recent iteration of the echo doesn't understand what I'm asking, even though I can  use a similar phrase for my studio Echo and I'll be understood. I tried to buy an adapter to put it on the wall cuz I hate how much space it takes on surfaces, and of course I ended up with a dot wall adapter for the echo instead of this size. I just wish they would call it a different name or a different induration or something to make it identifiable without me having to feel like an expert at the dimensions of each of the objects. I found it really irritating that the cord for the power had been shortened almost a foot, and I couldn't put this new echo in the same location as my old Echo because they switch the power integration port to an AUX port instead of whatever it was before. I still love my studio Echo, but overall I'm super disappointed in this product.	2	April 13, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	"All of the 4th Gen Echos are Amazon's greatest failure. The 3rd Gens are great, they hear you every time. they stay connected to the internet, they do what they're made to do every singe time.--The 4th Gens do the exact opposite, from day one all of the 4th Gen ones I have purchased have done nothing but fail to do what they are made to do. They have better speakers, and this big one has added a temperature sensor, which is truly a game changer for routines, allowing Alexa to monitor the temperature of a room and adjust accordingly on her own. Howver she NEVER hears me say her name the first time, 80% of the time once she does, she will not hear the command I give her. How is an Echo supposed to work if it cannot understand its user. That is literally the ONLY thing these things need to do--well that and stay connected to the internet. there is a 50/50 shot that when I say her name, she gives me the ""the intertnet isnt accessible"" line. When it Very much is. every other device I have connects and stays connected just fine. It is only the 4th Gen echos that have so much trouble staying connected.  The temperature sensor is the only real thing worth even trying to buy one of these, but its hugely unreliable at best, and sadly no other temperature sensor can initiate a routine based on the rooms degree yet. -----Do not waste your money on the 4th gen, buy a 3rd gen or wait for the 5thand Amazon, do NOT call me this time. The last time I left a negative review on an echo device (the 4th gen dot) you called me. --I appreciate the gesture, amazing customer support, one of the reasons I love amazon. but this is not a user error, I do IT for a living, this is not failure to set up properly, this is device malfunction."	1	August 18, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I enjoy using echo devices but the echo fourth generation device has much difficulty calibrating the temperature sensor. I recently purchased two fourth generation devices and one finally calibrated the temperature sensor after MANY register/deregister exercises. After 48 hours the other device remains stuck trying to calibrate. My second generation echo devices have no trouble calibrating the temperature sensor. I like my toys to work - I am disappointed with this new toy.	3	December 26, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	This one is worse than generation 2.. to much crap to type.  Take a gamble if you'd like.	3	April 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I’ve been an Alexa user for years and have loved it. I loved the features and the ease it brought to my life. The sound quality of this gen is great; the aesthetics are lovely. I never had a problem with Alexa and Alexa devices—until I upgraded to this gen. If you’re considering it, stop. Don’t do it. I have had nothing but trouble. And I’m not alone. Google it. The problem is pervasive and persistent.I plugged it in initially around Dec 1 and have regretted it since. My device randomly plays audacy at an absurd volume and won’t always shut off—sometimes I have to unplug it to get it to stop. I have tried resetting it, reinstalling the app, factory restores, removing all devices from my account, removing all skills/apps from the device, etc. I’ve watched videos, read help pages, and asked friends in IT to help. Nothing—NOTHING—resolves the issue. I have taken my Alexa down to no skills or apps. Basically it’s now an automated list maker and it STILL randomly plays Audacy (and by “plays” I mean “screams”). It only plays Audacy; nothing else…although it recently started to randomly beep at me. My privacy settings are as locked down as they can be and still—still—the problem remains.Don’t. Do. It. Go to a different system and let Amazon work through its issues in someone else’s home. I’ve had this gen for about 3 months and it’s spent about 1/3 of that time unplugged because the anxiety these random musical attacks trigger makes the whole system not worth it.I miss my Alexa.	1	February 22, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"The only reason that I gave 2 stars is because the sound quality is great. That's where the fun stops.This device is so glitchy that I want to throw it out the window most days. For example, my morning alarm just went off; I'm laying 3 feet from 4th Gen Echo Dot; I ask it to stop the the alarm; from the living room, 30 feet away, I hear ""Morning Alarm stopped on bedroom"". Whyyyyyyy?When I ask Alexa to play music while I'm in the living room, she will respond from the proper device ""what would you like to listen to?"", but then she will start playing the music on the Echo Dot in my bedroom. When I tell her she is playing on the wrong device she'll respond ""I'm sorry, I don't recognize a device by that name"". When I ask her to stop playing the music it she won't, because she's does not recognize I'm talking about the bedroom unit. When I ask her to stop playing music in the Bedroom, she doesn't understand. When I ask her to play music, again, she says ""Amazon Music is currently streaming on another device"". Ugh. How far do think I can throw this thing?Hey Bezos, when you get back from douching around in outer space can you please hire someone to update your Echo Integration System. Thx."	2	August 23, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I think the sound base is amazing.It only needs the time displayed on the actual echo	3	April 27, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have everything from the very first generation (still have my original, I got it during the trial release) through to this one.  The sound quality improved with the second and third generation, but I feel that this round one it went down.  It's harder to hear the responses, even with the volume up, and if not for the fact I have my music play through multiple devices, I would say the music sort of sucks as well.  I would opt for the earlier releases.  I don't need the hub, I have my own good setup at home, so that's not a reason to get it for most people either.	3	September 22, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I don't like the new shape, it takes up more space on my small nightstand. I would've added a pic but Amazon wanted complete access to my camera and pics rather then me selecting one pic to add. The 3rd gen was better, 360 sound and light ring on top. The 4th gen bowling ball isn't 360, you have to put it's back towards a wall. Light ring is now on bottom of ball and is almost impossible to see the yellow ring of light during the daylight when you need it to receive weather alerts from the National Weather Service. The sound might be slightly better if you're standing in front of it but I'd rather have another 3rd gen and not this bowling ball. Don't fix what's not broken! I won't be buying anymore until they return to the cylinder 360 shape with the light ring on top.	3	July 8, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality on these new fourth generation Echo speakers is horrible compared with the previous generation Echo speakers—all of them. What happened?I am so disappointed. I worked with Amazon tech-support, and even they said there must be something wrong, so they processed a return and shipped me a new set and they are equally horrible. I have read independent reviews on third-party websites, and watched them on YouTube, where reviewerss are saying Generation 4 is a total fail. I sure hope the fifth generation will go back to the sound quality of previous generations.I have had many speakers from every generation going back to the first generation (which ironically, was one of the best sounding speakers they made).Also, when you pair these fourth generation Echo speakers with a Fire TV or Fire TV stick, they are somewhat acceptable on the trailers and previews, since the volume of those, same with commercials, is so artificially boosted, (though the speakers are still disappointingly soft and poor quality), but the minute you start the actual show or movie, the sound instantly becomes so quiet that I would equate it to about a volume level 4 on previous generations.I think these were rushed to market because the engineers thought the new round shape was so cool. What was wrong with the previous shape? In a failed effort to “fix” the ain’t-broke design, they completely broke the function.	2	June 5, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I recently traded in all my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen devices to ""upgrade"" to the 4th gen devices.  If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well.  We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor.  Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding.  The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.2) The sound is awful.  The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base.  The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny.  If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it.  Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services.  If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request.  100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times.  Overall, the Echo has gone from a fun device that was worth the potential privacy concerns to an annoying banner ad that you can't click to close.  The current user experience makes me just want to throw these things in the trash and I own 4 of them."	1	February 4, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	My echo, seem to have trouble staying connected and following through with task from the beginning. I contacted Amazon about this I was told there was nothing wrong with it and it just needed to be updated. After the update it continued to glitch out, over a year of fighting the echo. It finally stopped responding, I contacted Amazon. They troubleshooted the device multiple times, they couldn’t fix it. I was told its out of warranty and if I would have contacted them before hand with my problems that they could of helped but all they can do it give me a 15% discount on a new echo. I explained I did contact them before was told my device was fine and pointed this out. I was told sorry but I could buy a new one. Then the new one I looked at couldn’t ship to my address for whatever reason, but I told I could upgrade my device and pay double for the new echo with the 15% discount. Then after my purchase that Amazon will credit my account 10% of my new purchase. I feel like I got a faulty item from the beginning and was given the run around about the item and convinced the echo was fine. So I just assumed it was my internet being slow, which made since until I got a echo show for Christmas and it works perfectly without any problems. So now I have a echo show and a echo dot that’s just sitting on my shelf not responding at all.	1	March 6, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I'm not one of those reviewers who has a bit of Alexa devices in their home as well as a bit of Google Assistant. It just so happened my first free device was an Echo Dot (3rd gen) and the rest is history. Throughout my home I now own:Echo (4th generation)2 Echo Dots (both 3rd gen)Echo Show 8Echo Show 53 Echo FlexFire 8 HD PlusEcho Input (I wish I knew just how phenomenal of a deal these were when I purchased this one, id have 9 of these in my house and 1 device with visual output).Always having the appropriate expectations (ie never expected ie Echo flex to sound like a bose speaker) i have never once been even slightly disappointed with any of the products listed above....until this Echo (4th generation). I prefer the round design and I like to have the latest and greatest, that's all it is, sad but true. I never expected any of these products to actually regress though as their technology allegedly has improved continously. Id say after owning for a month or so im sitting at about a 70% hit rate when it comes to this advice recognizing it's name and and switching into a phase waiting for a command. Not sure what it is either, I've walked right up to and practically yelled ""ALEXA"" (and while I was frustrated I was sure to very clear spoken words) and yet it still didn't respond.I'm really hoping this is a software fix they can push out or I wouldn't hesitate to take this down to 1 star."	2	December 12, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	I love Alexa and own multiple Good evening.  ration of them starting from beta version. I highly recommend Alexa to everyone. However I am giving this 4the generation unit 3 stars as there is no significant difference between this and older version.  This newer unit works fine. I bought this newer 4th generation version thinking it must be better than the older version. I was disappointed as I don’t see a much of a difference at all. Sound quality is pretty much same as previous version.  Buttons and volume control ring is better in previous version. The older unit’s volume ring allows you to lower volume quickly with one smooth motion. In newer units you need to press small volume button multiple times to lower volume. This isn’t a show stopper as you can just voice control Alexa to lower volume. All this highlights is that controls were better thought thru in older unit.Bottom line I highly recommend Alexa to any 1st time user. However save yourself some money and buy older version as it works equally same as this newer version	3	November 19, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	I LOVED the 3rd gen Dot, which was my first foray into Alexa. So when the 4th gen Echo came out, I was hoping for better audio to play music in my living room space. With the Dot, I could quietly ask Alexa something, and she would pick up on it from 10-15 feet away. With this Echo, I have to repeat, and yell a bit for it pick up anything. THEN, the little ring will light up, and the Dot will answer from the other room -_-. I'm standing 5 ft away from the Echo, and about 30 feet away from the Dot. As far as the sound quality for music- it's a bit disappointing. It does seem to sound a touch better than the Dot's but not enough to justify the added cost and space that it takes up. If I had experienced this first, I think I would just try to hook up a better speaker to the Dot. I'm really glad that I gifted my friends the previous gen Dots (new ones weren't released yet), and not the new ones.	3	January 2, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I used to love these devices, but in the last year she's always adding at the end of every command i give her ""by the way ..."". I don't want to here her suggestions or tips or anything. I just want her to do what I asked her to do. I have followed every suggestion I can find on the internet and nothing works. Just tonight she was telling me she can get me ready for the rings of power. Amazon should not be advertising their things in my home like that. They should leave it on their Fire TV and website. I don't need to hear about it when I want to turn my lights off or set a timer. Never buying another amazon smart home device."	1	October 3, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	As a stand alone speaker/Alexa assistant it works as advertised.  Impressed with the sound.  However, very disappointed in the difficulty to set-up additional Echo Dots throughout the house.  Have yet to figure out a good solution to allow our kids to each have an Echo Dot that is linked to their own Spotify account and still be able to use the intercom functionality.  Can't link an Echo Dot to a Kids or Teen Amazon account but only two adult accounts are allowed so two Echos/Dots no issue but more then that is a real pain.  Seems to make the intercom feature useless unless you want to all be linked to the same Spotify account and only be able to listen to music on one Echo at a time.  Not well thought out and very frustrating.	3	July 20, 2021	1

Echo 4th Gen	I really do like this, it is great for music. Unbelievable sound quality from such a small device. My only issue is that after paying $99 for it prior to Christmas , I see it all over in stores for as little as $30 and that pisses me off. I can understand a drop in price some but $70 is a sting.	3	January 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I am pretty new to Alexa - I only have a Dot with a display. Thought I’d but a bigger one to have better sound… Who would’ve thought that the bigger model doesn’t have a display to even show me the clock??

Echo 4th Gen	I had one of the original 'tower' type Alexa echo's.  The sound was good, the light ring was on the top and because it was tower shape... didn't take up too much space. This new one is, in my opinion, too big, too ugly and hard to see the light ring. And if you want the battery ability, you must buy an additional base which makes it even larger and more ugly.ALSO, apparently it doesn't seem to matter what color you buy, your power cord will be white. I bought a black echo and a white electric cord was enclosed.I am not a happy amazon camper.	3	September 18, 2021	1

Echo 4th Gen	If you connect a device to the Echo for bluetooth it YELLS at you when you open anything that uses audio and it has heard anything for 10 minutes.  It is LOUD and there is NO WAY to turn it off.  This has been the same for years and they refuse to fix it.  So if you want to use this for bluetooth, you'll be wasting your money.

Echo 4th Gen	Not sure why this is called “Premium Sound” While I don’t expect it to be as as good as Bose, I expected it to better for the price. The voice recognition is spotty, and doesn’t work as good as my old Gen 1. Thinking I may return…	3	January 31, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Cuando digo que tiene excelente sonido es por mucho mejor que los demas echo que tengo ya voy el 4to, ahora bien el micrófono no te escucha muy bien, hay que gritarle un poco mas para que funciones pero no para morirse, lo que si ha estado ocurriendo es que le cuesta aun integrarse con las demás Echo, segunda y tercera generación, pero tambien creo que hay que actualizarlas también	3	December 11, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I bought this thinking the sound would be better than on the smaller Echos that I have. It's fine, but not superior to the smaller version. I kept it since it was on sale when purchased. It would be nice if this included the digital clock.	3	January 30, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Short answer: it is a functional smart speaker, but the sound is terrible.Long answer: it has more sound and bass than the echo dot, but the bass cracks and the treble is muddy. You might be better off with a dot than the sound from this speaker. If you are buying this instead of the dot going for better sound, don't! You are better off purchasing a JBL flip 4 and hooking up a dot to it.	3	November 21, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have had mine for about a year now.  I call customer service at least every 3rd month.  When you ask when someone was born who is famous, be sure you have the name exact and pronounce it correctly.  Otherwise you get someone else.  When you ask about an actor to find out how old they are you don't always get the right person.  You must know exactly what their full name is to hopefully get the right person. Setting routines up most of the time you need customer service to walk you through.  What seem logical is not. I have decided to give it one more year and if they do not improve getting information from it, I will give it to Goodwill and let someone else have the heard ache.  NOT a real stable device to live with. If you are a very young person and like a lot of silly things then this is the device for you. I usually ask this device first for info and then I have to go to another program on my phone to find the right answer. Think about this before you buy!!!	2	October 28, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	"I'm comparing against a Gen 1 Echo and 2 Gen 1 Dots which I've had since they first hit the market. My Gen 4 device was defective: both hard of hearing (my Gen 1 Dot 30' away in another room would hear me and with this device I had to yell to get it to activate) and the speaking voice sounded muffled compared to my other devices. Other dislikes: I ordered a black Echo but it came with a white cable. It's a minor point but I think a black cable would be more appropriate. Worse however was that the cable is ridiculously short (compared to all my Gen 1 devices) which limits placement without the need for an extension cord. Overall, fairly disappointed and returned. HOWEVER, aside from the cord color and length which would have still resulted in my returning the device, I'm hoping that my ""operationally defective device"" was an anomaly and I just got a bad one. Overall, my wife and I enjoy the conveniences Alexa adds to our smart home and this poor review shouldn't deter you from trying out Alexa if you never have. The 4th Gen Echo did not work for me, so I instead purchased a 3rd Gen Dot; it is my 4th Alexa device."	1	June 4, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	The other day my TV had no sound, I went into the room where my new Alexa was and it was the voice of the TV.  I told Alexa to go off and she didn't listen.  I then unplugged it.  I am afraid to plug it in again.	3	January 14, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I purchased this device on the release date and it has been giving me issues ever since. The main problem is the response time when I say the wake work and it not listening after I start to ask a question. I know this may not be the same experience with many people but compared to the echo studio this seems way slower. I have tried different trouble shooting tips to no avail. I am going to reach out to amazon support to see if there is a solution but I just believe my device my be defective.The sound quality for this device is great and an improvement over the previous generations of the echo and I actually like the design. Besides the lag in responding I would be very happy with the device but it really get annoying when you ask it something it takes seconds to acknowledge you and then when you ask a question it just shuts off. If not for that this would be five stars all across.	3	February 6, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	The Apple Music integration doesn’t allow you to access your Apple Music library or any stations you normally listen to.

Echo 4th Gen	I own many Echo's and I am a fan of the products. With that said, I purchased the Echo 4th Gen (The Ball) to replace my Echo 1st Gen (The Cylinder) as an upgrade.

Echo 4th Gen	"The sound for music is better.  The design is different, still deciding if I like it better or just different.  The front facing speakers as opposed to cylindrical doesn't seem to pick up my voice.  Always yelling ""ALEXA""!  Many times have to say Alexa 2, 3 or 4 times before she picks it up.  If not directly in front of the speaker the voice recognition is poor.  If music is playing or the TV is on, you have to speak loud and clear or she doesn't hear.  It is this speaker, because I have two others on the main level of the house and sometimes one of them will pick up my voice from 20 feet away in a different room and the new 4th generation in the same room with me just sits there.  Not sure if it's worth the frustration or constantly repeating commands to get the better sound quality.  Debating about just returning and waiting for a 5th generation with a better quality microphone."	3	December 25, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	Won't even see bluetooth amplifiers or bluetooth devices outside of their Alexa Preset Profiles which aren't the same as the standard bluetooth.  I have a Samsung 5.1 surround system with a Samsung Bluetooth to Coax adapter that works with everything android, iphone, Windows computers even FireTVs but not the Echo's.  Same thing goes for my Fosi Amplifier w Bluetooth that I purchased on Amazon. Everything works with it except the Echos's. This renders my Echo's and my Amazon Music Account USELESS!  Either fix your bluetooth problem or give us all back our money and then you can cancel my amazon music account! A month is long enough to fix the bluetooth problem! It feels like there is no intention of fixing it now!	2	April 6, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"Had for a few months now. Sound quality isn't much different than the original echo we had, and at least the original one worked every time until it broke. This one doesn't respond half the time, and when it does respond sometimes it says it doesn't know what you're talking about, and other times it just makes that annoying ""bong"" sound and does nothing. This is during something as simple as turning on lights or asking it to shuffle songs. Wouldn't buy again and starting to look at other smart speakers."	2	June 11, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I needed a hub to connect a Philips motion sensor using the “Zigbee” standard to a smart bulb. Amazon says this has a “built-in Zigbee smart home hub” and allows you to “Easily set up compatible Zigbee devices,” but it does not connect to Philips Zigbee motion sensors. A separate Philips bridge is required for those. This misled into buying the Echo when I did not need it.	3	December 9, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I’ve had the old Alexa for years continually having problems with it doesn’t recognize what you’re saying doesn’t answer doesn’t hear you doesn’t really work very good And the new or Alexa exactly the same thing on the market this product you should do a better job take some lessons from Apple	3	January 6, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"First off, it's ugly. Really a big let down. Amazon's first alexa was the best design. They should fire whoever is in charge of the design of this device. I really appreciate the volume ring so much more than the + - buttons for volume.Next, is that that it works okay. Sound is fairly decent but the connect between the device and the Amazon ""cloud"" is really buggy. Sometimes, it'll play all day. Other days it will stop after about 20 minutes. It doesn't seem to understand what I say sometimes as well. It will either not do anything or do something entirely different. And if you say anything to it, it refers you to the support section of the app.The idea is great but it's not done well. They need to rehire some folks and return to the cylinder shape. Hopefully with the volume ring instead of buttons. My original alexa is still functioning flawlessly. Wish they still had that quality.Good luck."	3	February 13, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I already had a few 3rd generation Echo Dots, and 1) Wanted to add a hub, 2) Was intrigued by the press reviews of the 4th generation devices. So when the “limited edition” Echo Red was issued I eventually decided to give it a try as it fits with the Feng Shui of the place it’s in. So, how’d it work out?Pros:• Sound quality is definitely better (in my space).• Woo-Hoo, I’ve got a hub!• This particular edition, the Red, suits my decor schema perfectlyCons• The microphone doesn’t work well. I’ve enough devices that this is largely immaterial, but let’s just say it’s obvious that’s this is not the device I’m talking to. That’s kinda sad as that also means I’m rarely interacting with Alexa over the new chipset.• Sad but true: As others have noted 4th generation devices do not pair with other generation devices. Sad. I can’t use this as part of a stereo pair. (Here’s hoping Amazon issues a software patch!)	3	January 12, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have 3 of these things now, all different flavors. I need to speak louder for this unit to hear me. And when I speak louder the one in the kitchen hears me. Maybe I missed a sensitivity setting somewhere.	3	February 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I had a 1st Gen Alexa. She was tall, elegant, and dare I say graceful. But as all things do, she died. I think her carcass is around here somewhere. This new Alexa came and she's pretty - one big bubble. But her voice recognition skills are terrible. If I'm playing the Jeopardy app I had to have meditated ahead of time in order to have the patience for the 18 times it craps out during the game. I miss Alex Trebek, but it makes me want to kill him. When she eventually comes down off her high horse long enough to play music, she's very fickle about what she'll play. She'll play Billy Joel, but don't even think about asking her to play music from Encanto. She'll make you feel dumb for wasting her time by asking.Do yourself a favor and take care of your 1st or 2nd Gen Echo. They're a rare breed and deserve all the love, care, and attention you can give them.	2	December 21, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Not for people who are technically deficient.  I'm not good with computers and associated items - this item requires troubleshooting at times and is above my pay grade.  Not as simple as they make you believe.  😉	3	January 31, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I occasionally have to yell to get it's attention. The internal thermometer needs to be better calibrated, as it's a couple of degrees off.Bass quality is big, and music is clear.	3	March 5, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have multiple echo devices and in general think they're great. I was disappointed a bit that this 4th gen device was not as good at recognizing its wake word ('Alexa'), as my older echo devices.  With the 4th generation device I have to be very careful to directly face the unit and enunciate when using the wake word.  My older units do not require this.(FWIW - I've altered the positioning of this 4th gen device a few times to ensure it wasn't some sort of audio bouncing that was the issue. The unit performs the same regardless of its location.)Also, unlike my older devices, this 4th generation Echo seems to often just not respond if it cannot answer or properly interpret a voice command/request.  I can see the wake word activates the unit but then it does not respond to commands it has trouble with. I have mixed feelings about this.  I don't miss the occasional 'I did not understand that request' (paraphrasing the response older Echo devices used.) but at the same time really dislike the device just going silent as though nothing had been said - and forcing me to wake it again.To be clear - the issues with this 4th generation device are truly minor.I remain a big fan of echo devices and Alexa in general.Solid build quality, excellent speech interpretation, amazing performance overall.	2	March 13, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Sound: 3/5Design: 2/5Alexa Hub: 4/5Mic: 2/5I was looking forward to getting the 4th generation echo, I wasn't sure about it after reading all the reviews but I thought I will give it a try anyhow.I had the 1st generation Echo which was getting replaced by the 4th generation. I didn't really care for the 4th generation sphere design but I had hoped that the technology will make up for it. I was wrong the Echo Dot in the other room answers my questions 😂🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ very disappointed!!! Never had such an issue with 1st generation Echo, now I think why did I replace it in the first place. It even used to prompt if I got the response from the right device.The most disappointing is the Amazon support not helpful at all. When I reached out to the Chat support they gave me the excuse device software was out of date, I asked why it didn't update automatically, they told me device needs to be idle for half hour. Forget during the day when everyone is awake, it didn't find an idle time at night as well when everyone was asleep 🤣😂I was able to reproduce the issue today, I asked the Echo 3 questions but every time the Echo Dot in the different room responded and when I called Amazon support, they asked me to reproduce the issue even though they could see in my voice history which device responded to the questions.I tried to reproduce the issue when I was on call, it didn't happen, they said we will call in an hour. I never heard back from Amazon support and instead got an email saying they couldn't reach me. Very disappointed!!Verdict: I won't suggest to upgrade...poor device and very horrible customer service. 1st generation Echo was definitely louder and I preferred the overall design. The issues with the mic are annoying.P.S. Don't give excuses to someone who is from software industry 😏	1	February 19, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Before this device I used a Google Nest.  The voice recognition on the Amazon Echo does not compare to Google Nest.  The Amazon Echo, gets confused about 40% of the times, this never happened with the Google Nest.  After 6 months of use, Alexa goes silent (no light) and the only way to fix this is to unplug and re-plug the device.  I have been patiently doing this, hoping the issue was going to get fixed on its own but for the last two month the issue is occurring more and more often and I now need to unplug/re-plug the device about every 2-3 days.  Another issue with the device is I usually have it at a low volume to listen to my tv (line in) and during the day I raise the volume but at the same time, Alexa’s volume is raised so when I say a command, Alexa is extremely loud.  I wish Alexa’s volume was separate to avoid this. Now let’s talk about warranty coverage...  It's unbelievably painful to find and get to warranty support for this device.  Once I found the link to chat, I was on a chat troubleshooting for about 2 hours.  At the end, when the agent decided to process the warranty, she wanted me to ship the item first to Amazon, wait a few days for them to process it and then send me the replacement.  The agent then told me she couldn't process it and asked me to delete my home address and re-enter (to check, if that was going to allow her to process the request).  I requested to have a supervisor call me and as I'm writing this, I'm still waiting for the supervisor to take some type of action.	1	September 9, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Worst thing about Alexa is the constant “By the Way…”. I don’t care what you are selling, just perform the task I asked and move on.	3	March 25, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	So, we’ve had the 4th gen for a year and a half. I understand the updated echo can hear you over loud music, however, the echo still fails to understand word & names when we request songs. It’s so bad that we have to walk over to the echo to repeat ourselves. Sometimes I have to spell words and names. Can’t wait for the newest addition, or for a sale on an older edition.	2	June 23, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	"Compré esperando que tenga un mejor reconocimiento de voz que mi echo dot de la misma generación; sin embargo, a pesar de tener más micrófonos según las especificaciones técnicas, tiene un mal reconocimiento inclusive para activarse, a veces hay que repetir fuerte y en varias ocasiones el comando de activación ""Alexa"""	3	January 4, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	My Dots alert me when Amazon delivers immediate. The Dot can hear me 15 feet away while this one only 5 feet. The Ball alerts my Amazon orders up to 12 hours after the Dot. Sounds good but hard of hearing.	3	January 19, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I really liked my gen 2 echo. This new one does not sound as nice. Doesn’t look as nice. It has a white cord that does not match, and Alexa turns up the volume when I say “Alexa turn off”. I’ll play with the EQ more but the Gen 2 sounded great out of the box. Lights on the bottom are also annoying.	3	December 1, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"This is a good speaker/alexa. Here's the problem: the marketing tells you that you can pair this echo with a fire tv ""to feel scenes come to life with home theater audio."" The reality is that audio can only come from EITHER your tv's speakers OR your echo. NOT BOTH. It isn't a home theater experience at all unless you want to buy multiple echo devices. And then it is only possible to pair the fire tv with a maximum of 2 echo devices and a sub. So even if you want to spend extra money, it's going to be a subpar ""home theater"" experience.  It took me an hour on customer service getting passed around before I was told that it was impossible to get sound from both the tv speakers and the echo at the same time (despite the fact that it will do this to play music, according to customer support it is not possible while watching tv). Hopefully this review will save others some time!"	3	December 27, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	device is unresponsive or does not answer questions correctly or play requests for music. nor will Alexa stop when it starts with the weong request.  I would like to slow down responses as the speech from alexa is often too fast to understand and respond.	3	January 10, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I purchased a 4th gen Echo dot, but meant to purchase a 4th gen Echo.  A few days later, there was a price drop on the 4th gen Echo, so I bought one and compared them.First, I should've realized the price dropped for a reason... the reviews which state that the Echo mic is bad are so true.  I have to speak so loud (even when no other sounds in the room), I can be heard two rooms away.When Alexa does respond, there's a serious lag and the volume temporarily decreases (long enough that I thought I'd accidentally asked Alexa to lower the volume) only to realize this happens every time I ask Alexa anything.The Echo sound is relatively full.  However, I prefer the midrange of the Echo dot.I don't care for either device as a single speaker so I tried to pair the Echo and the Echo dot.What??  Each speaker pairs individually with FireTV, smart light bulbs, etc., but an Echo and Echo dot will only work together for music and, possibly, audio books.They CAN'T BE PAIRED together for stero listening with, e.g., FireTV.  I researched this to ensure I wasn't missing something and all web results verified this issue.  Please let me know if I'm wrong!Bottom line, I'll be returning the 4th gen Echo for sure.  Might keep the 4th gen Echo dot.	2	February 26, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	The goodClear audio at low and mid volume. Temperature sensor is a nice addition.The neutralHas some kind of onboard voice processor but I don't notice any improvements to voice recognition or response speed as a result.The badDoesn't hear me as well as my 3rd Gen EchoDoesn't sound good above 50% volume - it's as if the device just increases the treble only and can't increase volume on low-mid frequency beyond the 50% threshold. Above 70% it starts to distort, above 80% it's distorted to all heck. Would be better if the max volume was limited to match the device capabilities instead of allowing users to crank beyond the distortion threshold. Essentially, in the current state we only get 5 usable volume levels. Above that it just sounds terrible.For reference, the 3rd Gen echo I find to sound decent up to about 70% volume before noticeable distortion occurred. In addition the 3rd Gen can actually hear me so I'd just recommend skipping the 4th generation.	3	December 6, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	At low volume levels this speaker is just average, a little tincanish even.  The sound is clear in the mid-range, but flat in the wings..  If there is an equalizer it is impossible to find.  Not nearly as good as the original Echo.  But, you need a hub, this is the only choice.  It also skips occasionally, WiFi connection was better on a Dot I had in the same location. The ball design makes the thing an accident waiting to roll off whatever surface. There should be a nesting ring to keep the goofy thing from rolling away.  It is impractical when handling, in that locating controls is mostly visual and not tactile.  Dust sticks to it.  On the plus side in a tiny room it is less disappointing.  In a open area, forget it.	3	June 6, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Can't access enough info.  Responds before I ask the full question.  Quits playing songs by any particular singer after a small number.  Doesn't know what I asked sometimes.	3	February 22, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I’ve had the original Alexa for about 6 years now and I wanted an upgrade. I purchased this speaker thinking it would be better in sound quality but I was disappointed. The sound quality is sub par and it does not turn up very loud if you like to blast your music like I do while cleaning, cooking or taking a shower. The main reason why I returned my purchase is because it just stopped connecting to my WiFi. No matter what I tried, it would not connect. There were a few other annoying glitches that I dealt with that I never had happen with the original speaker. The thing that I did enjoy was the color changing light bulb that came with it. Other than that, I’ll just continue using my old speaker. It actually connects and sounds better than the newer version.	2	January 31, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	It works as well as any of our Alexa products. Bought this one to upgrade my original dot, but it’s going back, because no one in the house likes it’s sphere shape…will have to wait for the next redesign.	3	January 26, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"This makes no sense.  We purchased a black echo for a reason.  So it would blend in on our black counter with black backsplash.  Now we have a big, white plug and white cord sticking out like a ""sore thumb.""  Why can't you send a black cord with a black echo???"	2	July 11, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	I loved this device until I played techno music and busted the speaker.  It was between volume 3 and 4 which isn’t loud at all, and it busted it due to the bass.  I didn’t change the bass setting on my echo either.	3	January 9, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Update: Changed up to 3 stars. I received a call from amazon and they helped me fix the long delay issue. You cannot have it give a tone when you say the wake word, something that I liked. The bad is that the temp sensor is always way off. I have 2 different sensors in the same room to check and it's about 10deg off. I got this so that I can have it turn on and off an ac unit at specific temps. The room gets over 80deg while the rest of the house is like 70deg. The sensor in the echo will say it's 71 but all the other sensors will say 80 in this room.Update: changed this to a 1 star. I constantly have to repeat commands to my echo and then it will take about 60 seconds to complete them, if it ever does complete them.Love the sound quality but it takes longer than my 3rd gen echo dot did to execute commands.	3	October 27, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	The sound and look of the speaker is great however as mentioned in other reviews, the microphone is really bad, it literally SUCKS!!! I bought 2 echos, one for my living room and another for my bedroom, both sit at about 5-6 ft away from where I regularly speak to them from and when they are not reproducing anything I have a hard time getting them to hear me. Not to mention when the music is on, especially on high volume, you literally have to SCREAM to have a possibility of them hearing you. This is both with the dot and echo 4th gen, for comparison I have 3rd gen echo dots, echo show 5 and echo flex, needless to say they all hear me waaaaay easier, to give an idea of this: I have an echo flex out in my hallway outside of my bedroom and sometimes it hears me before the echo in the room, despite it being easily an additional 5ft away with walls in the way. It's very disappointing that they downgraded the microphones on these for whatever the reason, especially because one of it's main features to sell is you being able to communicate through voice, for this reason I have to give it a 2 star rating regardless of all it's pros. I really hope Amazon look into this and either gives a recall or some sort of update that can fix this problem	2	February 18, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Bought these to connect to Samsung tv, connection works great . However you need to disconnect it from tv before turning off tv. If you don't Alexa stops communicating,  you literally have to unplug the speaker  to get it back to communicating!	3	January 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I recently upgraded from the old, tall Alexa to this new 4th generation version.  I also got a new Echo Dot with clock.  I loved my old Alexa Echo and old Alexa Dot.  I am not so happy with these newer versions.  Perhaps it's the new shape, but it's clear that the new devices do not pick up on sound as well as the older versions did.  I have to constantly repeat ""Alexa"" to get their attention.  Is the new dome shame inhibiting them in some way?  And also very annoying is the fact that because the light is now at the bottom of the device, instead of at the top of a tower, it's not seen as easily.  So sometimes, Alexa may hear, but the light is not visible.  Why did you ruin a good thing?  The dome shape is not nearly as appealing and it doesn't do the job as well.  Very disappointing."	3	January 12, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Tried this out, compared this to our existing Echo and sound quality was better.  Been in use in our great room and her hearing us was not good.  Tried it in about 4 locations and not very good hearing.  Have moved it to our bedroom, still doesn't hear well, but then it isn't used as much.	3	December 7, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I feel bamboozled. I have owned every Echo/Echo+, and every time it has gotten progressively better. I’ve really enjoyed watching a well-made product get better and better with no major downsides for years. I actually look forward to buying the new generation each time.So I’m really, really disappointed with this fourth generation. Its smaller form factor means its microphone is physically located much closer to its base, so if you had your Echo+ on a side table (like me), expect your experience to take a serious nosedive. I repeat myself four or five times, getting louder each time sometimes. I have an echo dot in the next room and about 25% of the time IT picks up before the Echo 4th gen does.An overall downgrade, unfortunately. Making devices smaller is not always an improvement. Maybe the mics are placed in worse locations, I don’t pretend to know.	2	January 13, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Do you enjoy manually turning the speaker in your direction every time you move around the room? Well, you'll be glad to hear that Amazon has an Echo for you! It only plays out of one side - revolutionary! Just pick it up whenever you move and turn the speaker in your direction!Seriously a terrible product, but when compared to Apple home pod.....it's still awful just not as awful as Apple home pod. Setting the bar high is not part of the strategy.  Which brings me to this:  if you want to play anything other than Amazon branded content - you will have to be prepared to battle the device constantly as it refuses to acknowledge that you have the default set to competitor subscriptions. Apple Music is Alexa's arch rival! She will do anything to keep you away from your music. She will try to shove Amazon music subscriptions down your throat even though you have Prime! (Hmmm- need to get rid of that then...).  I can deal with the poor sound quality but not frequent devious detours back to Amazon music as the default and having to reconnect my Apple account. I don't want to hear anymore reasons, I just want the games to stop!	2	September 4, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	I am a  disabled woman confined to a power wheelchair most of my life. I live on a small fixed income. I have an older affordable flip cell phone. I received the Alexia as a Christmas gift. I was so thrilled until I discovered I need a phone with the ability of applications to use the Alexia. I looked at the prices of smartphones and they are far out of my price range. WHY, did you make Alexia work on applications? And WHY didn't you just build the application into the Alexia? Now I can't use it at all until I can afford to buy a smartphone. So angry with you, I just sat and cried when I found this out. It's always all about making as much money as possible, isn't it? So glad there are fewer days ahead of me than behind me. I will probably never get to use it. I have grown weary of this world of greedy money and power hungry people.	3	January 1, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Heavy on the bass with next to no treble.  The mic, as with all Echo devices are horrible.  The noise cancelation and ability to block its own sound are laughable.Edit 5/30/2021: I got a call within 8 minutes of posting this review. I was shocked but it was customer service to address my concerns. That level of Customer Care is unheard of and for that reason alone I would recommend using the Alexa devices. As for their tips; they showed me my area of lack of knowledge and how to correct it. In the app you can adjust the Bass, Mid, and Treble I didn't know that. Having made this changes the sound is far better. For the mic they had me remove and resync the devices. This shad had a somewhat positive result but it is still to early to be 100% sure. I would say accuracy has gone up 50% but still not fully there. I hope this can be figured out further with software updates. I will update this again in a few months to see if it has changed. For now I highly recommend the devices for the interface, flexibility, sound, price, and the absolute boss level Customer Care. Mic still needs work but it is minor at this point compared to all the other things.	2	May 25, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	MATCH THE COLOR OF THE CORD TO THE DEVICE... or, don't offer color choices at all! Simple.The sound quality is... meh. Not great, to bass-y and not well balanced. Alexa is borderline mentally disabled and not useful for much.Save your money, voice recognition isn't ready for prime time. None of the devices work very well.	3	December 3, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Fourth time with 4th Generation Echo was NOT the charm.We have the older Echo as well as the Echo Dot. These work great. This new Echo is awful!We are now on our THIRD 4th generation Echo. The first one (Round One) hooked up beautifully to all our devices, but was totally hard of hearing. We would stand 2 feet away from Alexa and scream to get her to respond. This device is located on our main floor. The device in our bedroom a floor up and rooms away would respond before the one two feet away did. So Amazon send us a new one. This was after spending 45 minutes on the phone with customer service.Round Two 4th generation hears perfectly well but is completely was unable to connect with out two brand new Philips Hue light bulbs which were part of the package that came with Round One. Chatted first with someone in the US on fixing this. Seemed like we might be getting somewhere but she put me on hold. Next thing I knew I was talking with someone in India (I think) explaining the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN. He put be through to someone in the Philippines. Starting from scratch AGAIN I was on the phone with her for 57 minutes!!! It was truly the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result! She finally says something is wrong with your 4th generation ECHO and ships me another new one.Round Three 4th generation Echo arrives today. Same nightmare as Round Two. Spent 40 minutes on the phone with Amazon Customer services. He states that the only literature he has to go off of is really old!!! Echo is STILL NOT ABLE TO SEE new Philips Hue Lights! He tells me to contact Philips Hue.I've now been on the phone with Philips Hue for 60 minutes! Still not working.Amazon's customer service is NOT knowledgeable about this issue!	1	December 22, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	Not to much louder than a small regular echo dot in my opinion.  If you're looking for good stereo sound or quality this is not the device for that. It gets the job done to allow you to hear some whistle wile you work music or audio books but that is all.	3	December 13, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Updating - now pretty much unusable. Doesn’t pick up our voice at allUpdating - over time, it has gotten worse. I talk directly to it,  but it never responds. All of the devices in the other rooms much further away answer. Even with an update, the microphone doesn’t work well.Updating my review to one less star. I have an Alexa in my kitchen, my living room (this one) , and my bedroom. Both are dots. You can be standing in the living room talking to the device over it, and the other Alexas respond to you. The microphone is awful. Thinking about returning. I stopped delivery on the 3 to order the 4 when it came out. Now, I wish I didn’t.My black device came with a horrible looking white aftermarket cord that is not Amazon original ; at least match the color.  It sounds ok; I have Alexa devices all around my house and compared to the dot, I think it’s honestly just ok. Not amazing.	1	October 22, 2020	0

Echo 4th Gen	I had gen 1,3 and some other.long story short: this is not better, just more expensive. Save your money. Go for the previous  gen. Half the price and pick up our voices before this one does....I DO NOT RECOMMEND!- doesnt recognize / hear well (no better than gen 1 and 3 if not worse)- microphone seems even more directional... an issue since we place it in the middle but unless you talk AT it or yell... well you just have to yell- sound quality is not great. I dont use alexa for music and I surely will not with this thing (dont listen the reviews of pcmag etc... bs... this thing is terrible)- WHITE cable? For a black alexa? Why?... so it sticks out?- the ball shape - it is not good looking and it makes the thing stick out even more when i need it to melt in the background. Let’s face it: it s not a piece of art so the quieter it is visually, the better.Bottom line is it s not an upgrade. It’s the same product as before, more expensive, uglier. We are disappointed they haven’t improved the microphone.If you don’t have one, the cheaper one is the way to go. If you have one... don’t upgrade - amazon does NOT offer such a thing.

Echo 4th Gen	Initial setup was a breeze.  But failed multiple times when trying to get it to join existing Alexa groups already in the house, because it was 'unrecognized network'.  Only way to have all the Echo speaker groups to integrate was to reset router (Nighthawk Mesh) to factory settings and rebuild the entire house network of wi-fi devices using new network name and password, which took alot of time.	3	November 5, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Many times I asked a question and I would be given a totally different answer.  I never had this problem with google dot.	3	March 7, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I own the original Echo and love it. The new model is a disappointment. First, I find the sound quality to be lacking, worse than the 1st edition. It is pretty fuzzy and is really distorted at higher volumes.Also the new Echo does not include a remote. This wouldn't be a problem if the voice recognition worked better. As it is I find myself screaming at the darn thing to get it to respond. I have driven myself crazy  trying to sync the two devices to play at the same time. They never play the same thing together, and half the time one plays while the other talks about something unrelated to the request. They occasionally get the fire-tv stick in on the action, just for fun. I still haven't figured it out.I have the original Echo in my living room and the new Echo in the bedroom. They are a full room and hallway apart from one another. If I am on the couch the Echo in the bedroom responds and if I am in the  bedroom standing right next to the new Echo, the one in the living room responds. This is ridiculously annoying.I'm actually annoyed with myself for getting so annoyed by what is essentially a first world problem. Arghh.  ""Alexa, play the meditation station."""	2	April 28, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	We replaced a couple order Alexa units with these because they were supposed to have much better sound.  They sort of due.  They have much better directional sound, but don't fill a space/room as well as the older non-directional units.THe biggest annoyance is these are much worse at voice recognition, they are always struggling to hear us, and when they do hear us they frequently mistake the command.  These are in the exact same locations as our old units that worked great.	2	May 21, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	It has had some problems with setting on the volume. It kept returning to the factory setting of 3 witch was way way too low. I called about this and had a hard time under standing what I was being told to fix it right now it's volume is stable so far.	3	December 9, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	It can’t hear you when the tv is on.  It says it has adaptive volume, I’ve heard no evidence that this is true.  I ask it to change volume and it periodically tells me “that feature is not supported”.  I don’t understand why the reminders volume is not set by the alarm volume.  Reminders whisper and alarms sound fine.  My echo dot seems to be far more reliable than the echo.	3	October 28, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Me: “Alexa, lights on.”“Several things share the name ‘lights,’ which one do you want?”Me: “All of them!”“There’s no device named ‘all of them.’”Me: “Alexa, lights on!!!”*lights turn on*	3	February 3, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	"As a speaker, it's good. Sounds nice. Understands me well. And can be helpful with many tasks and reminders, but what ruins it for me is Amazon uses it unapologetically to constantly advertise and make sales. It is intrusive.For instance, ask it for the weather and after giving you a response, it says, ""By the way, I can now recommend gift ideas. Would you like to hear one now?""Seriously?! Who thought that I would need a smart speaker that spends it's time trying to convince me to buy more crap. How is that going to make life better?I've turned all the settings off for advertising, but it ignored it in this case as it doesn't think that gift ideas is another form of advertising. If this continues, I will be selling all of my Amazon stuff and dumping them altogether.I don't need a billboard in my house. Maybe I'll try Google smart speakers instead."	2	December 19, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	"It claims I can add other speakers to it and have surround sound in my entire house.  So I followed the instructions to get my existing Bose speakers added as devices, than created the groups.  It will play one of the Bose speakers, tried the other but failed to connect, and doesn't play itself when it plays the one Bose speaker it does play.  I want all three speakers (including the Echo) playing the same thing in synch, controlled by Alexa.  When I tried to get Alexa to do it she asks for a speaker to group, I say ""SoundTouch"" and she says she can't find ""SoundTouch"" then searches and says ""I found SoundTouch, should I add that speaker?""  Duh, that's what I asked for."	3	July 1, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Was a pretty good deal for the upgrade until I received it....  It's a black echo with a white cord.  What an eye sore.  They also used a cheap stadard plug this time.  Definitely a  down grade.	3	January 2, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Bout this to replace my gen 1 in my living room. My gen 1 is now in the basement. This new one can’t hear worth a damn. Have to yell even when I’m only 6 feet away.

Echo 4th Gen	"So i lost my connector for my smart lights and my friend said hey alexa works with them regardless So i was all for it... Until i received it and wow... sound quality is wonky set it to 10 talks really loud but that's it, alarms will be quiet music eh and the quality of the music is subpar.. so yeah.  Now Voice recognition is dumb it'll just randomly activate for no reason no prompting no one saying anything close to ALEXA nothing... now some of the apps are kinda cool for it but not worth.. most of them you have to buy which is dumb and just greedy and then ask it anything and it'll say ""I do not know that"" or something similar i could ask my Google home ANYTHING and it would try to answer me... i could ask it to convert 62.23 USD to CAN and it would no problems but ask Alexa ""I do not know that"" i could ask google home ANYTHING and i would get an answer and yeah some of the more Vague ones with google would get me some randomish or not exactly what i wanted but atleast it would try and would get something close instead of a big Pile of Nothing... i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this period, especially over a google home or even a google home mini"	2	February 18, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	The sound of this speaker is great but if you plan on using 2 or more of them in parallel, go with something else.  I purchased 2 of the echo 4th gen speakers and in 2 different homes(on 2 different internet/wifi systems) they would regularly cut out at least every other song.  As such I bought 2 of the new echo dots, and have them bluetoothed to much better speakers and have save >$100.  Sadly, with the 2 brand new echo dots, I am still getting the cut out and at times static but only when I am playing the music over multiple dots.  The echo 4th gen speakers are being returned as the cost does not justify the music regularly cutting out.  I'm sure that at some point they will figure out how to run multiple echo speakers/dots without the music cutting out or high levels of static, but until then I am going to cut my losses.	3	December 12, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	Every request fulfilled by this horrible box comes with an added request from the box.What's the weather?It's 65 degress outside.  *Do you also want to know the humidity?*What time is it?It's 9 am.  *By the way, I can also set timers and alarms.  Would you like to try that now?*Every.  Single. Request. Comes with an additional comment, question or suggestion.  I can't get this thing to do what it used to do when I bought it... Answer simple questions without adding interruptions.  I now own an obnoxious paperweight.Do not buy any Amazon product.  There are always strings attached.	1	September 20, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	My echo plus recognizes my voice better that this echo.	3	April 15, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Don't think it's recognition is as good as my older echo. The sound is better but the sacrifice is the size and form of the object. Guess I'll live with it for now.	3	February 1, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Had the echo for guess going on 6 months.  Was great to begin with.  Sound is decent and really only thing i use it for is controlling lights.  For the past month or so though the damn ring light will come on white and just spin all the time.  I chatted with  customer service a couple weeks ago and their fix was to uninstall the app on my phone then unplug and plug back in the echo.  So that fixed it while chatting.  Two days later started doing it again and now some days it goes 24 - 48 hours straight.  The echo dot in my bedroom did it once at night.  So getting to the point to unplug them both and see what my options are from there.  Very frustrating!!!  I did the remove the app and reboot them again one evening and again that fixed it for like a day.	3	December 29, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	This product is fine. I just thought that something listed as having premium sound would have a better bass note. Especially with the size.	3	March 3, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	We have had all of the different models through the years and have one in every room. This is by far the one we have the most problems with from doing simple commands. We constantly have to unplug this one to reset. Would skip this one.	3	December 22, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	There are times the voice recognition won't acknowledge and there are times when the Bluetooth won't pair with my external speaker bar.  Unfortunately these occurances aren't consistent so I cannot spot a trend in these behaviors.	3	January 18, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have three Echo V3 and now the new Echo V4. I find that the Echo 4 sounds not much better but can be louder and is comparably a bit deaf. Also both versions (as well as the Echo Dot) have extremely low signal level on the auxiliary output making connection to a powered speaker or a stereo receiver difficult without some intermediate gain device. As to being deaf, the Echo 4 requires that one must be very close (4-5 feet) or to yell in order for Alexa to receive commands. Also, there is no remote available for Echo 4. The Echo V3 has no such issues and easily understands commands from a reasonable distance (across the room) using a moderate voice level.I have relegated my Echo 4 to a small room and brought back the Echo 3 to the kitchen where I use it most, sometimes with the remote when others are conversing in the room.	3	February 24, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Of all my Echo speakers, I'm most disappointed with this one.  I should've just purchased a second 3rd gen.The 4th gen's sound doesn't carry as far.  It won't pair with my Echo remote.  It doesn't want to pair with anything via Bluetooth.My two biggest complaints are the reaction time and dropped connection.I have my Echo 4th gen is by far the slowest to light-up when I say ""Alexa.""  My 1st gen is faster.When playing music everywhere, the speaker will sometimes stop playing.  The rest of my echo devices throughout the house will continue to play, but the 4th gen will drop out, even though it's still connected to WiFi.  I found that if I just wait, it'll start playing again, but only for a few seconds, and then it'll prematurely force the system to skip to the next song.What I do like... I guess the fabric cover is nice."	3	January 2, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"I purchased 4 of these units to replace 2nd generation dots in various parts of the house. They arrived, and after setup I have noted that the new Echos are slower to respond and be ready to accept commands than the original Dots.If you say ""Alexa"" the original dot is ready within about a second to be listening, but the new units are two to three seconds slower to even begin listening so now instead of saying ""Alexa what is the weather today"" you have to say,""Alexa........"" go have a coffee, twiddle thumbs,""..................what is the weather today."" They are also definitely slower than the google home units. This appears to have been a big step backwards in regards to speed. But that could also be because of the new AZ1 chips in them.But, with that said, the sound quality is a lot better than the old unit, doesn't make up for the lags in responses, but it does make for a better music streaming experience."	3	November 23, 2020	1
Echo 4th Gen	I was tired of waking up to a beeping alarm and always hitting snooze so many times that I was frequently getting to work later than I wanted. So, as a solution, I bought an Amazon Echo to one simple task: wake me up to what is essentially a commercial-free radio of my own music library. Alexa doesn't even have the capability to do that! If I pick a playlist to wake me up, it ALWAYS starts with the first song on the playlist, and it ALWAYS starts with shuffle mode turned off. I've tried asking it to shuffle my playlist when setting my alarm, leaving Spotify on shuffle the night before, and asking Alexa to turn shuffle mode on the night before, but none of them work--it wakes me up with shuffle off. Why is this simple wish so difficult to fulfill? I couldn't find an iPhone app that does this, which is why I bought an Echo. Alas, it appears software that can execute this very basic concept still has not been sufficiently developed for iPhone users. I am jealous of the Android users that have Google clock.	2	October 13, 2021	0

Echo 4th Gen	"My original Echo finally died and I recently bought this newer/round model. I use use my Echo as an alarm clock/Timer/Reminder. I have it positioned on top of a medium height bookshelf about 10 feet away from where I sleep.  I find I am constantly shouting at my Echo. ""ALEXA, SNOOZE!"" ALEXA! ALEXA! ALEXXXXXXA SNOOZE! It's not the best way to wake up in the morning.I feel like the distance and direction of which you are talking to it matters. If I hang my head off the bed to shout it seems to work better :POtherwise works great to listen to music while I work , reminders and timers."	3	July 22, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have a home in Florida and a Home in New York when I play the echo in Florida it interferes with a unit in New York somebody was at my home using it and it ceased to work, Also playing Amazon music on my cell phone cause issues with echoes playing music at the house	3	December 4, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"The first few months I had this I don't recall ever having to reset the device(pulling power cord out and in).Now about every week it will light up letting me know it heard ""Alexa,"" but never respond and eventually go back to sleep. No smart switch commands will execute or anything, the only fix is to reset it. This is a major problem when I've set an alarm or reminder and Alexa now won't activate those alarms/reminders.And no... This has nothing to do with my internet. I have 1:1 gb fiber. Also I'm a software engineer with a part time job as a server administrator. I know my network and machines better than anyone, and this device is simply screwing up."	2	February 20, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	Bought this to replace an Echo Plus cylinder unit that is connected to a sub woofer. That original configuration worked and sounded great. Suddenly with that one playlists would no longer consistently play, if at all. So, bought this 4 gen device thinking it would be comparable or better than the EP. Unfortunately, the sound is not as good and unit does not “listen” as well either. Have bought many of these devices since they hit the market. This is the first time being disappointed by one. It’s a step back- what a disappointment.	2	April 26, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	The sound is only a wee bit better than the previous model. However, the light ring at the base of the orb is far too bright and too large. There is no way to disable this unnecessary light ring. I buy speakers to listen to them not to watch them. I rate this product a fail for the inability of users to disable the light ring.The light ring feature on the new Echo 4th gen is a complete failure. It is too large. It is too bright. When I mute the microphone it glows bright red for no good reason since the microphone button is also glowing red. The designers of the device failed. I should be able to turn  off the light ring completely. But I can't even adjust its brightness. I can't use this device where I wanted since it always calls too much visual attention to itself. I don't need a light ring. My Google Nest Audio Speaker, which costs about the same as the Echo 4th generation, does not call unwarranted attention to itself, like the Amazon device.The Echo worthless to me and I expect to return it and replace it with another Google Nest Audio Speaker. I prefer the functionality of Alexa and the Alexa app over Google Assistant but the physical speaker's appearance and sound matter more than all the wiz-bang features of either system.	2	December 2, 2020	0
Echo 4th Gen	Love the sound but the speaker already sounds semi blown after a month. Not sure if it’s due to it being a refurb.  Sound is still ok but I’ve never turned the volume past 60%.	3	January 17, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	The one closest to me will play deaf on occasion. The one on the opposite side of the room will on occasion respond, but it seems the older echo’s (generation before this) now relocated to the kitchen and bedroom (approximately 20 feet away in either direction) seem to respond to commands better than the two new ones, I never had this issue with my older ones. They’ve all been reassigned locations under the Alexa app. Strange to hear the Echo’s in the kitchen and bedroom respond to commands compared to the one within arm reach.A LOT better sound than the previous generation though, not to Bose quality but a lot better!	3	July 19, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Very nice device! I would love to have given it 5 stars, but the voice / command recognition is below par. I sometimes find myself yelling at it, before it finally wakes up to follow directives. The neighbors must think I'm out of my mind!! Also, when I for example ask about the wind speed of certain regions, it's never gotten it right once. It's generally lower, off by at least 10 mph! I always have to revert to asking Google which gets it right. I hope Amazon will do an update for at least the voice recognition. That would be awesome, since otherwise it works pretty well with the attached smart devices, once it finally wakes up!	3	July 10, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have 1 Echo and 2 Echo dots, and they always confuse which should play the music. When I talk to the Echo dot on the 2nd floor to play music, the Echo on the first floor plays it....	3	December 24, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I wanted to love this product. I bought two to use with my fire stick as a home theater option. It worked for 3 days then simply stopped working. The speakers would pair,but wouldn’t play sound. Individually the speakers would work, but when paired (any way) no sound would come out. I reset and started from square one multiple times on each product and it never worked again. To top it off, I had 3 30min-60 min conversations with Alexa help desk where they tried the exact same solutions, wrote a trouble ticket and said they would call me back with a solution. I spoke with 3 separate people who never called back… the first phone call was over a week ago, so I gave enough time.I have now returned the products and am been reluctant to purchase and echo Device again. Apple May have less products to integrate… but at least the ones it has will work. Highly disappointed.	2	December 6, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	To start i'll say that the sound quality is better than the small dot but not great by any means. The voice recognition is absolutely horrible. I can stand right next to it and it is a 50/50 shot if it will react when i give a voice command. Now i use it to control an echo link and when you pause and tell it to resume then it isn't even smart enough to go back to the same source that it was playing from prior to pausing. Amazon products are starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth and this is no exception. Save your money.	1	September 23, 2022	0
Echo 4th Gen	Needs improvement I think it’s about Time that Amazon does something about The problem that Alexa has trouble understanding requests I see no improvement in that area since the first Amazon echo that I purchased it’s about time Amazon makes The necessary improvements.	3	December 13, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Echo 4th generation temperature are not working.  It’s will announce the temperature in the house if you ask.  But I want it to setting the temperature routine to trigger the ceiling fan when the room above 74 Fahrenheit to turn the ceiling fan on, it not doing it.  So I call in for tech support several time to get help, I got nothing out of it.  Thought, they did told me the the echo 4th generation are unable to trigger ceiling through temperature control routine.  They say that the echo 4th gen only can tell the temperature in the if you ask but that is it.  But when I read on the echo 4th gen routine it clearly stated that through routine it can be set to activate ceiling fan when the temperature above or below certain degree automatically without have to manually gone through Alexa app to turn it on.  Do anyone have echo 4th gen have the issue?  The experience I have with technical support are very unpleasant, she is rude, and she hang up the phone on me.  I have been using google home and think about switching to Alexa but now due to the unpleasantly rude and unwillingly to work helping to fix the issue.  Hmm maybe switching to Amazon Alexa devices are not the way to go.  That’s it just too bad.	1	February 24, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	I bought an entire Alexa speaker set-up (two echos, a sub, and an echo link) thinking I would use it as a home theater for both my TV and record player. It's an absolute nightmare to use. The speakers never connect correctly via wifi, the volume levels for the TV are too low, playing a record through the link works about 50% of the time. Unfortunately, I waited too long to return but I'll be selling these and buying a Sonos system.	1	October 11, 2022	0

Echo 4th Gen	I had two of the original Alexas, the tall ones. One still worked great, the other one kept stopping for no reason so I thought I would update. Big mistake.  First of all, I don't like the blue ring being on the bottom, I can't always see it so I don't know if Alexa is responding. 2nd of all, I hate the volume button. It also does not go as loud as my other Alexa. I do not notice any improvement in the sound quality. I also don't think Alexa responds as well as the taller one. The only advantage is the pause button, so I can put Alexa to sleep while my 3 yo grandson is visiting so he'll stop yelling at her to do things. I should have known newer does not always make for better. I bought the larger echo and the smaller echo, for a smaller area upstairs. Disappointed with both.	3	January 21, 2021	1

Echo 4th Gen	My goodness. This thing is a pain in the butt. I bought this to replace my 3rd gen echo. First thing I noticed is the mic barely hears me. My 3rd gen echo hears me loud and clear even when music is blasting I've whispered to it to test it and it heard me fine, but this 4th gen needs to be yelled at 98% of the time I'm less than a foot away from it. Second, I noticed when I played my playlist it had songs missing, so it tells me if I want the missing songs back I have to upgrade to amazon music unlimited for $7.99 a month which makes no sense cause I'm doing amazon music unlimited for  $2.99 a month already. I plugged my 3rd gen back in and the songs on my playlist all came back free of charge and were all there. So I plug my 4th gen back in hoping somehow the issue fixed itself and it's back to telling me I need to pay $7.99 a month again. Seriously? What's wrong with this dysfunctional product? I might return it if it's gonna keep acting like a cheap pile of garbage like this. And as for the sound quality, I honestly can barely tell the difference between it and my 3rd gen.	2	March 11, 2021	0

I bought this one to start to try out the built-in 'smart home hub' functionality to see if it could replace some of the more complex home automation devices we have in our home.  So far, the answer is 'no'.  I started simple, testing with a couple of Zigbee lightbulbs I already had. The web page for the Gen4 echo says it supports both of the two bulbs I had (from different mfgs).  It will not discover either of them in a lamp only about 8' away from the Echo.  Both are discoverable from another hub device.  I very much like the idea of using an Echo device as my smart home hub -- but I don't hink this particular device is ready for prime time yet.	3	March 21, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Aside from the ugly circular shape and white power cord w/black model, it works and sounds great.  I wish Amazon would go back to the 2nd Generation style premium speaker.	3	January 11, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I traded in my original 1st generation Echo for this 4th generation unit because there were some very enticing trade in promotions.  I totally regret doing it.Looks:  the 4th generation looks much nicer than previous models, especially this Twilight Blue model.Sound: sound is good, but I keep this unit in the center of the my apartment, so front-firing speakers are not good.Performance:  This model's microphone array is not nearly as sensitive or performant as the 1st generation. I often have to raise my voice and repeat myself to get the Echo to do what I want it to do. . .or my 3rd Gen Echo Dot which is 2x the distance away from me will hear the command.  I rarely had to do this with the 1st generation model.  I really cannot wait until a next generation model comes out with decent microphone performance so I can trade this in.Update:  Customer Service or Technical Support saw this review and called me within a few hours of my post.  They suggested that I changed the wake word and then restart the Echo, but there was no improvement.  Kudos for paying attention, but this feels like a hardware/design flaw at the moment.	2	March 13, 2021	0
Echo 4th Gen	Sounds good when paired with another Gen 4 and a sub but it’s pretty flakey. Sometimes it hears you and sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes it understands you and sometimes it doesn’t. It does this thing when you tell it to stop playing music where it stops the music then plays a second of the music again then stops, kinda like when you old Ford Pinto diesels after you turn the engine off. I hope it’s just some software issues and not a physical design flaw. I invested in 4 of these plus 2 subs to cover music in the entire house.	3	July 31, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	Very hard to turn off notifications, one has to go though an entire list and turn them off in every category.	3	February 8, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	Alexa’s voice has a muffled quality to it and the unit is huge!  It can no longer be discrete but dominates the table top unnecessarily.	3	January 25, 2022	1
Echo 4th Gen	I have crappy 2nd and 3rd gen Dots. I can't stand how they sound on their own, so I use 3rd party speakers, which greatly improve the quality. The speaker base for the 2nd gen has been fritzing, so I thought why not spend more money for a single product that should work better and hopefully sound as good.Well, friends, it does not sound as good. I don't know if I have a bum unit — I don’t think I do — but Alexa's voice sounds awful. Podcasts are fine, and music is fine — not great, but fine, and so much better than her voice, which is why I don't think it's a bum unit. Alexa's voice is so muddy it's almost un-understandable. I'm returning it. I'll just get a new Bluetooth speaker to go with my old Dot.	3	January 18, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	All works good, but why send a black  device with a white power cord.ALL my other devices have black cords.I tried to return Echo ball but found out black cord not available.Would not order again.	3	December 13, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I really dislike this new shape. Alexa has more trouble hearing me, and I cannot see the blue bar at the bottom when I am just a little bit away. The taller shape made it easy to see the light (blue or otherwise) from anywhere in the room (no, there isn't a better place to put it) and I had far less trouble with Alexa hearing me. Short and round is not a good design for this. It affects the sound as well, as the speakers are lower. Putting my two new ones where I don't use them much, and putting my 3rd generation back where these are! Sound is good with this 4th generation, but I can't tell a significant difference between the two.	3	May 25, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"Amazon started sending notifications asking for reviews of products. I do not want to be bothered with this type of unsolicited notifications.Also, The voice recognition is pretty good but you have to speak very loudly for it to pick you up.EDIT: I got to hand it to amazon. They saw the negative review and called to help me sort out which notifications were on and how to turn them off. I had already turned the notification off but if they are going to push new notifications with an ""opt out"" approach at least they will help you turn them off.  changed from 1 start to 3 starts."	3	June 22, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	"My son warned me ""Don't buy an echo to listen to music. There's better devices by far.""I found if you want the latest top 20, it's great. But if you want to listen to classical like Yoyoma forget it."	3	December 1, 2021	1
Echo 4th Gen	I preferred the last generation. Speaker sounds more clear but the older version listened better.	3	March 6, 2022	1
