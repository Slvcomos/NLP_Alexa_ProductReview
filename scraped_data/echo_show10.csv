echo show 10	Very happy with it.	I really like it.	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 4, 2022	Amy Schwiderson	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFYZCH2M6PMNW4WWR4G77VWFGJ6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True
echo show 10	Worst device of century	Roomie got this 'thing' from a friend as a gift. Not sure why, long standing. As special bulbs had to be 'ordered' just to make it work. Well, that was the easy part.... talk about a huge waste of energy, and time. It doesn't respond half the time to voice commands. Which is more than beyond irritating. .. Don't blame it on poor wiring.  It's technology with too many bugs to bother with.  Be glad when I move out... and use real light switches again.	1.0 out of 5 stars	August 4, 2022	nettiegurl16	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHT2FXCCVPDKKIMQ6S7AVHQ4ZNSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	False

echo show 10	Overlooked Camera Design	Camera is off-center so the camera follow, which is a main feature, is always not actually facing you since the software also does not compensate for the offset camera. This could totally be fixed through an update, but they have yet to act on this. Echo devices occasionally activate in other rooms and then the echo device in the room I’m in ignores me. It would be great if you could adjust sensitivity of certain devices like you can with Google Nest speakers. Wish there was an actual AppStore for the echo devices with a display so you can use any recipe app, but you are limited to the very few available that have specific Echo skills available for them. Overall an OK device. The speaker sounds great, but lacking in other areas like screen follow and app options.	3.0 out of 5 stars	August 3, 2022	Brendan Riddle	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AER3236Q2IGJZOX5QEMAQSBJ7DJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True
echo show 10	Do NOT waste the money.	Paid up for this version hoping it would listen to me call her name compared to my Show 8 2nd. She doesn’t listen to anything. She’s 3 ft away from me. I have to yell for it to do things. Speakers are decent. I’d say not even close to worth full price. Also when you have an alarm set, in between or leading up the screen lights up the whole room 15 minutes before the alarm. Absolutely the most annoying feature. Doesn’t understand adaptive brightness either. She also doesn’t seem to comprehend what music you want to listen to, instead she pulls one word from what you said and plays whatever song exists with that phrase. 2/10 on this one. Fix the software.	3.0 out of 5 stars	August 3, 2022	Andrew Co	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQ6FYMXWIT6ENK2SQQ2S5UL6UVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True
echo show 10	Great gift for my work anniversary	This was a great gift for my work anniversary! It met all the expectations that I googled. Works great with all my home devices. Will be putting more around my house.	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 3, 2022	Latrisha Staton	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMCTE3GELVDX6UKGF4YY4YDKJAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True
echo show 10	Echo Show is a good upgrade	Replaced our old Echo with this one and so far it has been working well. I appreciate that it has the screen, which makes it more useful in the kitchen. But having the camera open with the screen turning to face you isn’t that helpful, and I miss the blue ring lighting up as an acknowledgment of hearing your voice (it lights up along the bottom of the screen, which can be hard to see). Overall this is a good upgrade from our old Echo and I do recommend it.	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 3, 2022	Mikko	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF3ZX4W2HBDUUAPDYQMVAAEVC33Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True
echo show 10	She’s smart	I love that she follows me around and when I’m at work I can put on camera and see that my husband is safe. ( He’s wheelchair bound)I wish camera would picture at night and 911 was free for emergencies.	5.0 out of 5 stars	August 3, 2022	Ramrod	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6ZEWPOXMFQO3Y3RHAHQDE7TXYQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True
