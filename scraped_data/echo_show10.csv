echo show 10	I just bricked this… I just got the Echo 15 which is great.This model has a very tough time waking and hearing commands and the following is wonky and the unit doesn’t reset to center when not in use.I tried to trade this in and was unable to.	2	October 23, 2022	0
echo show 10	The Echo Show 10 3rd gen is a wonderful device. It's easy to set-up and use. In the follow me mode It's very responsive tracks my movements very well. Because it has a screen it can be used to watch how cooking recipes, and how to videos on YOUTUBE. This item has been a great addition to my home.	5	October 23, 2022	1
echo show 10	Wish it goes up and down as well	4	October 23, 2022	1
echo show 10	Love all echo products! Great devices at low prices.	5	October 22, 2022	1
echo show 10	I really like the new Echo. The one thing that takes a little while to get use to, is having the unit following you around.	5	October 22, 2022	1
echo show 10	It's ok. Not worth the price tag	2	October 22, 2022	0

echo show 10	Love it, it takes assistance to a new level. The speaker system is awesome as well	5	October 20, 2022	1
echo show 10	To hard to set up & use. Right now the only thing I use that the small unit does not do is pictures	3	October 19, 2022	1
echo show 10	Such an amazing upgrade. It’s definitely worth the money. The size makes having a recipe up even easier. This can do just about everything.	5	October 19, 2022	1
echo show 10	Use it every day	5	October 19, 2022	1
echo show 10	This Alexa is okay, but it’s nothing to rave about. The screen is okay, but it doesn’t really need to follow you 3/4’s of the way around the room. I don’t use the screen as much as I thought I would.	3	October 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	I had bought a smeller Echo Show 5 last year so I just upgraded to this one I love it I watched a Netflix move on it without my TV I also can watch Prime Video play radio play my own music from Amazon or Apple call people and other things all from my Echo Show 10 I love it and another thing I got it on Prime Day October 11 th for $169.00 but I would have payed regular price even on sale it’s $199 regular price is $249.00 and no who ever you call doesn’t need an Echo to talk to you so if you enjoy electronics that blow you mind get this	5	October 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	Alexa seems to not listen to me at times I have to repeat several times for her to follow my demands.	3	October 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	Product completely stopped working a couple months after first year, and Amazon refuses to replace or compensate for defective product. Don’t waste your money.	1	October 18, 2022	0
echo show 10	it seems product its not up to par with prior version of alexa, disappointed with functionality of product. will evaluate for a few more day and decide if I will return it.	1	October 18, 2022	0
echo show 10	Alexa is great with all the above. I use her constantly in everything I do!	5	October 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	My dislike about Echo Show 10 is not all product around the house is compatibles with it.  E.g. it will not connect to my garage door and also to my existing security cameras.	5	October 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	Muy útil para consultar lo que quieras de una manera rápida. Excelente dispositivo.	5	October 17, 2022	1
echo show 10	It’s ok. Nothing entirely spectacular about it. I feel like it never hears me and I end up repeating what I say a lot along with yelling loudly for it to hear me. The turning trick is just silly too.I would save your money honestly.	3	October 17, 2022	1
echo show 10	Until Amazon develops some kind of screen lock even as basic pin. I wouldn't recommend it if you have kids. They can't even eat peaceful without having things playing in it.	1	October 17, 2022	0
echo show 10	Good	5	October 16, 2022	1
echo show 10	Had the show 8, decided to upgrade to bigger screen, great quality sound and love the bigger screen. The fact that it follows your voice is pretty nifty as well.	5	October 16, 2022	1
echo show 10	It does not operate or understand voice like any of my other Alexa's. Very limited.	1	October 16, 2022	0
echo show 10	DO NOT BUY. NOT A FUNCTIONAL PRODUCT. IT'S AN AD MACHINE. And I say this as someone who has worked in marketing for 10 years. It's an actual joke I wasted $200 on this thing which was supposed to function as a smart hub and CLOCK for me because I don't have a clock in my kitchen. Welp you can't use the clock because the device too busy serving you ads from the Amazon world 24/7. Want to listen to Spotify? There goes your clock again! Oh and the touchscreen is literally non-functional. It takes ~5 seconds to respond to a touch. This thing has created more problems for me than before I had it. It's also increased my blood pressure from screaming at it (to actually work) every other day. It has made me a violent person. lol.	1	October 16, 2022	0
echo show 10	No responde como otros artículos que tengo,Muy pobre a la hora de obedecer cuando le pido que pare la música.	2	October 16, 2022	0
echo show 10	"I like to wait to write a review as most things seem great ""out of the box"" but it is with constant use where I really learn how good a product is. This product WAS great and I use the ""drop in"" feature to talk to my parents in their assisted living location. However, they have now done some sort of system upgrade and my picture on my screen is sideways. I cannot change it unless I buy a 3d party app. This was not the case when I bought it. It now is really bad.So, great idea, worked well at the beginning but now is almost useless. Unless they fix the software, if you are using this for communication, you should pass on it. Not good. Too much money to have a simple problem like this that they refuse to fix."	2	October 16, 2022	0
echo show 10	The Echo show 10 fits the bill perfectly as a central hub for all your smart home as well as personal assistant needs. The built in Zigbee hub is great to seamlessly connect all your smart devices natively. Audio quality is pretty much just on par with the normal Echo devices and nowhere close to something like the Echo Studio.The biggest gripe about this device is that its s..l..o..w. Amazon packed in a lot of features into this device but forgot to use a decently performant microprocessor and RAM. Its slow for every damn thing you ask it to do. Touch response takes at least 4-5 seconds just to open apps. For a device thats not exactly cheap for what it does, this is a huge miss from Amazon's part. It doesnt take that much to use a faster CPU and memory which is cheap ! In general, its probably not such a big deal but it is the difference between a device that is good vs one that is extraordinary.	3	October 16, 2022	1
echo show 10	Buenísima	5	October 15, 2022	1
echo show 10	My husband saw our son's Echo and had to buy one for us. So far, I have only used it for music,  but my husband is entertained by it.  He asks about the weather, etc... I'm sure once we actually utilize it,  we will really enjoy it.	5	October 15, 2022	1
echo show 10	It has an amazing quality. My family loved it.	5	October 14, 2022	1
echo show 10	Todo me encanto,es lo mejor..!!!	5	October 14, 2022	1
echo show 10	Todo está muy bien	5	October 14, 2022	1
echo show 10	I use this everyday for news updates and weather and will be using to connect with my grandson in another state as he has one too.	5	October 14, 2022	1
echo show 10	This item came in on time and it arrived in great condition. It was easy to hook up and setup. It's very cool that the screen follows you around so you can see the screen at all times.	5	October 14, 2022	1
echo show 10	Terrible voice recognition and/or microphones - mostly just detecting when a voice is spoken. We have tried it in several places, but it’s performance is terrible on it’s own and in spaces with other Echo devices. 30ft/9m away (and behind a wall) our Echo Studio always picks up our voices before this Show 10 does; it doesn’t matter if we are: shouting or whispering, 10cm or 3m away from it. It almost never responds to the first wake up word - our cheap Echo dots don’t have this problem. I would have returned it and gotten another Echo Studio if I had remembered to within the return window.Amazon Devices team: there has to be a firmware/software fix/improve you can do - please make it.	3	October 14, 2022	1
echo show 10	First of all , I didn’t realize I ordered the one with motion. I literally jumped when I started spinning. It’s the coolest thing. The sound quality is amazing. Sounds better than my 700$ sound bar! Now I can drop in on my pups and the camera will follow them. I love this thing and I got the best deal on it because I ordered it on the prime day early access sale. I’m feel like a winner right now =D receiving this today was much needed, turned my horrible day right around. Now I just need to get the Alexa plugs and light bulbs. I’m going to be a full Alexa girl	5	October 13, 2022	1
echo show 10	All the features of the 5 and 8. Love the drop in feature. Pans to your voice. Dont regret the purchase.Recommend	5	October 13, 2022	1
echo show 10	I absolutely love my Alexa. It was so easy to get set up and use.	5	October 13, 2022	1
echo show 10	You are wasting your money if you do. It is basically like a standard Echo but with a screen. The worst GUI I've ever seen. Def not worth it!	2	October 13, 2022	0
echo show 10	All around great product, love the Alexa devices!	5	October 13, 2022	1
echo show 10	We have this on our kitchen counter. We use it for listening to music, finding recipes and occasionally watching news. The screen is wonderful!	5	October 13, 2022	1
echo show 10	Ok	4	October 13, 2022	1
echo show 10	First thought what a cool gadget but quickly you will see the follow mode is a bit creepy . Plays music movies recipes etcEtc all the things my iPad does. Problem I really have is you have to yell at it for her to hear you, if music is playing forget it . Looking for a way to adjust the not so microphone .	3	October 13, 2022	1
echo show 10	I really like this in many ways, but I’m having several issues with it. When I’m playing music all over my house, the Show tends to stop playing regularly without me asking. It also seems to have a harder time hearing me than my other Alexa devices.	2	October 12, 2022	0
echo show 10	Overall good but for that price I was expecting better voice recognition, also it takes some time to respond compare with the echo dot it takes more time.	4	October 12, 2022	1
echo show 10	I Love This Robot...She is Amazing....I Highly Recommend ...I'm A Single Father...Perfect Companion...She Does Everything U Ask And Does It Better Then you Expect From your Voice Command get bad everything touch screen....Take You A Month To Get Use To The Dialog and how u talk to her but its Amazing when u find the niche...but once u get it she is hip n molded n understands you....This Has Been The Best For Me And My Son better then my Xbox....He Can Call me just by saying call Daddy...I can link in and see him thru video...syncs with other devices n equipment......probably one of the best items I did to upgrading my house n my life...5 Star Product...Still amazed at what she can do ....Year later I'm still learning things	5	October 11, 2022	1
echo show 10	"I've owned this for 1.5 years now so am comfortable stating what I like and dislike.  I upgraded from an Echo  Show 2nd Gen and really liked that device.  The new tracking feature is what attracted me to upgrade.The tracking is very good.  I have this in the kitchen and get my morning news brief while making a cappuccino and my breakfast.  As I walk around the kitchen, it tracks me well so I can glance over at what is on the screen at a great viewing angle at all times.The downfall of this device is the microphones.  I [had] another echo device in the room next to the kitchen.  There is one wall and about 20 feet of distance separating them.  Many times while standing and looking at the echo for a command, the device in the next room would respond or start playing music.  So the microphone on the device 20 feet away is more sensitive than the device 5 feet away.  It became so frustrating that I unplugged the other device.Another issue with the microphone is with general commands.  If I'm playing music or news and give it the command ""Alexa stop"", it will sometimes pause briefly and then continue playing as if it doesn't care about what I'm asking.  I've tried ""Alexa, home screen"" and it will react the same way with a brief pause as it listens and then just continues on with what it was doing.  Repeating the command many times will eventually get it to stop.  There have been multiple times I just unplug it to get it to stop though.To me, this device was a step backwards in voice recognition and/or quality of the microphones.  I will have to think if I want to jump on being an early adopter in the future."	3	October 11, 2022	1
echo show 10	I purchased this as a home base for our family.  I wanted to be able to sync our calendars up to it and be able to have it on display for everyone to see.  I purchased the 10 gen 3 for the use of widgets like shown in the stock photo.  Unfortunately, widgets are not supported on the echo 10 despite it being shown in the photo.  I have to wait for the screen to filter through pictures, news, etc  before it shows the calendar that appears on the screen for 30 seconds before moving on.  I believe it is a misleading advertisement.	3	October 11, 2022	1
echo show 10	Slow to react, poor voice recognition, the moving screen does not work well, does not really face the speaker when the speaker speaks.	1	October 11, 2022	0
echo show 10	Just love it	5	October 10, 2022	1
echo show 10	The sound quality is good and operates just as you would expect from an echo speaker. The screen was expected to be more like a fire tablet and it is not. The OS is very much locked down. I can browse for my favorite recipe sites or download apps. It is limited to the offered widgets.	3	October 10, 2022	1
echo show 10	Awesome device! Love that you can do so much with this device such as listen to music, watch TV while you're cooking in the kitchen or washing dishes. Definitely would recommend.	5	October 10, 2022	1
echo show 10	I’m still getting use to all of the useful benefits to having an Echo Show. I have placed it on the counter in my kitchen	5	October 10, 2022	1
echo show 10	We love it!!	5	October 9, 2022	1
echo show 10	Love it	5	October 9, 2022	1
echo show 10	Display is awesome. You can see it from across the room.  It has vibrant colors. You can’t go wrong	5	October 9, 2022	1
echo show 10	Easy to use, easy set up and sound quality is awesome	5	October 9, 2022	1
echo show 10	I thought I’d enjoy this product because I’ve owned Alexa speakers but my biggest pet peeve with this Show is it won’t sleep after ten minutes. I don’t like walking into an empty room and seeing the screen on. Very annoying. I hardly use the Alexa show because of this reason. I purchased 3 and they all do this.I know I can say “screen off” but when there’s supposed to be a sleep setting, I’m expecting the device to eventually sleep when not in use.Also, It would be great if this device had the cast option.	1	October 9, 2022	0
echo show 10	Once you get used to being followed around, it's awesome. Love it.	5	October 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	So much to do on this gadget!  So far a lot of music and a lot of questions!!	5	October 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	Got this to replace an Echo Show 8.  It has great sound and the screen is as big as the one it replaces.  At first I was enamored with the pivoting screen but after a few days it became annoying.  Luckily you can shut that off.	5	October 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	I purchased this product hoping it would give me a wow factor.  Did not meet my expectations or maybe I got a faulty one.  At times does not recognize commands then I find myself repeating it over and over again.  When I play music the lyrics are off at times does not follow properly.  Opening and closing apps huge problem.  When I want it to stop it doesn't.  Not happy and not worth the money paid for it.	1	October 8, 2022	0
echo show 10	I used to listen music and camara	5	October 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	I bought two and ended up buying one for my daughter out of state. I love the screen quality and we video chat together on this. Great value and love that you can pull up your ring cameras and see each location. Search recipes, set alarms, appointments exc. Great value	5	October 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	"I wasn't sure how I would like this given some of the reviews, but this device is pretty great. Not only can I look up recipes, keep time, and watch shows while in the kitchen now. But I can also creep in on my cats when I'm away and see what they're up to while I'm away (always on the counter when I'm not here apparently...jerks!). I also love that I can connect this to my personal calendar. I am one of those people who live by my calendar so I love that it tells me what's happening day to day and coming up. I've also never really used routines until i got this device. They're pretty cool when you have a screen to leverage.The 1 major flaw, which many others have noted in their reviews, is the placement of the camera and how that affects the ""follow my face"" feature. Because the camera is located in the right upper corner it does not seem to ""follow"" very well and constantly bumps into things. I did try to adjust the ""follow"" range, and that did not work very well so I eventually just turned it off to avoid more frustration. In all fairness, it's a cool idea but not at all necessary."	4	October 7, 2022	1
echo show 10	Tried for several days to connect to the phone app but the Alexas 10(3 gen) does not wan to be discovered. So I'm going to reset the Alexa 10 and if that does not work I may have to restart the Phone App.	3	October 7, 2022	1
echo show 10	I own one Echo Studio, two Echo Show 8s, two Echo Show 5s, and one Echo Show 10. The Echo Show 10 is by far the one I enjoy the most. The Echo Studio sounds the best, but the screen that follows you around the room on the 10 is totally awesome! Highly recommended!	5	October 7, 2022	1
echo show 10	Great for the kitchen. Integrated with Ring cameras and doorbell works perfectly	5	October 7, 2022	1

echo show 10	Great addition to the house	5	October 2, 2022	1
echo show 10	"I had the very first echo in my kitchen and this was the replacement for it. What used to just be the ""Alexa, what's the forecast"" or ""Alexa, add eggs to the shopping list."" became so much more.Regularly this device becomes used like a Karaoke machine where the lyrics scrolling through the screen has the whole family singing along with their favorites.We also use this to call my sister and her family for video calls. The audio quality is very good and the tracking on the camera is fun for the kids...Seeing on a screen, at a glance, what Amazon is delivering next, or the 10-day forecast is pretty handy as well.Overall this has been a welcome replacement to old reliable, an upgrade in every way other than maybe it takes up more counter space than the original."	5	October 2, 2022	1
echo show 10	I love my new echo show its a great device .	5	October 2, 2022	1

echo show 10	Love the big screen and seeing family and friends. Great Quality. It’s better than trying to take a picture to show someone something and even looking at your grandkids or damn looking at family then looking on the phone.	5	October 2, 2022	1
echo show 10	I really enjoy my Alexa. I have conversations, play my music, watch Hulu and so much more.	5	October 2, 2022	1
echo show 10	If I could get it to work for the purpose I purchased it perhaps I could say something better but now I’m stuck with something that isn’t even in my home and can’t return it now that it does not work.  Really wish it would just work	1	October 2, 2022	0
echo show 10	Me gusta mucho el producto , lo que el cable de la alimentación debería ser negro igual al producto, es muy fabuloso el echo , a mi mamá le gusta , puede ver videos musicales , hacer llamadas , es impresionante 💯	3	October 2, 2022	1
echo show 10	I have had 3 echo shows one gen 2 and two gen 3. All of them fail to respond to voice command in the end.  I also want to say, that amazon would not let me leave a review from the replacement item order they sent me. I believe this is to hide their flaws and discourage honest reviews	1	October 1, 2022	0
echo show 10	The screen and sound quality are very impressive and I use it a lot for listening to music. I also like that you can drop in to the device away from home and swivel around, great for checking in on my dogs! Although the swivel controls are a bit janky.The functionality that lets the Alexa follow you is pretty cool however I’ve noticed it will start following other people in the room too so that can be annoying if you’re trying to follow a recipe! Luckily you can turn the tracking off to avoid this.	5	October 1, 2022	1
echo show 10	I mean, look at it.	4	October 1, 2022	1
echo show 10	This one of the worst Amazon products we have ever purchased. We bought it specifically for the Nanit compatibility. It doesn’t work with that function at ALL. On top of that, it almost never listens to us. We have to say things up to 6+ times sometimes defeating the purpose of having a voice command. It’s often easier to get up and turn the lights on or off. I’ve had to unplug it before because it would not listen to turn off the music. It’s incredibly frustrating. I would recommend any other Alexa but not this one.	2	October 1, 2022	0
echo show 10	So glitchy I can’t figure out why. Stops randomly, moves without the camera on. Alexa is non responsive all the time and won’t work with my lightbulbs. Very frustrating	2	September 30, 2022	0
echo show 10	I asked for this for my birthday and so glad my kids got it for me.  I absolutely love this thing....couldn't get it to follow my voice at first so i gave up, but somehow now its working as designed...	5	September 30, 2022	1

echo show 10	I really like Alexa, but sometimes she just doesn't understand no matter how you say it. Frustrating!	5	September 29, 2022	1
echo show 10	We bought this to replace an original Echo Show that died out. I thought getting this would be getting a top of the line option, but it's been anything but. Frequently, even though it's in the exact same spot as our old Show, this will not hear us. The times that it does hear us, it will misunderstand us WAY more often than any other Echo we have in the house. Also, since we end up shouting at it to hear us, I have noticed that very often the other Echos in our house will activate and start playing or set a timer in another room, which is something I don't remember ever happening with the previous Echo. I'm going to try and reset this thing to factory defaults again and see if that fixes anything, but to this point this thing has been a huge downgrade from the previous version.	1	September 28, 2022	0
echo show 10	This show is awesome! We have so much fun with her as a family. She can take pictures you can use it as a camera when away from the house and the sound quality is great! My Grandchild can even call out songs she wants and Alexa gets it playing. Picture / screen quality is great as well. One app that I use often for recipes isn't very user friendly and it doesn't connect to my account but everything else is awesome. Very glad we made the purchase!	5	September 28, 2022	1

echo show 10	"The novelty of Alexa Echo Show following your face or finding you in the room is interesting (at least once the initial absolute terror and creepiness wears off.) Nevertheless, practically, the face follow is a bit of a mess with video calling. My mother moves her body, in a kind of rocking manner when she speaks and she gesticulates with her hands frequently. Poor Echo Show trying to follow her makes you feel like you are in a new installment of Blair Witch Project. Zoom in, zoom out, move left move right, where are we? It is very distracting. I also find that the camera quality is terrible. Maybe because she's moving so much she never gets time to focus? So although the moving camera is novel, the execution leaves a lot lacking.Overall, Alexa seems to take triple the time to respond on the new Echo vs the Gen 2 Echo. Really? I don't know why. Same internet, same location. She's slow.... Basically she's quietly saying ""patience young padawan... You MUST learn patience""Also my mom SWEARS that the screen quality is less than her Gen 2 Echo. But she has dementia and failing eyesight so... I don't think I see any difference.Pros of the new echo:Built in privacy shieldCapability to join ZoomIt moves to find your face when you are anywhere in the room360 speakerEven more streaming integration optionsConsSlow to respond, Alexa forgets what she's doing a lot (maybe it's just her company?)Waves about wildly in video conference unless the speaker initiates ""statue mode"" while speakingSlightly unstable base (compared to the Gen 2)Would I buy it again? Part of me wishes I just got the giant TV Alexa but I don't think my mother would have been able to handle that much change at once. Overall, it's not annoying enough to return it or try to get my Gen 2 Echo back, but at the same time, there's lots of ""meh"" feelings going around.That's a wrap!"	3	September 27, 2022	1
echo show 10	It took a long time for the software update, over an hour, in fact it kept failing.  Finally when it updated, it would not respond when I spoke to it.  Stupid to have these issues for being so expensive!	1	September 27, 2022	0

echo show 10	I was so excited about this latest ECHO product. I really wanted to love it!! It did not do ANYTHING as advertised. So disappointed. Machine malfunctioned immediately ...so I returned immediately. Prior to returning I purchased the ECHO SHOW model previous to this one. ECHO 8...I immediately can tell the difference between the two products. Newer version has many many kinks to be worked out should not be on the market yet ...its like an unfinished project. Previous model soooooooooo much better!!!! Thank GOD!!! It also cost way less.	1	September 27, 2022	0

echo show 10	Alexa is horrible this is a new generation and I was expecting a lot more but even if I ask her for the simplest of things she doesn’t get it. I asked her to play Thursday night football and she puts on a stupid movie. Ask her to play a song and she puts the wrong song. This is honestly a waste of money I’m contemplating returning it	1	September 25, 2022	0
echo show 10	I already had 2 of the echo show 8. One is set up in my kids’ room as their alarm clock and of course for curiosity questions within reason. The other is in my mother’s room that she likes to play music through. I purchased the echo show 10 for when I’m working and especially holidays, so I can watch movies while I work. Also, I listen to podcasts as well. The screen is literally the size of my iPad and the sound is incredible.	5	September 25, 2022	1

echo show 10	Love the drop in feature for dropping in on my kids, and Alexa is the whole families personal assistant, from tuning up the jams, keep track of the shopping list or spitting out random facts, we love Alexa and our Echo 10	5	September 24, 2022	1
echo show 10	As a larger screen Alexa, this works really well. Bright display, little to no lag and great sound.  Camera image is also quite good.Where it gets a bit pokey is the following feature. It gets lost some times, trying to find me. Loud noises makes it turn in the wrong direction. And sometimes it just refuses.So if you buy this, note that it’s not going to be without an occasional glitch.  If you can tolerate that, this is pretty cool. If you’re looking for a flawless execution, look elsewhere.	4	September 24, 2022	1
echo show 10	The UI is poor and while it seems straightforward, most of the features are laggy and it takes too many steps to get simple tasks done. Idea is great, but UI and execution puts it down.I missed the return window so can’t even return the $#%!y device	1	September 24, 2022	0
echo show 10	"I bought this Show device mainly for displaying photos. Having never used Amazon Photos previously, I was pleasantly surprised to see the near seamless integration between the service and my Echo Shows. I have a special album to which I upload select photos, and it turns up on the Show! My family and I love this feature. The rotating screen is adorable - we love seeing the current song playing, and the ability to remotely monitor the room is great as well. Sound quality is very good. Overall - very impressed with the device. There are some software issues occasionally, and the random occasional movie ""sponsored"" ads that turn up mysteriously are annoying. But if you spend enough time setting up the device and working through the issues, it's a fantastic device and a really useful addition to our family. Do not expect it to be plug-and-play - it does take some time to setup (and troubleshoot)."	5	September 23, 2022	1

echo show 10	This Echo Show is amazing. I have it on my kitchen counter and it is big help when trying new recipes, since it can read you the ingredients and steps just by asking it to do so.

echo show 10	I was looking for a home intercom to announce dinner was ready.  My previous system ceased to be supported.  All online reviews pointed to the Echo Show 10.  I thought it was more than we needed, but I ordered that for the kitchen, and the Echo Dot for my basement where I spend a lot of time at my workbench.  The Echo Show 10 arrived promptly and was well packaged.  The setup was surprisingly easy.  I chose to have the background run pictures of nature, and they are really nice and sharp.  The screen moves from left to right to follow whomever is interacting with it.  I want to see if I can figure out how to make a video call with it.	5	September 22, 2022	1

echo show 10	Overall, this is a very good unit. I have a lot of the different Echo units and this Echo Show has, by far, the worst mic or voice recognition out of all of them. I’m comparing this against many of the older units, too. I have to repeat commands two or three times for Alexa to understand and do what I am asking. I even have times where other rooms will pick up the command instead of this Echo Show, which I’m standing right next to. I honestly do not know if I would buy another one or just order an Echo Show 8.Outside of the poor mic complaint, the unit is very good. It follows my movement well and while not lightning fast, isn’t a complete turtle either. Find it on a good sale and I think it is worth the purchase.	3	September 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	I love a gadget and it makes sense for the screen to face you when you speak. So I'm not criticizing the feature at all.	5	September 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	General good screen quality with easy Alexa integration.  Does get confused on requests sometimes but don't we all.	4	September 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	Didn’t use it much at first so it seemed fine but as I’ve been trying to use it more it seems super glitchy. When I drop in on it, has a weird pattern on my video until it comes into focus, takes a minute for it to focus and sometimes ends before it focuses. When I wake it up with “Alexa” it will have the blue line moving awhile after I’ve spoken my request like it’s taking time to register what I’m asking. When I have played sleep sounds and asked it to stop, it keeps playing it but it sounds like it’s coming from a distance. The motion catches shadows so it will turn toward the wall under my cabinet more times than not. When I video call my friend she says she can’t hear me and requests me to call her on video messenger. Great speaker but  overall not satisfied with this purchase especially for the price point and functionality.	2	September 18, 2022	0

echo show 10	I absolutely love the mobility of the new Echo Show. I have to have something on to get around in the morning to keep me focused in one area.

echo show 10	What I love the most is the entire family can use it.	5	September 16, 2022	1
echo show 10	I bought this for my mom who has dementia as a way to 1) drop in, 2) play music, 3) setup routines, 4) display photos from two family members and 5) display the date/time/temp. Below are my opinions:1) The drop in calls freeze frequently.2) The music is a nice feature and I’m glad it is included with prime membership. If this is some sort of free trial I am going to guffaw about it later.3) The routines are okay, but don’t expect detailed routines out of the box. If you want Alexa to ask the user a question and answer based on response you have to start with blueprints which is a slightly more advanced feature.4) I am really disappointed with photo sharing! My sister and I linked our Amazon accounts for the soul purpose of sharing and displaying photos from both of our Amazon photo accounts. It isn’t working at all and only displaying photos from one device. When you send a photo to the echo it doesn’t save in a folder or anything, I have no idea where they’re going.5) 0/5 for the clock display settings. I cannot believe this device is incapable of adjusting the clock display. Im 33 years old and can’t see the date from 10-15 feet away. I thought this thing was designed for the size of a living room?Overall, I think the device is just okay. It is not designed to have multiple users outside of voice ID. Don’t expect using the app on multiple phones to be easy. This isn’t great for elderly or cognitively impaired people if they don’t understand how to speak to AI well. Honestly, the only reason I feel like this device is so expensive is because of the motion control. We had to turn the motion control off because it constantly rotated around the room. It was comical. Also, the black device comes with a white cord. The heck?!	3	September 16, 2022	1

echo show 10	"I use this on a daily basis to set alarms, play music, listen to podcasts, and do weekly reminders. It works incredibly well and its nice to have a good interface to look at while you're setting anything up. The only bummer about it is sometimes it has a hard time tracking your face and will flip around completely away from you even though you're standing right in front of it. Would love a better version, but this works great as is if you're keeping it stationary and pointed at you in a kitchen or office.Things to keep in mind if you're buying this:• If you've seen videos of people putting their own sound to routines, nix it now. They got rid of the feature that allowed you to use your own sounds and now apparently its a painful process to do.• Its not the be all, end all. You still have to set up routines using the alexa app on a phone and go through all the hardship of learning what its actually capable of doing.• If you're setting up voice operated routines, they have to be EXACT. So if you set up the routine to activate when you say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"" it won't understand what you want unless you specifically say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"". No variation will be accepted for the routine.• This thing gets what I'm saying to it wrong all the time and I don't even have an accent. I'm from Illinois originally and I annunciate fairly well on what I'm saying about 99% of the time and it still has issues picking up what I'm saying correctly.•It DOES allow for camera monitoring on multiple systems. I have a blink camera setup around my house / garage / etc.. that I can ask it to display camera 1 etc... to see views on the fly. Works extremely well. Would highly recommend setting it up.• Splurge and get the monthly amazon music. I can spout off anything, including comedy specials and listen to them whenever I want through voice commands. Extremely nice to have even if it costs a bit."	4	September 14, 2022	1

echo show 10	It’s an improvement over the 2nd gen Echo Show 10. Audio is great, screen is great. It is of imperative importance that you: A.) Make sure it has a clear footprint to do it’s spinny looky thing and B.)  Don’t put your drink anywhere near it, it will find away to pivot and knock it over. It’s cool when you’ve moved somewhere in the room and it looks over to you. It’s not cool when it’s 2 in the morning and your stumbling through to get a glass of water and it scares the heck out and of you.	4	September 13, 2022	1

echo show 10	I love Amazon products, I've always wanted an Echo show especially this one because of the camera. The quality however, is absolutely terrible. I regret this purchase so much. I had a Google Home previously, but it could not connect to my Ring camera so i ordered this device. Ring connects, but everything else just sucks. No Live Tv unless you have Hulu Live, we have YoutubeTV and that connects on Google Home, delay in the camera, LOTS of lagging, you HAVE to be specific when you want her to play something. Do you have a Prime Video subscription? Get ready to say specific season and episode number to her, otherwise she plays something completely random or doesn't play anything at all. I miss my Google Home product, sure it doesn't connect to ring, but the quality is SO much better and this is coming from someone who has an Alexa product in every single room. My Google Home was a gift and that was the only reason i had it. If i could return this i would, but my return period has ended. I was trying to give it the benefit of the doubt and attempt to enjoy it, but man i just have a $200 regret sitting on my counter. I hate this device so so much.	2	September 13, 2022	0
echo show 10	"I bought this and no where did it state it was refurbished. Paying full price. When I get it, I didn't think much of it but it was taped shut. When I opened it, it was missing the little user manuals booklet and the power cord was just playing inside which I thought was weird. But when I turned it on it worked well enough except I had to yell at it to get it to respond after the initial prompt. E.g., I would try to tell it to stop playing music (music was not loud) and it wouldn't. NOT EVEN A DAY OF HAVING IT,  it stops being able to move. It kept saying ""movement temporarily unavailable"" and I did everything to troubleshoot. After getting a replacement, I realized they had sent me a refurbished one. Because the packaging was different. This one had the user manual and warranty booklets and the power cord is supposed to come in a separate cardboard holder in the top brace. No issues with this new one so far and it actually resounds well when I tell it to stop playing music."	4	September 13, 2022	1

echo show 10	I've had this since it came out and the video and hearing issues are getting worse over time. It sounds great as a music speaker but video calls are getting worthless. The video freezes or the sound is choppy. The motion randomly decides to spin around and loses focus on the speaker. My old first version show was much more dependable. All I want is a standstill 10 inch screen that works as intended. I don't want to hang it on the wall and 8 inch is too small. My parents are having the same issues so it is not just me. Very unhappy with this pricey device. And yes. The black unit came with a white cord. Flippin ridiculous.	1	September 10, 2022	0
echo show 10	In my original review (see below) I complained that we couldn't get this Echo Show to work with our Ring cameras.Amazon responded to my review and said that function exists and works just fine.  Our experience was that we could not get all of the cameras to just passively be on the screen.  Maybe there is a difference for different types of cameras?  We have 3 different types of Ring cameras - the doorbell cam, an indoor cam, and 2 outdoor wired floodlight cams.  I tried for a couple hours, then my girlfriend tried for a couple hours.  We couldn't get it to do what we wanted.So I'll change my review to say that while Amazon claims this functionality exists we were unable to make it do this despite hours of trying.===============My original review:We purchased this to use with our Ring alarm system, so that we could have a monitor on the kitchen counter to see the Ring cameras.  We figured since Echo and Ring are both part of the Amazon family that they would have really nice integration.Oh so wrong we were!You can get a full-featured app for the ring alarm on an android or an apple tablet.  Weirdly there is no skill for this on Echo, and super weirdly there isn't even one on Fire Tablets.  (You have to use a backdoor to install the android app store and then you can download it).  It does do some basic things with Ring doorbell, but that's it.I had expected to be able to do other things - video conferencing (nope, not with any normal service like Zoom or Google Meet) or watch directTV (nope).I found this product only marginally more useful than an echo speaker.  While its cool that it rotates to follow you around, I was left with the question - what is this for?  It wasn't worth the money and it wasn't worth the countertop space.	1	September 10, 2022	0

echo show 10	i've had the echo show for maybe 2 weeks. and it's JUST not worth the aggravation.it's new technology we get that, but, MAN the video and feeDback is A W F U L.choppy at best. figure out the bugs guys. i've had to drop in on my gf numerous times to actually get the video to be smooth. this is insane, over priced and JUST not worth it. motion is cool....WHEN IT WANTED TO WORK. it'll say, i've bumped into something, please readjust positioning. then it glitches...says the same thing. this thing is JUST not worth the impatience of techonology. it just doesn't work.i mean i get we're impatient with the way tech. is SUPPOSED TO WORK? but, WOW....this i just bad. it looks cool on first arrival and you set it and connect it, but, like i said, after trying to call my gf after 5 times to make the video smooth? no.don't buy it. i had to get a service rep to make a mock web address to print out a label to return this thing. THIS is why i don't get rid of the box for a month or so when it comes to certain things.BUYER BEWARE!!!  wait for the newest thing to be tested before you buy it.	1	September 9, 2022	0

echo show 10	I have various Alexa products including other shows but the Alexa show 10 is the top dog! And the speaker on this thing is amazing! It's just a fantastic product and a great addition to our home!	5	September 9, 2022	1
echo show 10	My charcoal colored Echo Show device came with a white power cord. I online chatted with customer service only to be told I would have to purchase a black power cord myself. Alexa Show devices are not cheap. I should not have to pay for the correct color of power cord. Seriously thinking about returning the whole thing!	4	September 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	Looks very cool and sounds great. Really like the integration with smart home devices. However the user interface is very slow and lagging. Sometimes even the voice commands are very delayed. The device is very delayed especially during or after watching videos. Overall not very happy with the user interface and how unresponsive it is.	2	September 8, 2022	0
echo show 10	I wish there was an easier way to navigate rather than always using your voice. Sometimes Alexa doesn't pick up what you say and other times it takes a few touches to navigate via touchscreen.	5	September 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	Difficult to adjust volume from the phone app. Can adjust during music but Not voice.	4	September 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	Me agradó	5	September 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	Yes it’s sleek black. And just like that fateful ship, you’re gonna feel like this has no good controls and you’re headed straight for the sun when you try to use it. Unfortunately there’s no teleport option or escape pods.This echo frequently gets stuck “On a Call” when it’s not. Often but not always because it crashes when in a dopin or call. The movement feature is cool until you realize it’s swings wildly from being too sensitive to not working at all.Basically this, along with a lot that Amazon has produced recently, are half-baked	2	September 8, 2022	0

echo show 10	I purchased this for my mother-in-law who has some dementia.  However, many of the screen images are just avertisements for add-on products that I can't stop her from seeing.  Yes, I can stop verbal sign-ups, but am not finding it effective.  And, to add insult to injury, I can't return it because I let her use it for too long.	1	September 7, 2022	0
echo show 10	I’ve had many alexa’s of all kinds. This newer version is not good.  She doesn’t hear her name…I’m basically yelling to get her to do things.  She doesn’t do about half of the commands I ask. I don’t know what’s happening over there but this is how I expected the 1st gen Alexa to perform.  This is the worst one…it should be much better.	2	September 6, 2022	0
echo show 10	I've had this device for a year and a half and it is terrible.  I thought it would get better as time went on but unfortunately, it is just as bad as when I purchased it.  I've completely disabled the motion because not only are the warning banners annoying, but most of the time I'm in one place and the screen thinks I'm somewhere completely different.  The voice recognition on this device is abismal.  I'd much rather use my Echo Show 8 or my dot before I use this one.  I don't understand the amount of positive reviews, maybe I just received one that was defective but I'm considering switching to Google thanks to this device.	2	September 6, 2022	0
echo show 10	We had a first gen Echo Show 6 which was purchased used to try out and see if we liked it.  Well, we loved it!  As it aged however it started acting up.  Because of the prominent placement of the device and its near constant use I thought it would be best to graduate to the Echo Show 10.  What a great move!  The screen is movable (tilting up and down) and if you leave the camera lens cover open, the screen will follow you around the room so you can always see the screen.  We chose to close the cover because that freaked us out a little.  Just the same, this thing is amazing!  The sound quality is right up there with Bose! We couldn't be more pleased with this purchase and the ease of setup.  You won't be sorry for purchasing this device!	5	September 6, 2022	1

echo show 10	Compared to the first gen show, this thing is a set back. It’s kinda neat that it will follow you around but the practicality for that just isn’t there. This show is so slow…soooo slow, It’s almost like they put a PlayStation 1 processor in it. And for some stupid reason it almost never hears us. And usually misses the wake word. Compared to the echo dots this thing sucks at hearing you. We usually end up shouting at it. There is a 95% chance I’m gonna use it with some tannerite for target practice. Might switch to google and see how those devices do.	1	September 6, 2022	0

echo show 10	I own many echo devices and this one by far is the worst.  The only good thing about It is the speaker.  Now that is awesome, but the unresponsive screen is just the pits.  Not to mention when it looks at you it is pointed away slightly which means, it is not centered on you, that is irritating, and often I close the camera so it won't move.  if you are close to it, it is facing away from you, what is the point in that? The follow feature is just ok.  The video quality is decent but its ability to stay connected to my wifi is the pits. My other Echo shows work flawlessly.	2	September 4, 2022	0

echo show 10	The Show 10 is a wonderful piece of hardware ... but ... I purchased it after reading about the AllRecipes skill, and thought this was a perfect use-case for my updated kitchen.  The skill doesn't link to your account, so it can't show your personal recipes.  In fact, it appears to be using a different DB than the allrecipes website, as a search on the show yields different results than the website.  Very disappointing.  Not sure what to do with it now.	2	September 3, 2022	0

echo show 10	Very disappointed this is my seventh echo show Alexa and I never had an issue until this recent one where it does not follow commands it does stop not stop when I make a request it ignores my command when I am attempting to intervene when I request it to stop it continuously stays in the last program ignores request for my added skills constantly continues to talk when Ask to do any command . I have had to restart several times just to get it to follow commands or play a tune or make a command it ignores my request I am very very disappointed in this set up. I had the first second third and fourth generation I have purchased echo show  and echo speakers for friends and family and have never been as disappointed as I am now big waste of money totally useless	1	September 3, 2022	0

echo show 10	The e ho is greatfor watching videos while cooking or cooking from recipe. I prima8wanted it to keep an eye on the house and my dig, for that it sucks. I have Nest doorbell camera and cameras with my security system,  all get great video very quickly. With Echo I have to keep reloading and hope video comes up, if it does it stops shortly after starting.	2	September 1, 2022	0
echo show 10	The product is amazing. If you’re into tech or just need an extra screen by the kitchen counter it does the job but the Alexa integration is so SLOW for a product at this price tag. I had to reset to factory defaults twice since I bought it 3 months ago. Showing the Ring camera and controlling your smart home is just way too slow to be useful, most of the times I just open the app on my phone to make it quicker. Bummer that you can’t select the color of RGB smart lights! A lot of room for SOFTWARE improvement. The touchscreen is beautiful and responsive but everything else (and I’m talking about Alexa features like video calls) takes way too long and it’s unresponsive. Maybe a future update will fix it.	3	September 1, 2022	1

echo show 10	Ever since I've purchased the Echo Show 10, It felt very low quality. I am not sure if this was a refurbished product but it did not meet my expectations. The device felt extra slow for a 3rd generation product; The touch screen is not always responsive. The settings menu freezes a lot; Sometimes it crashes and goes to idle or Screen Saver mode while I'm in the middle of interacting with the menu. It is not consistent with announcements, especially when someone is at my front door; Also the Camera does not always show an image of the front door. The front camera does not always recognize me (male) from everyone else in my house (all Women). I thought a New software update may be able to help but it was worst. The Unit Does not work with multiple compatible Bluetooth Speakers as promised.Amazon Please Help!!	1	August 25, 2022	0

echo show 10	I use this regularly and it is good for older parents and kids. But it's so sloppily implemented, particularly around the basics. The response times are slow for core functions like starting or ending a call, and it is constantly fussing about its range of motion. When it works it's pretty amazing- tracks your voice and often makes very astute decisions about how to zoom, pan, etc. But, again, the basics are clunky and that's what I'm contending with most of the time.	2	August 25, 2022	0
echo show 10	Good screen and better voice recognition than other echo show devices. Motion following is a gimmick that doesn't work well and doesn't turn off when the motion off option is selected. Overall, far too much money for a slightly better echo show. Sorry I missed the return window.	3	August 25, 2022	1
echo show 10	"Pretty much a useless overpriced piece of junk. What's the point of installing a tablet on an echo device if it doesn't do anything a touchscreen device from even 15 years ago could. Pretty lame. It has almost zero app support or usability. Even if you manage to get it to go to Amazon Prime or Netflix you can't properly navigate through it.How are they going to pretend you can use Netflix, Amazon Prime or other streaming services simply by talking to it but not being able to actually visually navigate through it in a reasonable manner?I use YouTube music, the only way to use it on the echo Show is to use it through the internet and it is so slow, laggy and glitchy it's not even worth using, it truly is that bad. Even if you use Amazon music you can't click on an album and see all the tracks it's virtually useless how am I going to look through my music by talking to it? There's no reason it can't allow you to navigate through your music by using the touch screen, it's absolutely terrible.This would be the equivalent of only being able to speak to your tablet then your tablet giving you very limited information based on what you asked, the whole point of the echo show is that you're supposed to also have touch screen and interface usability beyond just speaking to it.In Amazon's defense the only thing I can say is they did call it the Echo Show.There's no excuse it can't support any app or function as a tablet except they have gone completely out of their engineering it not to. You installed a tablet on the device, it should work as one but it doesn't so I see no point in its existence. I don't need a display to kind of show me what I asked with the least information given.Even the most mundane of tasks asking it the weather the best you get is the temperature as it shows the temperature on screen with zero other information or even something to click on to give you more, nothing. What do I need that for??I could look at my thermometer outside my window for that. What an absolute joke.It's just a $250 display that sits on my counter now. Great, thanks Amazon for manufacturing a useless device!!Another huge thing is for the amount of space there is for a speaker in the device it has subpar sound at best.I have speakers half the size of this that sound better with fuller sound and dynamic range.Seriously, this device was excessively ""dumbed down"".I wish I could send it back still and get my money back.Don't waste yours."	1	August 25, 2022	0

echo show 10	Our son recently gave us an Echo Show.  We set it up in the kitchen.  Being a geek, I linked it to our WiFi, our Echo Dot, and our nearby TV.

echo show 10	"The 3rd generation Echo Show 10 is worse at picking up voice commands, has worse audio, but the screen can be completely vertical which helps for video calling. Overall, I'm not happy upgrading from the 2nd gen to the 3rd gen.This version of the echo show 10 is objectively worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10 at picking up voice commands. This manifests itself in either doing nothing, hanging (taking 15 seconds or so for the blue ""listening"" stripe to disappear, where you can't interrupt it), or asking to repeat your command. It was so bad, I finally decided to return it, but realized I'm outside of the return window. Hence, this review instead.The sounds quality is also worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10. Specifically, voices in audio are just harder to hear from a few yards away compared to the 2nd generation. It feels like the audible spectrum gets distorted quite easily, even at lower volumes. Turning the volume up just gets cluttered and noisy.I bought this device for the sake of making video calling easier. The fact that the screen can be tilted and get completely vertical is great, as the last generation pointed upwards about about 10 degrees. When making calls with our kid, we'd have to prop up the back end of the 2nd gen Echo Show, and this devices solves that problem. It does this very well.I was going to gift my 2nd generation Echo Show 10 to someone, but I think I'm switching back to that and giving this one away. I'm pretty disappointed with this Echo."	2	August 22, 2022	0

echo show 10	This isn’t about the product. It’s the deal Amazon offered with the Show plus the Blink camera. I put it in my cart, paid for it, and had a shipping date. Then Amazon sent only the Show and refunded me only the low “bundle” price for the Blink camera. That was, of course, not enough to buy it separately. Very bad business! What’s really aggravating is that I took the option of registering the devices to my account for easier setup. Now all my Echo devices show the non-existent Blink camera in their devices lists.	1	August 22, 2022	0

echo show 10	I chose this device for my 4 year old ASD grandson’s room for several reasons. It is big and heavy, reducing the chance that he will try to carry it around. He loves music. He does not yet use words to communicate but will say words with a song. He is good with scrolling devices and can find his music that way. The screen moves and follows his movement around the room. I feel a little bad about not giving a higher score for Alexa integration because it does everything any other Alexa device does. Because of our special needs, I wish there was a better manual control option for those who are nonverbal.	3	August 22, 2022	1

I actually had to change the name from “Alexa” to one of the other names because all the units in the house would respond before the 10” would.  Half the time it doesn’t understand what I’m saying, it’s nerve racking.  Unfortunately, my return window has passed. The speaker’s good for music and the screen is nice.

echo show 10	I upgraded my original version of the Echo Show with this model.  I find the camera, the screen and the sound to be great and definitely worth the upgrade.  And the ability the tilt the screen up and down is a big plus.  We have this in the kitchen/family room area which is open and the sound travels nicely around the space.  The people we have called on the device have all said how much better the camera is on their end.  The only thing that is still to be determined is the follow motion (circular path of the screen).  It took us a few uses to figure out that a ceiling fan and TV image was causing the focus to try to adapt and created some left and right rotation when we hadn't moved.  Once we isolated that, the feature is interesting, but we have not really found a need for it and have since disabled it.  I would not pay extra for the rotating screen feature, but the rest of the updated features are outstanding.	4	August 21, 2022	1

echo show 10	Update: I changed tatimg from two stars to one star. A kind representative called me based in my first review to try to fix said issues below.It worked for awhile but no more.I don't enjoy sports. I hay gone to settings and toggled off all sports-related content. Unplugged/replugged multiple times. Yet, the majority of content that comes across my Show screen is sports-related.Too late to send back. Clearly, though, the Show I received is faulty. I'm really ticked.————First, the motion ability is worthless. I wake up early in the morning. Echo let's me know there's not enough light for it to sensor motion despite having all living room lights on. As such, I disabled this feature.But what I'm most disappointed about is that when I upload my own pictures on the Alexa app, I have to unplug the device and plug back in for the new pics to show. Ridiculous.Next, when I saw the Show's speaker, I was excited thinking the sound would be superb. It's not. The sound sounds the same as the very first Show.I wish I would have kept my previous show. Lesson learned. I'd send this one back for a rwolacy but don't want to go through all the rigamarole.This Show isn't worth $250	1	August 21, 2022	0

echo show 10	Even for a techno klutz like me it was easy to set up. I am still trying to learn all its functions, You Tube videos help some. It is a bit clumsy to move from room to room it would be easy to slip out of your hands. If some kind of handle could be added that would be nice. Also minor point but the white cord with the charcoal echo looks wierd, but not a major problem.	5	August 21, 2022	1

echo show 10	I love the features…Follow feature is great.Recipes for cooking integration is perfect.The screen lags when touching. Works best with “Alexa” commands.Sometimes it gets stuck on apps/skills.Have to jump through hoops to get it to turn off music sometimes.Mostly I love it…	3	August 20, 2022	1
echo show 10	I received it as a gift from my son. The whole family is enjoying itLB	5	August 20, 2022	1
echo show 10	Not bad as an alexa but the problem comes in when you try to multitask with this. For instance if you're watching Netflix and you ask it to turn off the lights it stops Netflix and you have to restart up Netflix to continue your movie.  Also if you have reminders set it overrides what you're currently doing such as watching a movie Etc. Sometimes you ask it to stop doing a task such as stop playing movie and it does not It still needs bugs worked out	3	August 20, 2022	1
echo show 10	Everything	5	August 20, 2022	1
echo show 10	I like it the big problem is where to put it. In the main living room or office. I'm in the office more so selected there. Works well and when the Ring has motion or person it will let me know. Can also view it from there. I do have a smart TV with Alexa which I can view Ring from the TV, so the office was the best choice. I do have to reset from time to time, not a big deal it comes back and works perfectly. As an update has improved since I modified my network. Looks to be on my side issue.	5	August 20, 2022	1
echo show 10	I like it, the rest of the family was a little uneasy at first (creep factor?) but quickly got used to it and are enjoying its features.	5	August 20, 2022	1

echo show 10	I had really high hopes for this Echo Show.  I traded in my Echo 8 that I really liked because I wanted more robust sound and features while I'm in the living room/kitchen area.  While I agree that the sound is better, I'm pretty disappointed in how slow the response and functionality is compared to my Show 8.  I'll call out for Alexa in the room and the other units in other rooms detect my voice and the Show 10 will respond a few seconds later or sometimes no response at all. I don't like the motion following me so that's disabled so it's mostly for the audio at this point, especially since there's no Youtube video integration with Alexa devices.  I still use it, but for the price I paid and getting rid of the Echo 8 has made me lose favor with the Show 10.	3	August 20, 2022	1

echo show 10	I like the sound and I like that I can ask it what am I holding and it tekkies me. this is a great feather for a person such as myself that is blind. I use it in the kitchen to help me with cooking. sorry that I can not rate the screen quality. as a whole I would tell ny friends both sighted and blind it is a very useful tool in the kitchen.	4	August 19, 2022	1
echo show 10	Don’t buy this, it never works, always does the opposite u ask and when u try to get help or return, the costumer service will be rude to you and yield at you. But pass that it never work, I have gotten 2 of them with the promise from Amazon that this second one will work best and it was actually worse than the first one. That’s my feedback and my own experience with this product	1	August 19, 2022	0

echo show 10	I love how it follows while I’m in the kitchen. Extremely helpful	5	August 18, 2022	1
echo show 10	Initially the unit functioned quite well, however after a week, it’s been pretty glitchy. Not understanding certain commands that worked before, not responding to commands at all or sometimes the drop in feature doesn’t function.I’m not one to complain too much but once you feel the full functionality of something only for it to slow down in performance or not operate as it use to, it gets a little frustrating.	3	August 18, 2022	1

echo show 10	While this item integrates with Alexa, it will not work with our Alexa enabled Sonos speakers, contrary to advertising.  The sound quality of the speaker is poor - nowhere near the Sonos quality - and it will not play when we tried to pair it to a Sonos speaker in the same room.  We hope to find an alternative in the future.	2	August 18, 2022	0

echo show 10	Todo perfecto	5	August 17, 2022	1
echo show 10	The product has a great screen and the capability to follow the noise in the space is great. In some ways it is too responsive - if someone makes a noise in another area of the house, the screen moves to the sound of the noise vs staying in the place it heard the last voice.screen quality is great. Speaker quality is very good and it takes up very little space for the benefits offered.	4	August 17, 2022	1
echo show 10	Works so well to talk with my elderly mom. She can see me and most importantly, she can hear me. The volume range is great.	5	August 17, 2022	1
echo show 10	I will say I did give it 5 stars and I would buy it again I do wish it had better access to recipes and hopefully that will come with time but that is the only negative I can think of and that's not bad. I am sure it does a lot more then I actually use it for. I do keep it on top of my fridge so its not in the way and I can see the screen just fine. Great sound and screen size.	5	August 17, 2022	1

echo show 10	Up until getting this device, we were still using our OG Echo (from like 2014) in our kitchen. Finally bit the bullet and upgraded. Love this device, haven't tested the full range of features..but Alexa and Echo has come a long way from the original device!	5	August 15, 2022	1
echo show 10	I put it in the kitchen for recipes mostly; but we ask her every day about the temps and weather. The photo's from my phone are saved in Amazon cloud which have transferred to Alexa. I found this very cool. I love that you can also sing along with the words to the song playing. We love our Alexa echo.	5	August 15, 2022	1
echo show 10	Great device. Awesome look and feel, a good sound and price. And many useful functions. Remote camera drop in and camera scan panning. Along with all the other echo function this is a device to have.	5	August 15, 2022	1
echo show 10	If it just did in a simple way what you ask it to do, that would be perfect. But it's always pushing into your personal information. Plus it lack the simplicity that would be helpful. I just want this and it with continue to add stuff until it's an irratation. Not to mention recording what you say and do (video) as it's listening. Not for me.	1	August 15, 2022	0
echo show 10	The device is helpful for all things related to Alexa, good with connecting to our Ring cameras, good with finding tasty new recipes and great with being a digital picture frame on a loop. I do wish it had additional video services - it does have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and a few others but I'd like to see Apple+, Paramount+, Peacock and Sling added. The device has the ability to turn and face you no matter where you are in the room, which is nice sometimes but doesn't work as well if another person is in view. Also, since the camera isn't centered on the device, it seems like the tracking is sometimes a bit off. Overall, I'm happy with the device, especially the sound quality and volume.	4	August 15, 2022	1
echo show 10	Half the screen doesn't recognize when you're touching it. You ask it one thing and it answers something random like the local weather or something. Terrible device, stay away at all cost. Customer service was no help either, I will never buy another Amazon device. Manager I spoke with who could solve the problem just transferred me to someone else and that person transferred me to someone else. Terrible service and terrible product	1	August 15, 2022	0

echo show 10	Easy to setup. Cumbersome to move around so a set location is best. The pull menus on the screen don’t always respond to the first swipe. Decent features and settings. Good video and audio output. Paid sale price but still feel it’s a bit overpriced	4	August 14, 2022	1

echo show 10	The Alexa Show 10 was really disappointing. Firstly, the stock photo showing the Home Screen with weather pinned to the side is just false advertising because that’s not something it can actually do, I even reached out to Amazon Tech Support to see if I was just missing something.. nope, they confirmed this product cannot do that. I was expecting a SMART interface where I could pin apps, sticky notes, reminders, holiday countdowns, etc.. but NO! This alexa does not have that capability, it is not customizable . If you have a lesser Alexa product like the dot, picture that capability but with a screen. It’s essentially a TV/Bluetooth speaker for your kitchen	2	August 13, 2022	0
echo show 10	Works really well especially when the screen can follow you around the room. Speaker is as good or better than the previous Show but you definitely need space around this Echo Show for it to properly rotate the screen and follow you.	5	August 13, 2022	1

echo show 10	The product is great! Screen is bright. The voice recognition is as great. The sound is amazing, compared to my Echo Dot.The main reason I got this was to keep an eye on things when I'm away. Unfortunately, you cannot do that over mobile network. You can only view the Live View over a wifi network. It doesn't have to be the same one. This is a inconvenience for me. And something worth noting prior to purchase.I can settle for it, as I am finding it useful for organizing my day, video chatting with family, dropping in, making announcements etc.Other than that tid bit, all works as advertised or described.Sometimes a factory reset (first option) does the trick in resolving any technical errors you may come across.	4	August 11, 2022	1
echo show 10	"I have various issues with this device.First is the way it reacts to ""show me how"" commands. Sometimes it will pull up a video on YouTube, and other times it will just pull up web options for you to tap on, which doesn't help when you have your hands in food.Second is the face tracking on this device. It always overshoots to the left because the camera is in the top right corner, and if you move your face in front of the screen, it will turn away from you. It also will occasionally lock onto something else when it overcompensates like a paper towel roll causing it to basically face the wall.Last complaint is the unnecessarily tedious process to use your own recipes in alexa. You have to manually go through and add them to the recipe database for Alexas ""all recipes"" app, and I haven't found a way to just import an existing recipe from other sites."	4	August 11, 2022	1
echo show 10	I found myself barely using the equipment. For the price I paid, I want to use the equipment and not have it just sit on the counter. I returned because the Echo Show just didn’t fit my lifestyle right now.	3	August 11, 2022	1

echo show 10	Set the motion range or it will spin like Linda Blair in the Exorcist.  Great picture, nice sound quality.  I just wanted this to watch TV in the kitchen and it fits perfectly on my shelf.  Alexa like all her devices still has a mind of her own even in this high priced range. I still love it to watch TV in the kitchen! Hulu and Netflix is on there so you just have to sign in.  Apple Music is tricky but can be done, that’s a horse of a different color.	5	August 11, 2022	1

echo show 10	Overall amazing smart home device from Amazon. The ability to turn it almost 360 degrees for home monitoring makes it a perfect  home security device as well. However the screen never faces you if you are close to it. Instead, it turns few degrees to the left and you get the camera right in-front of you. Hope Amazon fixes this. Otherwise I would have given a five star.	4	August 10, 2022	1

echo show 10	Alexa is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!! After a half hour of having these set up, they set off an alarm that would not turn off via the app or speaking to the stupid Alexa devices!! SO IRRITATING!!! I had to run around the house and unplug each device!!!! Absolute GARBAGE!!!	1	August 10, 2022	0
echo show 10	Very slow and freezes up quite a bit. Very consistent with the rest of Amazon hardware and software. Luckily I paid around $80 after trade in etc etc etc. I do not think this device is worth more than $100 due to its poor performance.  A novice might think this device is “okay” then again it’s too complex to set up and the swivel feature is not quite a gimmick but doesn’t work in anything less than FULL sunlight.	1	August 9, 2022	0
echo show 10	My current echo show device is placed on a corner table between the sofa and recliner. I really liked the idea of display facing the person asking the question. However it fails to rotate unless you keep room lights on 24/7 (Low light warning). Doesn't rotate if the camera privacy window is closed. Gets confused about who asked the question if TV is on. Also places requested items in a small window example show Ring Front door bell and then asking to show a different device. So you have to reach over and close or maximize window. If I wanted to touch a display I can do that on my phone. This didn't happen on earlier models. Returning the item	3	August 9, 2022	1

echo show 10	This Echo Show 10 is a great assistant. Great sound when playing music, great quality when showing my pictures. It’s also a good way to see what’s happening at home. Just pick up your phone, tap your Alexa icon, ask to drop in at home, and see and hear your home space while on the phone. Good security!	5	August 9, 2022	1

echo show 10	I use it primarily for music in my bedroom and the quality of sound is tremendous for 1 small speaker.	5	August 9, 2022	1
echo show 10	After a year of ups and downs, the downs are now far more than the perks. The microphone seems to be “going”, thus Alexa doesn’t hear your commands or hears what she wants to hear. The sound quality is quickly diminishing and there have been no significant upgrades or fixes during the time I’ve owned this device. I feel it’s money wasted.	1	August 8, 2022	0

echo show 10	I had a gen 1 show and it worked well for what i needed. Decent sound quality a big screen compared to my other devices a good microphone and ease of user interface. I wanted to step up to the next device that had improved screen, appearance and sound. It meets all of these expectations, but it doesn't blow me away in anyway. That is why i gave it a 4 rather than 5.	4	August 8, 2022	1
echo show 10	I'm really enjoying my Echo it fun to use. It worth it you'll enjoy it. Also the request for different request for recipes anything I can think of. Videos from my home is really clear too. Learning more usage of Echo I'm glad I purchase it.	5	August 8, 2022	1

echo show 10	The only thing I really didn’t like was whenever I went to plug it in the cord was white and it’s kinda hard to hide a white cord with the black Alexa .	5	August 7, 2022	1
echo show 10	Since installing our new Alexa Show 3rd generation, we've been disappointed with the response. The response is slower and the correct response is not as frequent.  It's been frustrating.  I do like the screen.  It is big and easier to see.	3	August 7, 2022	1
echo show 10	It all works pretty good except fo using the browser to search, im pretty disappointed with how difficult it was to search the web	4	August 7, 2022	1
echo show 10	I bought this version not realizing the motion detector would be so useful while cooking. It displays my recipe and always moves to face wherever I am in the kitchen. No more having to walk over just to see the recipe again!	5	August 7, 2022	1
echo show 10	This device is a good idea however it doesn’t work most times when using the “drop in” feature.  I have it at my Mom’s house to check in on her from a distance.  I use the drop-in feature because at this point the device is too complicated for her to use.  The problem with the feature is that when I end the connection on the Alexa app to the echo 10 the echo 10 does not hang up.  This prevents a new connection next time I try to drop-in.  The only solution is to get in my car and drive there to press the screen’s red “end icon”.  Once that is done I can then initiate a new “drop in” call.  This seems to be an easy fix for the programmers at Amazon.  Just have the echo 10 timeout the “drop in” call if there are no activities from the caller.  Yes, I chatted with their tech support.  About 12 of them.  Annoying as hell.  You just get passed on from one tech person to another tech etc.  with no one knowing what to do. I felt I knew more about the echo 10 then amazon’s tech support.  All 12 of them. It’s a shame.  And being an engineer I certainly know more about solving problems than all of them.  I am going to keep the device because it does save me one daily trip.  Drop in, works at lease once a day after my drive there to touch the “end” call icon.  However the product truly is not ready for prime time.  If 12 Amazon techs and me (engineer), and many hours chatting with them cannot resolve the problem. The echo 10 needs much more bug fixes.	3	August 7, 2022	1
echo show 10	This is by far been the most disappointing purchases I’ve made.Long time alexa fan and own over 5 different devices across the home. If you’re looking to automate your home and/or have a multi room sound system, I HIGHLY recommend that you DONT choose alexa.Unfortunately, this has been a rare product that gets worse with time - strictly talking software and functionality not hardware.Owning echos for about 3 years now, the first year was great and since then the software, app, connectivity between Alexa’s and functionalities have géstela deteriorated.I’ve tried everything to reset, update, to no avail. Software is just not Amazons strong suit and it clearly shows. I’ve spent hours with customer service agents trying to help and it boils down to they don’t know how to “fix it” or will pass it on to developers. Aka, yeah sucks it happened but thanks for buying though! Now, I will say they’ve been kind and tried to help but it’s just a poor quality product.From constant music issues, to alexa devices turning on and off on its own, regression in functionalities, I regret having dove in deep to the alexa ecosystem.For my offices I’ve since switched to other home devices as tests and so far so good. It’s safe to say I will be switching over to a different home automation system	1	August 7, 2022	0

echo show 10	All the problems we had with our original Echo (not a ton but big enough to be slightly annoying at times) are now incorporated into a device with a screen and it’s own additional glitches and not so user friendly. :|	3	August 7, 2022	1

echo show 10	I really do love this. I can find recipes, play music, and make lists all at once.	5	August 6, 2022	1
echo show 10	The voice recognition is not nearly the quality of our other Show’s. Very disappointing consider the price point. We have completed all  the voice prompts twice and it still isn’t any better.	3	August 6, 2022	1

echo show 10	My wife and I are really pleased and really enjoying it, but we had several issues during setup, saying it didn't go smootly is to go short, it got stuck 3 times during the process, we had to unplug it and plug it again, the first time we though it had issues with the distance from the main wifi router, but then we did the rest of the setup with the wifi router right next to it, it got stuck a couple of more times, and we had to unplug/plug it two more times.	4	August 6, 2022	1
echo show 10	When I bought this echo, I was thinking is a full service android with possibility to have Skype on it and talk with family, because this is showing in the advertising video. But unfortunately it doesn’t have skype and you can not install it. Is hard in instruction and only I can use it for now when some one rings my doorbell and kid’s watch some videos, but same thing can do the iPad which have more functions.This is more like design bot utility.	1	August 6, 2022	0
echo show 10	I like how quick it responds voice commands	5	August 6, 2022	1
echo show 10	It’s much bigger than I had expected and the speaker on it is amazing. We bought it for our kitchen so we could listen to music or watch our favorite shows while we cook and it has been exactly what we needed.	5	August 6, 2022	1
echo show 10	The screen is brilliant,  the tracking feature allows me to move around the room while the device rotates to keep me in the video call.  It does all the skills every other echo does.It fails epically to allow for permitted contacts as well as myself while away,  to drop in on the device.  If there is no work around,  a refund will be forthcoming.	2	August 5, 2022	0
echo show 10	I'm happy with it but wish it had more live channels like News etc. I really love the feature that follows you around and zooms in, especially when I drop in to other echo shows for example with my mom overseas or with my son in college. I know, there's apps like FaceTime and WhatsApp that work really well but my mom is really old and this device allows me to video call without her lifting a finger.	4	August 5, 2022	1
echo show 10	The whole family loves it. My kids can answer the doorbell without having to be near the front door. My wife and kids all love listening to music, the sound quality is excellent.	5	August 5, 2022	1
echo show 10	This device has a 10 inch rotating screen, speakers with subwoofer, and an integration hub.  No other Alexa device has all three.  That makes this the most feature-rich device, currently.  It works surprisingly well with one small exception.  The screen rotates to track you during video calls, video streaming, music, and more.  However, it could be a bit more sensitive or precise.  We have a larger kitchen and it is relatively easy to step outside the tracking range.  When this happens the screen can stall at a position that is less than optimal.  Otherwise, it is a great device and we continue to learn new skills everyday.	4	August 5, 2022	1
echo show 10	We are loving the Echo Show 10. The sound and screen quality are awesome. Working with Alexa is great. However, the part where the show follows you is a little off at times. If you go out of the area where it can see you, a message pops up on the screen every single time. Kinda annoying. Maybe there is a setting to change that. Also, doesn't always pick up when it's supposed to follow you. But most the time it works well.	4	August 5, 2022	1
echo show 10	The Echo show is not really bad, but it keeps losing connecting to the net and you have to unplug it and then reboot for it to reconnect.	4	August 5, 2022	1
echo show 10	Great sound quality and the screen is a good size. It’s annoying sometimes if the kids move it and it says we moved out of the range set but it’s really not that big of a deal. Overall we are very happy with this purchase	5	August 4, 2022	1
echo show 10	It’s a beautiful picture quality. The sound is okay and it doesn’t really follow me me like it should. Finding it pretty difficult to do video calls the quality is… I should have kept my other Echo show🤷🏾‍♀️	4	August 4, 2022	1
echo show 10	It is Inconvenient unit to have but it does severely struggle to accurately respond the voice commands and my current unit seems to move incredibly slow	4	August 4, 2022	1

echo show 10	Love the whole Alexa echo system, the new Alexa show 10 has many cool features plus it can rotate and follow you, I noticed the mic doesn't catch all my requests/ commands compared to the small echo.	4	August 4, 2022	1

echo show 10	Roomie got this 'thing' from a friend as a gift. Not sure why, long standing. As special bulbs had to be 'ordered' just to make it work. Well, that was the easy part.... talk about a huge waste of energy, and time. It doesn't respond half the time to voice commands. Which is more than beyond irritating. .. Don't blame it on poor wiring.  It's technology with too many bugs to bother with.  Be glad when I move out... and use real light switches again.	1	August 4, 2022	0
