She is not capable of answering almost any question, including her own model or specifications. And after a dozen tries, she still could not connect to my device. Alexa used to be far simpler, far less expensive, and work far better.Is it time to convert to Google smart home, or is that just as bad?Addition: After posting this review, Amazon Customer Service called me and was able to assist me in connecting this Echo to my devices. I have added two stars to reflect that service.I remain disappointed that I had to buy two new Echoes and devices to connect to them merely because Comcast replaced my router with a newer model. And it is still the case that this Echo provides less assistance than the older models I had.

       " 'Echo Auto  Hands free Alexa in your car with your phone\\tThis was the last straw for me with Alexa. I am switching to google assistant!I had been eagerly waiting for over a year for the echo auto to come out. It seemed like the perfect addition to my “non-smart” 2007 BMW.First of all, it always has connection issues right as I’m leaving my house (i.e. the time I most often need to use it). It seems to really struggle with my phone switching from home WiFi to cellular connection (which is odd because I don’t have this issue on my phone itself).Second of all, the speakerphone is garbage. It sounds worse than the iPhone speakerphone to whoever you’re calling.Third of all, and most importantly, the navigation integration with your phone is awful. On iPhones it currently only works with Apple Maps- Google Maps users are SOL. It also tries to use some Amazon service to disambiguate the location you request. I tried to go to a restaurant near my house in California, and it ended up sending me to Vermont!I quickly switched to using google assistant on my phone, and it found the restaurant with no issues.There are plenty of other smaller issues I had with product (why would I want to listen to Panic at the Disco instead of Queen when I ask to hear Bohemian Rhapsody?), mostly having to do with the intelligence of Alexa.I stuffed it into my center console to be used solely as a Bluetooth audio receiver a few weeks ago, but was motivated to write this review when I saw an incredibly misleading advertisement for the echo auto during Sunday night football.I have been using Alexa for over four years and have bought echoes for friends over that time, but it only seems to be getting worse with every iteration.

Overall I am pretty happy with the Echo Show and Alexa after a few weeks.The device has a very impressive speaker with excellent sound quality including bass. Alexa wakes easily and is pretty good at understanding what you are asking for, though sometimes she can get lost when I ask for specific songs or recipes. Alexa knows my voice and sometimes she will even say my name though it freaked me out at first. The picture looks amazing, though the screen is prone to gathering dust from the viewing angle, and if you use this in your kitchen like I am, be careful about splashes and splatters. The timer, reminder, and alarm features have all been extremely helpful, and I like setting up the home screen to act like a news ticker. Smart home integration was pretty easy with the Amazon branded plugs I bought to control a few lamps, but it takes quite a bit more patience to connect third party smart devices like an air conditioner.The motion feature needs a little work. Alexa will follow anyone who walks by the camera, which can be frustrating when there are two people moving around the room and you are trying to see something on the screen. She also needs a pretty big area so if you are working in a small space keep that in mind.

It has a difficulty recognizing me telling it to stop the timer when it goes off. In addition I have Arlo cameras for which there is direct integration to work with Alexa. However I find it that it takes a very long time to load at times (upwards of 2 minutes) and on occasion it doesn’t load the camera feed at all. Overall I would have to say this is a 3 star device.

       " \"Echo Auto  Hands free Alexa in your car with your phone\\tI wanted Alexa Auto to be able to access everything that I do on our home Echos--with just as much ease. So here is one of my primary problems with this item: It does not play nice with my car's built-in phone/entertainment system. It is all-or-nothing Alexa Auto. I have Alexa throughout our home (lights, security, music, etc.), but I DO NOT let her have access to any of our phone contact lists--she accidentally sent a voice memo to my boss one day and that was the only lesson I needed. So, for this reason, Alexa Auto does not have access to the calling feature in my car--which is a huge hassle. I have to dial from my phone instead of via Bluetooth as I usually did (via my car). I trust Toyota with my contact list, while I'm in the car, but not Alexa. However, with Alexa in the car, my car's call feature is disabled. It's a mess.Plus, every time I get in the car I have to connect my phone to Alexa Auto--it keeps disconnecting...this shouldn't be so complicated.Then, on top of all of this, I have hearing loss and wear blue-tooth enabled hearing aids, and Alexa Auto immediately connects to my hearing aids whenever I enter the car....I don't necessarily want the car's music in my ears all the time, plus anyone else in the car can't hear the music because it's being looped directly into MY HEAD.Finally, the vent adapter that came with it falls off immediately, so the Alexa has to lay in one of the cup holders. It was in the way and the cord was ugly.I would have sent it back, but I foolishly threw the packaging away. I do not use this. It is laying in the garage. I'm SO glad I didn't pay hardly anything for this. I LOVE my Alexas in the house, but really hate this.\\t1\\tNovember 12, 2019\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n",
       " 'Echo Show 8\\t\"After using the 2 Echo Dots I just received I was really hoping for an enhanced experience with the Show 8. Set up was fine. But, from the jump the Show just had trouble hearing. I have tried all of the wake words and the only one that even comes close to working is \"\"computer\"\". I used different words for each device, the same for all and various combos of two of one and one for the other. I even tried it with the Dots unplugged. The Echo Dots hear me from anywhere in my place and do not fight over which one is going to carry out the request. The Show misses its wake word at least 35 percent of the time no matter the distance and then its a fight to get it to understand what I want. Also, when I aske the Echos for the weather they sometimes make sure to tell me the city. However even though they are all set to my exact location in all three areas of the software and device settings, they give me the weather for the main city in the area not for my city which is still in the top seven for Ohio. The temp and conditions many times vary a lot between the two cities even with an only 11 mile difference. Main city is right up against Lake Erie at a lower elevation.  Accuweather, Weather Bug, Weather.com and everyone else know the difference between the two. However the Alexa software which I am told uses Accuweather can\\'t seem to shake the problem. Customer service was no help, just told me to try a skill. I can get the correct weather. I just need the weather that is displayed on the home screen of the Show to be correct and not embarrassingly wrong. If I didn\\'t get it for only 70 dollars with a 24 dollar smart plug it would be going back today. But no Echo Dots are available for at least a month. Then I will wind up paying more than I did on prime day without the additional freebies.

I researched it pretty thoroughly before buying it. I am by no means an audio file although I do know what truly high end music reproduction sounds like. For the price the Echo studio is just what the doctor ordered. I was looking for something small and compact that would produce really good sound. The Echo Studio does just that. I have it placed on the bottom shelf of my entertainment center and the sound is fantastic. The microphones pick up my voice OK in that location, however as with all echo products, when placed near a TV  the microphones do not pick up my voice as well. I placed the Studio in another location for test purposes and found that the microphones were actually better than any other echo products I own. You can't go wrong with this speaker if you want good sound in a compact size. I have since bought a second Echo Studio in order to set up home theater. Amazing sound that fills the room.

The device has to have a direct connection to your vehicle sound system through the auxiliary input and to power (USB), and your phone has to have the Amazon app. That's it.

It worked very well for a long time have very little to complain about until recently when all of the sudden it would constantly disconnect from my phone and also had a hard time reconnecting or connecting at all.  I went online to see if the device needed a firmware or some other sort of update but from what I read, the Echo Auto gets auto updated from your phone so there is nothing to update, it should be on the latest and greatest. After reading that I thought my device might be going bad because it's been solid for a long time and just recently started having these connectivity issues.  Amazon was running their black Friday specials and I picked up another one for about $20. I figure it was worth a shot to see if a new device would work better or if I just wasted another $20.  Unfortunately I wasted another $20 because I have the same connectivity issues with this device as well. Such a shame too because I really did like using this device and having hands free voice commands as I do with my echo dot at home.  But with the connectivity problems in the car this is almost a hazard trying to get it to connect and it is highly frustrating.  I'm rating this 2 stars for the connectivity issue.

       " 'Echo Auto  Hands free Alexa in your car with your phone\\tDesign:Could come in a more classy look to match the interior of my sports cars, other than that the engineering put into this is remarkable.Functionality:Works as intended, has a hard time understanding me over common noise such as driving, people talking, bluetooth speaker for phone calls is not good at all, i’ve had people on the other line say they can’t hear me or it has a hiss or sounds of static. Don’t know if that’s just user error but I’vd tried a few adjustments and placements and still no dice. For Bluetooth audio for music(not for phone calls) is amazing and really delivers a crisp sound with fantastic bass transfer.Price:A bit over priced but I understand why, it’s the convenience of having an alexa assistant designed for home use IN YOUR CAR. I forgot to turn off the lights in my room and told alexa to turn them off FROM MY CAR. If that’s not impressive for the time period then i don’t know what is. I could think of numerous features that could be added but i also don’t know the difficulties of making such dreams come true.Overall:Impressed but could use some work and maybe a next generation design release.\\t3\\tJanuary 10, 2020\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

However, the screen does not move back to the idle position when you stop interacting with it.  Well, it will when it sleeps, but it only sleeps when nobody is in view of the camera. People are in my kitchen most of the day in my set up, so it is stuck at whatever angle someone last interacted with it until you interact with it again.I spent 3 hours with tech support and 4 unplugs, 3 resets, 5 times recalibrating the motion and checking for updates numerous times to find this out. Really poor support for this device. My initial question seemed simple: \"\"when does the device go back to the idle position?\"\" To be clear, following you is not the same as turning toward you when you say Alexa. The former has preferences, the latter is either on (turns towards you when you say the wake word) or off completely.Anyways, i  hope the development team is listening and they add a command to put the show back to idle position or even better, implements a time out when not in follow mode and the wake word hasn\\'t been spoken. Maybe even move it back to idle position when the camera slider is closed.I\\'ll give it a couple weeks to see if any of this updated before I return the 2 I bought.\"\\t2\\tMarch 2, 2021\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

I know since I spent a lot of time trying to get this speaker to sound decent.

Living in a city, where commuting anywhere outside my immediate suburb, means spending to as little as 20 to as much as almost an hour in the car, I wanted Alexa to play the artists, news outlets and podcasts I like but don't always have time to listen to through my home Alexa. Not to mention, when my 4-year-old granddaughter is in the car and can make her musical requests that she's used to making from the home Alexa, the ride seems a whole lot shorter for us.I had been an early adopter of another device that advertised that it could bring Alexa into the car. It worked great when I was in my driveway, but the minute we got on the open road, away from the house, the Alexa voice would always say she couldn't connect.Because of that experience, I was leery of trying out Amazon's version. But hoping against hope, I bought it and I don't regret it. I saw one article where the writer complained his mobile Amazon Alexa device didn't work for him consistently but I have not had that problem. Compared to my prior device, the Amazon version is just about flawless.If you like extending what you do with Alexa in your home to your car, then I don't think you will be disappointed. The only sad thing is that some members of my family can't use it because their cars don't meet Amazon's restrictive criteria as to which models are compatible.

The device connects pretty seamlessly through your smartphone’s Bluetooth connection and then connects to your car’s audio system with the auxiliary jack.One negative to me is that you have to have the Alexa app open first before you can use the Echo Auto.

But if you get into the habit of opening the Alexa app first, it’s all hand free from there.Another negative is what seems to be a limited number of apps that this device can access. There are many different music apps that you can’t access from the Alexa app, notably YouTube Music and Radio.com. You can still use those apps with the Echo Auto, but you have to manually access those apps first. They then will play through the device to your car.

I don't mind listening to the radio driving around town, but on longer trips it is nice to have hands free access to my music.  I thought this feature worked pretty well.  The navigation, on the other hand, not so much.  Alexa uses my google maps app to obtain directions and if my map app is not open and running, she doesn't work.  So I have to get my phone out while I'm driving in order to open the app and that pretty much defeats the whole purpose of not fooling around with my phone while I'm driving.  I've also had  it disconnect from the car 4-5 times now since I've owned it in the last 4 months and I have to start completely over with set up.  This is frustrating. Granted, it could be my phone but either way I don't have the patience to deal with it. I may just keep it in the glove compartment until I'm going on a road trip.

It will work sometimes but often just defaults to Amazon music.Other than that it works like a normal Alexa which is nice.

Having Alexa perform a routine switch on/ off of lights on the house at certain time, whenever we’re not around is just awesome. Integrating Alexa with your security system is also a must.Echo 8 as a upgrade to my original echo show is even better.

Every time you get in and out of the car the Echo looses connection and takes a long time to reconnect. For several minutes, (I counted over 10 minutes one time) Echo Auto can not reconnect to the phone. I have tried several different phones just to be sure it was not a phone problem. I have tried leaving Echo Auto powered on while I am out of the car and powering it off, (my accessory outlet can be left powered on when when the engine is shut off). No matter what I try Echo keeps responding with \"\"I have lost connect to the phone\"\" or \"\" I have lost connection to the network\"\". I have the simplest connection possible using the Echo Auto connect to my car by Aux cable and using bluetooth only to connect Echo Auto to my phone. There is no chime or any kind of alert as to when it finally reconnects. I have to keep asking Alexa to play music and it keeps responding it has lost connection, finally after several minutes it will start playing music again. Also at seemingly random times as I am driving Alexa just won\\'t respond. There is no ambient sound problem and nothing to interfere with Alexa hearing me, she just doesn\\'t respond for several minutes. I\\'ll turn down the volume to make sure it can hear me and get no response. I\\'ll keep trying and after several minutes it will start working again.

For example, we have turned off all home content besides weather, and disabled rotate continuously. Despite this, the Echo 10 continues to display all content, and rotate through it.

We were very excited about the larger screen, better speakers, video calling with family, and other features, but seeing headline after headline, games, never ending covid content, and Amazon's corporate advertising for their products is becoming so frustrating that it's ruining our experience with the echo show 10. The echo show 8 and 5 both properly display only the home content we have turned on.We have discussed with tech support, rebooted the devices, factory reset them, power cycled, gone through settings with tech support, and more, and had confirmed to us that this is a software issue across the entire echo 10 product line that will require Amazon to release an update to fix their devices.Please fix this issue Amazon, as if it continues our family will all be returning these.Edit: As of 8/24/2021 Amazon technical support reached out to let us know they had resolved this issue. We tested our devices and all now appear to show only the content we have enabled. Thank you for fixing this issue Amazon! With this fix, we have updated our review to four stars.We would consider 5 stars if we could get native YouTube integration (rather than being forced to use the built in web browser to use YouTube), and if the OS for show devices were updated to be more similar to a tablet, at least as far as using apps (such as the Fire tablet line) rather than the extremely stripped down user interface that nearly every app currently is. Amazon should integrate an app store, and allow tablet-like navigation rather than forcing the user to talk to Alexa for most functions.

However, I find it best for music.  I have an iPhone and listen to podcasts often on my commute.  The problem with this device is I can't choose which episode I want to listen to.  And, if I don't finish my podcast on my drive, it does keep a memory of where I last listened.  The other issue is texting.  It makes voice texting easy while driving.

I have been an avid echo device user since they were released and I\\'ve owned and setup dozens of these devices including the 1st, 2nd, and now 3rd gen 10 show. This new device has been so annoying and unsatisfying that we have contemplated \"\"gifting\"\" this thing to someone we don\\'t like.To the review...we have this device setup in the kitchen, replacing the Echo Show 10 2nd gen.Pros: The screen is large and the speaker sound is good. This is where the pros end.Cons: I\\'ll list a few of the cons but won\\'t bore you with all.1. Despite numerous setup wizards and responding to feedback regarding the screen bumping into the wall, the screen continuously bumps into a wall that hasn\\'t moved in the months since I purchased the device.2. Unlike previous models, this echo show doesn\\'t listen very well. My family has to raise their voices so loud to get the attention of this device that other echo devices in the house respond instead of this one. You either raise your voice beyond what should be expected or you have to repeat commands each time you try to access the device.3. The camera follow feature is now more entertainment than usable function. The family enjoys watching the screen turn to the opposite of the room when we try to get the show\\'s attention.4. The Live View camera connection to the Alexa App for iphone\\\\ipad works only occasionally. For comparison, my Wyze cameras respond and can be viewed every time, in the Alexa app. You would think Amazon could get that right with their own app and hardware.Final words...If you have money to waste and are happy to be a beta tester for a product that isn\\'t ready for production release, this is the device for you.\"\\t1\\tJuly 13, 2021\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

I was looking for an alternative to using bluetooth speakers coupled to my phone to play steaming music and I got this on special at $39.95.It far exceeded my expectations. Alexa hears wayyy better than Siri and has more capabilities. The sound quality is much better than the Bluetooth Speakers I had been using. Not as good as a real stereo with a decent set of speakers, but for a softball sized device, the sound is good enough for a kitchen, bedroom, etc.  The bass and treble during playback is decent, but the mid-tones are slightly muddy. However you can adjust the sound using the Bass, Mid-Tone and Treble controls through Alexa or the app. This is like a gateway drug... I'm hooked and I wanted more of them...When I went to order more, the price went up to $49.95 :-(So instead, I ordered a Generation 3 Dot at the $39 price and found it works every bit as well as this Gen 4.When I set the Gen 4 dot on my left and the Gen 3 dot on my right and play the same music simultaneously, I can't tell a difference in the sound quality. Other reviewers have said the Gen 3 sounds better than the Gen 4, some say the exact opposite, but to me they sound EXACTLY the same. And why wouldn't they? The both have the same speaker. So now I have ordered two more Gen 3's.As others have mentioned, I too am surprised that the Gen 4 Charcoal Colored unit comes with a White cord and wall wart, but the Gen 3 comes with black. Why they don't include the same adapter as the Gen3 is beyond me. But too minor an issue to worry about, IMO.\\t5\\tFebruary 21, 2022\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n",

When I get a notification there\\'s someone at my door, with my phone I have to first unlock my phone, then get to the app, then tap the app to open it, then click on Front Door Live View, then wait for the connection. So you can see the difference in speed of view right there. Echo show only takes a few seconds to connect to Ring. The sound on the Show doesn\\'t compare to the sound on my Echo Plus, but when I ask the Show to play a song, the lyrics come up on the screen which is a bonus especially if you are a musician or a karaoke singer!  I recently learned you can slide the camera lens to \"\"closed\"\" which I did. I only realized you can do that because of the little tips the Show displays on the screen. I like that it always has the time and temperature, and suggestions of what you can ask verbally on a line at the bottom of the screen which changes every 10 seconds.  Show gives rotating on-screen suggestions for recipes, tending topics, 4 day weather, suggests videos, Show can connect with other Show users & is especially useful if you want to drop in on Mom to say hello or check on her visually is you have it set up that way. There really is no limit to the capabilities of Show. The only thing I yet have to figure, since I have both the Show and the Plus in the same room, is how to make my music play b only on the Plus if I don\\'t need the lyrics since the Plus is such a better sound system.  I sometimes say Alexa play (this song) on the Echo Plus, & most times she will but not always. Then I\\'ll try Alexa play (this song) \"\"Everywhere\"\" & sometimes music plays on all 3 of my Echo devices, & sometimes she tells me I need to sign up for Amazon Music to do that but I AM signed up for that.  I would like to figure out how to make my Echo Plus the default music player unless I tell it differently. I tried working with the settings in Alexa, that\\'s where you can do it, but it didn\\'t do it. I tried it verbally, to make the Plus the default. Nope. So I will continue to tell Alexa verbally to play it on the Echo Plus until I can figure it out.

Only 2 items to mention that gave it 4 stars vs 5.  One of them could be due to background noise so I will chalk it up to that type of environment.  Therefore, when there is some background noise, it does take 2 to 3 takes before the device responds appropriately.  The other issue is I can tell Alexa to call “mom” or “dad” but when I instruct to call by name (a name in my phone book), it does not recognize it.  Therefore, I end up asking Siri to call for me.  Navigation, “Lets Chat”, other skills works great.The only other thing I wish any of my 6 echo devices would do is when I ask for my calendar events, I personally would like it to access the duration of the appointment.  Other than that, great device!\\t4\\tJanuary 15, 2020\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

It is about the dimensions of a business card and very lightweight.

However, in the event that your vehicle is a little more \"\"senior\"\" and not bluetooth enabled no need to worry you can use the provided auxillary cable and you are fine.  The only negative drawback is that thee is a need to open up the Alexa app whenever you enter into the vehicle, it does not automatically connect when you awake Alexa but once you open the app the echo works fine to retrieve your music, make calls etc. until you leave the vehicle.

I bought 3 of these and all three only lasted about a year until it started having major problems. The speaker got very static-y, when I would set a timer with it, I couldn’t add any more time to it but it wouldn’t tell me that. It would just ring at the initial timer amount set, so needless to say, I had a lot of uncooked meals. And,  It wouldn’t understand a lot of my simple inquiries that I’d asked before with no problem. So if you don’t mind replacing it annually, then it’s a handy thing to have. The speaker on it is pretty weak though. It’s better if you can hook up an external speaker to it.My least favorite thing about this Echo Dot is that the ideal volume for me doesn’t exist..ex: level 4 is too soft and level 5 is way too loud. Oh, and there’s too much bass in the voice and not enough treble so it’s hard to understand unless you’re right close to it. The microphone does have pretty good range though. Sorry that I didn’t measure how far, but I can’t do it now bcz they don’t work as well as they used to.My favorite thing about it is that you can configure it in Settings to not shut down after it answers your question so you can keep talking to it. I like this bcz it’s habit for me to say thank you after somebody answers my question and when it turns off and I say thank you I’m talking to dead air so when it hangs around it actually says you’re welcome or other things that appreciate you.Wow, am I needy!\\t3\\tJune 19, 2021\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

I would have to reconnect it to the wifi almost daily, sometimes restarting my router just to get the stupid thing to reconnect, even though every other device in the home was connected.Ok, maybe there was something wrong with the signal of our router, so we purchased google routers and placed them all over our house to broadcast the signal better.

In order to get the echo play music nowadays we have to unplug it for a minute and then plug it back in and that will last for a while.

The first thing she asked is what browser was I using.  I said I knew from looking on-line for anything that would solve my troubles that you could not use Google/Chrome so I was using Edge.  She said Edge won\\'t work either - you can only use Firefox as the web browser to set it up.  As soon as I signed into that voila - everything worked quickly and all was well.

I don't always sit or stand in the same spot when I was asking questions or making calls, so to see the answer on the show, I would run around to the correct side of the screen.  So I opened it right away when I got home from work, it setup easy as the devices always do with even with the addition of the movement pattern test.

I had just had it moving for the test, so I knew it should work and I kept moving around the room...nothing as far as moving the screen goes (the audio responses were always fine.)  One time when I was testing it from almost directly in front of it, a little message came up that said movement was impaired because it was too dark (something to that effect).  Granted it was dark outside but I had a large screen TV on so it was as light as I usually have it, so I turned on a lamp....no movement....two lamps....no movement and the message came up.  Finally turned on the overhead light, in addition to the 2 lamps and the light from the tv...it finally moved.  Turned off one of the lamps...no movement.  This morning with the sun streaming in the sunroom where I have it positioned, movement works just fine.  So apparently to work right, the room has to be lit up like a movie set...which is not a reasonable situation at all times.

Now, because these aren\\'t outdoor/weather proof, my plan was to install it underneath the eave of the house to protect it as much as possible.  Turns out that I don\\'t have to do that because there\\'s a portable battery/dock for the 3rd gen and you should definitely buy it if you\\'re gonna buy one of these devices.  What I like about the 3rd gen is that it\\'s simple.  I don\\'t need a screen/camera for the garage or for the patio/entertaining.  What I need is music and the 3rd gen is plenty loud, has an adjustable equalizer (FYI, your options are Bass, Middle, and High from -6 to +6 and you just tell the thing which setting and what value... to be honest, it is a little bit \"\"tinny\"\" sounding but it is the older 3rd gen), and has access to all my music and skills I use on the fancier models I have around the place.  The other thing that I like about the whole Alexa system is the shopping list.  So if I\\'m in the garage or anywhere, really, and I run out of something or realize I need something I can just tell Alexa to add that item to the shopping list and then BANG, it\\'s right there on my phone app when I get to the store!  To be honest that\\'s about the only thing I use the devices for.  Now if I had to give it a con this is it.  And this con might be something I just don\\'t know how to do... but you can\\'t say something like, \"\"Alexa, play the Chiefs game,\"\" and expect it to find the game.  You have to know what station is broadcasting it and then tell the thing to play that station.  That\\'s a real pain because sometimes I don\\'t know the radio station because I like teams that aren\\'t just my local home teams.  Anyway, that\\'s about all I don\\'t like about it.  Oh, and that it\\'s not outdoor/weather proof.I didn\\'t tell you this, but another feature I like about all this Alexa stuff is being able to have them all play the same music on all the devices so if you\\'re entertaining or just piddling around and you go from room to room you don\\'t miss a beat on the music.  And they\\'re synched, too, so it\\'s not annoying like 2 different tv\\'s playing the same show but one is a little bit ahead of the other so the audio messes you up.I do know that the devices recognize my voice better than my wife\\'s but that could be because 1) when my wife set up her voice on the machine she tried to speak properly and not the way she talks, 2) when she talks she\\'s got a real \"\"she\\'s from Texas\"\" accent, or 3) maybe Alexa just work well with the frequency of women\\'s voices.

       " 'Echo Auto  Hands free Alexa in your car with your phone\\t\"I drive a Toyota RAV4 basic model with their basic radio and Bluetooth and CD player. I use the car daily for errands and short outings in an area with good cellphone coverage. The Echo Auto is living up to all of my expectations. It works so much, much better than talking to Google. I hope that Amazon continues to improve the spatial discrimination for Echo Auto. I can get my daily briefings and can connect to any of my music streaming services. The music seems to be of better quality that \"\"radio music\"\".  Whenever I leave the car and turn off the ignition, the streaming service will stop and then start right when I get back into the car. I almost never use the radio anymore. Yes, I did upgrade my Verizon account to unlimited data.Echo Auto has some interesting interaction features with my Android phone such as: sending texts, calling friends, asking about what restaurants, gas stations, etc. are near and getting Google Maps to display a route. Sometimes the interactions fail but sometimes it works. I really really hope Amazon can make the Echo Auto interaction process when sending texts, calling friends and getting Google Maps to display a route even more easier.We recently took our car (with Echo Auto) on a 3,000 mile road trip (mostly on US80 with good cellphone coverage). We found that we could ask Alexa for information about the towns and historic sites we were passing through and Alexa would read information from Wikipedia. Alexa, through Echo Auto told us all about the worlds largest gas station on US80 and all about the gigantic wind turbines. Alexa (through Echo Auto) is also pretty good at finding and reading haiku poems. We also had Alexa connect with our Audible account and read a book to us during the trip (\"\"Where the Crawdads Sing\"\" was the book). Alexa would start right beck up when we restarted the car after our break. I can see great entertainment possibilities for a car full of kids. I can say that I would pay extra to Amazon for a subscription-like service with curated content relevant to the areas in which I am travelling. It would need to be two-way voice interactive however. Also, when we had a flat tire on the trip, Alexa through Echo Auto was able to suggest a tire repair place (actually 7 places within 15 miles) and provide a Google Map route to the service center.  This had the effect of decreasing our anxiety and reduced the costs of the tire repair (we did not feel the need to call a tow truck).So I am delighted with the Echo Auto performance. The incremental cost of bringing Alexa into your car is almost nothing. Could it be improved, yes, and I hope Amazon continues to move forward with Echo Auto. I would suggest a adding a device to the Echo Auto \"\"system\"\" that allows query of the vehicle monitoring systems (On-Board Diagnostics 2) and voice report back of the car status. I would suggest adding memory and processing power to the Echo Auto unit so certain types of voice interactions and be handled at the unit level and not completely tethered to Amazon\\'s servers over the internet.  Music (and Audible books) could be downloaded for playback when cellphone coverage is spotty.Thank you Amazon.\"\\t5\\tOctober 7, 2019\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

Also both versions (as well as the Echo Dot) have extremely low signal level on the auxiliary output making connection to a powered speaker or a stereo receiver difficult without some intermediate gain device. As to being deaf, the Echo 4 requires that one must be very close (4-5 feet) or to yell in order for Alexa to receive commands. Also, there is no remote available for Echo 4. The Echo V3 has no such issues and easily understands commands from a reasonable distance (across the room) using a moderate voice level.I have relegated my Echo 4 to a small room and brought back the Echo 3 to the kitchen where I use it most, sometimes with the remote when others are conversing in the room.\\t3\\tFebruary 24, 2021\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

Two weeks I went on vacation, I took a road trip from Pennsylvania to Oklahoma, and a week later drove back.

It is GREAT for aforementioned casual listening, typically with good voice recognition and response. It is NOT quite as accomplished with a stereo pairing for more focused (and higher volume) listening. The Sub really does well with rounding out the frequencies Echo can achieve in music, though it’s no heavy-hitter. Then again, it’s a 6” woofer and not designed to be that, so that’s ok. The Echos themselves do well up until about a 70-75% volume level, then start showing hints of distorting, even harshness. You can adjust the EQ settings, but even bringing down the treble does not resolve the top end being overwhelmed with upper volume.Thus, for a typical/casual music listener that’s not going to push these too much, it’s probably the best all-around Echo! For anyone wanting more of a performance envelope for music reproduction, try the Studio version (or a pair of them!), I’d say.\\t4\\tDecember 4, 2021\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

My car seems reasonably quiet on the road but I still have to raise my voice and direct speech at the device for good pick up when in motion at highway speeds. The main drawback to this device is that it’s really just a Bluetooth microphone and you have to first launch the Alexa app on your phone for it to work, at least in iOS 13. If you forget to do that before you start driving then it doesn’t work because the app prompts you to confirm you’re a passenger before accepting commands. Nuisance.

When you go back to your car and try to get it to do something you need to open the Alexa app on your phone to get it working again, which one should not need to do.For another if you go on to listen to something else through your phone (podcast, an audio book, or music that is not through Amazon Prime ) and the Alexa app is running you will get this second (or two) of silence every so often which is really annoying.

       " 'Echo Auto  Hands free Alexa in your car with your phone\\tEhh...okay, but not impressed..I guess bc I love all the Amazon family of Echo products, I had high expectations. Luckily, I got this as a Xmas gift and didn’t have to pony up money for it myself, and they got it for me on sale almost 50% off—but now I understand why.First, the good:It connects to Bluetooth flawlessly, without fail, and without dropping out. I don’t know what version, but it’s pretty recent and very stable. So if you have a stock/factory head unit that has Bluetooth, or a mediocre or even crappy aftermarket head unit with a decent Bluetooth connection, you’re probably going to be in hog heaven with the upgrade to your car stereo system with this. I’m a nerd though, and super bougie about my car audio—so I have the flagship head unit from a big name electronics company that has wireless Apple Car Play (the first to have it).With that being said, here’s the bad:If you have Apple Car Play, you don’t get to have your cake and eat it too—no car play AND Bluetooth at the same time....not exactly anyway.It basically forces you to pick one over the other. Well, Apple Car Play isn’t lossy like Bluetooth (Google lossy audio or Bluetooth audio quality if you’re so inclined to read about how and why Bluetooth audio sounds like crap compared to a wired connection or WiFi connection). So I’m not going to opt for Bluetooth when I can have the splendor of FLAC or at least 300 audio compared to 96 (or worse...gasp...48) quality.Anyhow, that being said, it’s nice to be able to ask Alexa the usual questions like at home on the Echo’s, and when you pull into the driveway (and hit the WiFi) to ask her to turn on the house lights or unlock the front door.But I seldom use her in my truck. I refuse to ask Siri anything. I’m an Apple fan boy, but even more so about anything Echo.The good and bad are covered. Here’s the mediocre:The microphones. Much like the original echo’s, the mic’s leave a lot to be desired. If the radio is up even marginally loudly....she probably won’t hear you, unless you speak very loudly or yell. So that kinda sucks.All in all, I’d say this one ranks 3.5/5 stars...better than average....but I’m grading on nearly no Bell curve here since the other Echo products are generally 5/5 or 4.5/5. If I’m comparing to any other Bluetooth connection for the average person’s car, it’s light years ahead—I’m just judging against extreme quality and expectations of more of the same.Hope this helps someone.

       " 'Echo 4th Gen\\tA very poor “whole house” audio solution. What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough “free with Prime” music that you want to listen to, it won’t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn’t further Amazon’s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.“Whole House Audio”??? That’s a joke. It won’t let you play your own music from your phone on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play radio apps on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play audio books on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the “everywhere group”. Basically it’s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only “whole house audio” for being tied to Amazon’s pay streaming music.If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the “everywhere group”: First, it will tell you that you can’t play music on the “everywhere group” because music is already playing on another unit. But It’s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.Let’s say you’re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don’t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that has  another unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn’t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more “stuff”.So you’ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don’t expect true whole house audio and don’t expect them to work together as a group of units.

Well, same old story, they started using a third party to make their hardware and after months of fidgeting with it, I threw it all away and got this.  Of course, I had to switch most of my Z-wave over to Zigbee, including wall switches, the door lock, etc.  Luckily, I can do all that stuff myself.

It lets me access my smart home items from any Alexa app, including my car, phone, computer, and all the Echoes about the house.

When I moved it and did a factory reset and new room correction they sounded great.Had to do another factory reset after I laid a folder on top of one while in use. (Would love to see a version with room correction app without factory reset.)As you can see in the photo they are in competition with a pair of play 5’s. Bet you would like to know which is better. Honestly, neither. They are very different in their audio reproduction design. Both are very worthy of their price point. I did decide to add a sub to the studios after comparing them to the play 5’s. Good base on the studio’s but not up to the Sonos. The amazon sub could use a user selectable crossover app, but all in all a bargain at the price.I switched from iTunes to amazon music several years ago. This recent purchase of the studios makes me even more pleased I did. I like the Sonos app a lot, but with amazon music I find myself saying “Alexa play some music”. She always plays something great tailored to my taste. She makes a better playlist than I could myself.My favorite listening environment was B&O pentas or my B&O RL 60’s back when turntables and cd was the source. Now that we have repaired the damage done to music with mp3 and have brought room correction to everyone we are in a whole new era.I can’t wait for the next step from amazon or Sonos. I believe at some point there will be floor standing speakers with room correction, matching amps for each driver and digital delay with room correcting software.Stereo pair Sonos play 5’s $1,000Stereo pair echo studios with echo sub  $530. Love both. Use studios most of the time.Amazon let me know when you build a pair of floor standing speakers. I’m in.\\t5\\tNovember 22, 2019\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",

I was amazed at the quality of the audio that came out of that little device almost comprable to Bose integration is exactly the same as the Gen 1 and Gen 2 it's very easy as long as you follow the directions the power cord I noticed is alot beefier for this one I would say it's almost double the size of the old one. How this differs is this is an actual circular power plug that being said you cannot hook this up to any USB device to power it like you could with the gen ones this does have a small quarter inch headphone jack to allow you to put speakers externally to it. I did notice this is much louder than the old generation 1 echoes and much clearer. And with Amazon offering them for around $25 I'm just going to say you're a fool if you don't purchase one they even make set up very easy if you choose to have them add it to your existing account. That being said all you have to do is connected to Wi-Fi and you're done. I would recommend purchasing the smart lights and smart outlets to use with this that's how I found the most use out of this device and I've been using this for years you can literally connect almost any smart device to the echo so that it can be voice controlled. I currently use this for lights in my house as well as outlets plus I have it control outdoor Christmas lights on a timer which is also hooked up to music through prime music that being said there is just an amazing amount of uses for this product and it seems like they just keep getting better and better and better. Because they invented this voice control I guess you could say I would stick with them over Google or any of the other companies that may provide these devices I have never been a huge Amazon fan but they have actually done something fantastic with these devices. I think at least every home should have at least one of them. And if privacy is your main concern don't worry laws are in place that prevent the company from snooping in on your private data.Amazon really doesn't want a billion dollar class action lawsuit on them so they take this seriously. I purchased one for my wife and will probably be purchasing a few more to send to my kids so they can enjoy the device as I have enjoyed it\\t5\\tDecember 14, 2019\\t1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\",\n",

There\\'s really only one issue...  The voice recognition is terrible!  To be more specific, Alexa can\\'t always translate what I say.I know how it works...  I say \"\"Alexa\"\" and wait for the beep.  Then, I say \"\"Shuffle songs by Post Malone\"\" (not that I would ever say that, but you get the idea.)  Anyway, then, Alexa sends that little soundbite of me talking to the Cloud where it gets translated into computer speak, the command is created, and is executed.  Alexa is just a fancy receiver for me to talk to and to talk to me.  However, the fact that an upload of my voice is required completely hamstrings the Auto experience.  If you\\'re driving, some places have better cell signals than others.  If I\\'m in an area with a poor signal, Alexa can\\'t even translate what I have to say, let alone actually execute it.  Thus, she sits there and does her blue light thing, and, then, just stops.  Nothing happens.Ultimately, Amazon, you need to build a better firmware that can do at least some translation without having to upload every little thing I say.  There are so many times when Alexa, essentially, can\\'t understand me, but I can open Amazon Music and start streaming to my Post Malone.  In the end, Alexa simply needs to be able to do some of her translating locally. That\\'s all there is to it.\"\\t2\\tFebruary 19, 2020\\t0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t',\n",
