0	Echo 4th Gen	I wish we never purchased this I hate the alexa! It never works! You ask it to simply turn on the fire stick and nothing happens. I don't know if it's the Alexa or the fire stick but every single day I have to go and unplug my fire stick at least two to three times to get it to turn on. It never understands what you're saying. When you let it know that it's not working it doesn't try to fix. It's horrible they need to fix it. When I got Alexa back when it first came out she would answer all these questions she was fun now she hardly knows anything I don't know what they did to her but they made her very stupid.	1	October 25, 2022	0
1	Echo 4th Gen	"Cons: it cannot Cast audio from my phone, does not work with Spotify app, Alexa app is incomprehensible, it shouts ""Now commented to XYZ!"" every time it connects to a device, it keeps flashing colors all day and night with no clear way to stop it, and setting up home theater pairing is bizarrely overcomplicated in the app.Pros: It pairs with the Fire Stick for a home theater setup and works perfectly. Alexa voice recognition is great. Audio quality is great."	2	October 25, 2022	0
2	Echo 4th Gen	Love this Echo. It is bigger than expected but it works great in our living room space. We have it so the kids are able to listen to music while they play games. I am able to set timers easily and the ease of allowing my kids to talk to Alexa is great. The only negative is there is no time display on this echo. It was easy to set up (as I have other Alexas/Echo) but other than that it was easy to install and set up. Had it playing my music within 3 mins of plugging it in.	4	October 25, 2022	1
3	Echo 4th Gen	First off I would give this premium sound echo 5 stars except the first one worked about 10 min before dying. Had to call Amazon on a Friday to arrange for return which was painless but….. The replacement arrived on Monday. The new echo premium sound really does kick. We also bought the battery stand so we could take it outside. This new combo is so great, just hope it lasts as long as our earlier versions.	4	October 25, 2022	1
4	Echo 4th Gen	Hubiera dado mejor puntuación si hubiera podido comprarlo en Amazon.  Aún siendo un producto de ustedes, para Puerto Rico nunca estuvo disponible para comprar y tuve que comprarlo en BestBuy.	4	October 24, 2022	1
5	Echo 4th Gen	"This is my second unit. The size is larger than ""a dot"". But, it also gives a richer bass sound than my other cylindrical shaped unit. When I set it up, it recognized the other unit in my home and designated itself #2. There are only 4 buttons imprinted onto the cover, + and- volume, turn on/ microphone and a third button that I don't yet know all's it's capabilities. The unit is in my basement workshop, which can be dusty. This is an issue since the entire cover is a black foam material which will hold dust. So, when I leave, I cover it with a small piece of plastic. The price was right, so I am happy with the system"	5	October 24, 2022	1
6	Echo 4th Gen	I live with this device everyday.  Was way better than I expected.  My friend came in and heard it and took it he liked it so much so I had to buy another one for me.  The sound quality is better than my bose unit.	5	October 24, 2022	1
7	Echo 4th Gen	1-year update and I have to say that this product is very inconsistent.  I mostly use this for listening to music.  Some days it will play perfect for hours.  Then the next day I can't get it to play a whole song without cutting out.  Unplug, restart, and it does it more.  Then Alexa doesn't respond correctly to audio commands.  I'm just about done with this junk.  It's an audio speaker and it can barely do that on it's best day.  Pair the subwoofer with it and multiply your headaches!!!  Sometimes it works, other times it don't... and then on the rare occasion, the SUBWOOFER will play music when the speaker won't.  VERY annoying!!!	1	October 24, 2022	0
8	Echo 4th Gen	It's a great upgrade from the echo	5	October 24, 2022	1
9	Echo 4th Gen	I Love this device! I was skeptical it would be helpful.  I got a deal on smart plugs and paired it with the Alexa Orb🤣 now we love playing music, cutting on lights throughout house, televisions, fans. We are old and not techy so this was a stretch for us. It’s SO easy to set-up and so useful I don’t know why I waited so long or how I got along without it. You will NOT be sorry you purchased. Buy smart plugs to to add to all your outlets. Cut on lights before you get home. LOVE it!	5	October 24, 2022	1
10	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa works fine as just alexa, but it won't integrate with my Smart TV.	4	October 24, 2022	1
11	Echo 4th Gen	Muy bueno y practico	5	October 24, 2022	1
12	Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded my old Amazon Echo to the new Echo, 4th generation.  I love the new design, choice of colors, and the ease of setting it up.  The sound quality is much improved, it is so good.  I'm glad I upgraded!	5	October 24, 2022	1
13	Echo 4th Gen	As I get older Alexa is very helpful to me and my wife to light areas that help in our safety and comfort.	5	October 24, 2022	1

16	Echo 4th Gen	Love this generation ~ they just get better and better.  Super clear and superior sound quality.	5	October 24, 2022	1
17	Echo 4th Gen	La recomiendo	5	October 24, 2022	1
18	Echo 4th Gen	It works great as a simple Echo Dot, when it becomes to usability of the speaker capabilities it becomes almost impossible to use it, it change the volume by itself constantly, it keeps disconnecting, I contacted Amazon support and I spent an hour trying to solve the issues with no success, I need to highlight, the support team where very kind and they really tried to help.	2	October 24, 2022	0
19	Echo 4th Gen	Perfect size, GREAT SOUND, the 4th Generation Echo is a must own ! They are a great addition to any and every room of your home!	5	October 24, 2022	1
20	Echo 4th Gen	Very helpful with my questions, information on current situations. Has a answer for everything question.	5	October 23, 2022	1
21	Echo 4th Gen	The learning curve for me was learning how to talk correctly to Alexa to achieve expected results is ongoing.  You speak correctly = you get your results, but until you say it the way Alexa will recognise it = frustration.  However, all in all, yes I would recommend and if gifting,  make sure the person receiving has a lot of patience.  I do see the benifits associated with having an Echo once the learning curve has been navigated.  Hope this helps someone.	5	October 23, 2022	1

23	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this Echo device for my living room/kitchen and did not want to bother with external speakers (line out or Bluetooth).  This echo sounds so good my wife thought that I had connected it to our 2.1 speakers.Got it on sale, and well worth the price.	5	October 23, 2022	1
24	Echo 4th Gen	Great quality speaker and looks nice  in any room	5	October 23, 2022	1
25	Echo 4th Gen	Nice clear sound	5	October 22, 2022	1
26	Echo 4th Gen	Maybe Amazon does it on purpose.  Bought the original Echo Plus years ago and, boy, did it get used in this family of nine.  Daughter mentioned it was finally showing its age (like me) so I got the newer one, plugged it in and that was it.  I plugged it in.  It automatically connected to Wifi and our Prime account and found all the other devices and kind of shooed me away when I was waiting to see what would happen.  Same with smart plugs.  Had an old Wemo and plugged it in and ran into all kinds of problems and instructions just to get it working with the Wemo app much less Alexa.  Swapped the Wemo plug with an Amazon plug and that's all it took.  Immediately showed up in my Alexa app.Yep.They're doing it on purpose.	5	October 22, 2022	1
27	Echo 4th Gen	The size is ok.  The sound is very good for the size.	5	October 22, 2022	1
28	Echo 4th Gen	"I found it difficult (during setup) to introduce this device (Echo Dot, 4th generation) to the three other ""dots"" (earlier version) for communicating ... I could ""drop in"" to the other dots (earlier version ""hockey pucks""), however, they (""bedroom, family room, garage, etc.) COULD NOT drop-in to Dot, 4the generation.  Technical help by phone resolved the issue, but I could not find any direction on how to fix this problem with any (text) documents and/or information on-line. Thanks to Emman F for his assistance."	3	October 22, 2022	1
29	Echo 4th Gen	This model sounds better then the one without premium sound.	5	October 22, 2022	1

31	Echo 4th Gen	I thought it would be a little better sound (But WOW),It was worth the money.	5	October 22, 2022	1
32	Echo 4th Gen	Bought this gem on Prime Day at a discount.  Even at full price this is worth it.  Great sound for such a small system.  Looking forward to integrating with the subwoofer.	5	October 22, 2022	1
33	Echo 4th Gen	Our Echo is incredible...my Mother loves it...almost every day when I get home from work she is listening to music....that makes me so happy.	5	October 21, 2022	1
34	Echo 4th Gen	Great product, good sound, nice design.	5	October 21, 2022	1
35	Echo 4th Gen	If you connect a device to the Echo for bluetooth it YELLS at you when you open anything that uses audio and it has heard anything for 10 minutes.  It is LOUD and there is NO WAY to turn it off.  This has been the same for years and they refuse to fix it.  So if you want to use this for bluetooth, you'll be wasting your money.  They Amazon programmers are apparently not smart enough to add this much desired feature of telling her to STOP YELLING AT ME.	1	October 21, 2022	0

37	Echo 4th Gen	The speaker sound is horrible. It sounds muffled, unclear and there are no sound adjustment controls for the speaker. .  Unbelievably, my 1ST GEN Alexa has great sound. I wish I could buy another.	3	October 21, 2022	1

42	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound from a small speaker.	5	October 21, 2022	1
43	Echo 4th Gen	Not enough of a difference from the $10 Echo Dot to warrrant the much higher price.  Good but not special.	3	October 21, 2022	1
44	Echo 4th Gen	I love the sound it was a upgrade from my old echo device. Much louder and does the same thing.	5	October 20, 2022	1
45	Echo 4th Gen	I bought two of these and connected them to my 4k Firestick for a home theater experience. They work and sound great! They are also great for playing Amazon music in stereo when you have 2.	5	October 20, 2022	1
46	Echo 4th Gen	The extra bass really makes the difference.	5	October 20, 2022	1
47	Echo 4th Gen	It works well.  I only have an issue with Tidal app compatibility.	5	October 20, 2022	1
48	Echo 4th Gen	Super cool. It's like having a live in assistant. Love love love	5	October 20, 2022	1
49	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this to replace an existing Echo solely for its ZigBee hub functionality.  I added 3 Zigbee light switches.  Adding was simple.  A few days later none of my light switches will respond to Alexa.  Unplugging the Echo Plus and plugging it back in gets the ZigBee light switches to reconnect but only temporarily.	1	October 19, 2022	0
50	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is wonderful, Alexa understands from far away what I'm saying. I now own 3 of these for all over the house. Always catch them on sale.	5	October 19, 2022	1
51	Echo 4th Gen	Very easy setup. Had an issue connecting one echo and they quickly sent a new one overnight. Works perfectly. The only issue I have is with Amazon music integration. Very unclear how to pair Amazon music with echo atleast for me it’s not working	5	October 19, 2022	1
52	Echo 4th Gen	Easy to install.  Fun to have.  We use it everyday	5	October 19, 2022	1

55	Echo 4th Gen	So far, so good	5	October 18, 2022	1
56	Echo 4th Gen	I was looking for a great sounding Echo and this fits my needs.  I couldn't afford the Studio so this was next after my research. What a great sound this has! Made a list of songs to test sound including my rock, classical, John Williams, Enya..all different depths of music. This Echo is a great product.  Highly recommended.	5	October 18, 2022	1
57	Echo 4th Gen	Me agrado todo	5	October 18, 2022	1
58	Echo 4th Gen	I will start off on a good note:  The sound is so much better than the previous generations.  However....As you can see there are two devices in the photo.  The one on the right is the original purchased, the one of the left was the used one I was sent to replace the one I am having problems with.  Clearly the replacement one was used, it has a small faded stain on it.  The issues I am experiencing involves the voice recognition.  I can say its name and it does not respond, sometimes I will have to raised my voice to a yell for it to hear me which does not work well when others are sleeping.  Other times, my older generation device in my bedroom responds and there is a wall between me and it.  I am sitting aprx 8-10 ft away from the device and it does not hear!  Sometimes when I ask it for my notifications, the one in the bedroom answers me thru the wall which of course I can't hear the notification!  They are going to send me a third one, due to the fact the replacement one I received was used.  Hopefully, the third time is the charm!  Aside from the issues with this particular device, I have always loved my Echo Dots.	3	October 17, 2022	1
59	Echo 4th Gen	Worth the money, easy to use, and a nice gift!	5	October 17, 2022	1
60	Echo 4th Gen	Speakers sound good for small as it is music sounds good playing on it	5	October 17, 2022	1
61	Echo 4th Gen	An intetesting improvement would be to add an additional set of Alexa response lights on top of the unit. This is not a complaint, just an observation.	5	October 17, 2022	1

67	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound!!	5	October 17, 2022	1
68	Echo 4th Gen	You will be repeating yourself alot to get this devices attention.  The sound quality is just about OK. The only positive I can find, is that I didn't pay full price for it	2	October 17, 2022	0

71	Echo 4th Gen	DON'T BUY until Amazon fixes this annoying, completely unnecessary stupid feature.	3	October 16, 2022	1
72	Echo 4th Gen	I've never liked Alexa, never registers any commands, if you want to listen to good music it just asks for subscriptions. Tried to pair a phone and it wouldn't pair. I e owned this since it came out. Finally stressed me out so much into the trash it went!	1	October 16, 2022	0

85	Echo 4th Gen	My little one likes cocomelon! But I don’t want to watch too much screen time! It is a good toy for her now! When she try to say hi, Alexa . Play cocomelon music please. It’s super cute!quit the iPad and TV for her!	5	October 14, 2022	1
86	Echo 4th Gen	When Amazon allowed grouping and pairing, we went crazy with Gen 3 Echoes through our whole house. We love them. So we decided to finally try the newest version in our kitchen. Overall, still great. But not as good as generation 3 units. First, don't worry about the directional speaker if you put these against a wall already. It still fills the room with sound. But here's what isn't as good: voice activation doesn't seem as tight as gen 3. I'm a composer and sound guy and while the low might be a bit better here over gen 3 but the rest of the sound just isn't as full as as the previous version. Gen3 is just a richer sound. Finally, and something I didn't see coming, the new shape. People can debate if they like it or not, but having it out for just a few days, and because the whole top is speaker mesh, you get finger prints from the buttons and dust and other air-gunk gets stuck on it and it can't be wiped away because, well, it's speaker mesh. This is going to be a big deal over time as this isn't going to look good in a year from now, where gen 3 could just be wiped off. I hope the next version abandons this current globe design, simply for this reason.	4	October 14, 2022	1
87	Echo 4th Gen	I have a couple more echo but this one is better than the others	5	October 14, 2022	1

90	Echo 4th Gen	Sound is everything that can be expected.	5	October 13, 2022	1
91	Echo 4th Gen	Bigger than 3rd gen echo, but good sound quality.  Connected easily to my Alexa network.  BUT, I cannot understand why they paired a black echo with a white power cord.  Was this a mistake, because it looks as if I am using the wrong cord.  Cannot use power cords for previous versions of Alexa/Echos.  Small, but extremely irritating issue.	3	October 13, 2022	1
92	Echo 4th Gen	I had an old 1st generation Amazon Speaker that wreaked havoc throughout the house (with the wife) trying to connect to a new wi-fi network. After hours/2days of frustration and feelings of failure, I contacted Customer Service whom in turn tried everything I'd been through already. I accepted defeat and the Customer Service Rep advised me to utilize the TRADE-IN on Amazon and UPGRADE. I received 25% off PLUS $25 gift card towards my new and MUCH IMPROVED Amazon Device. Needless to say, I'm overjoyed with the upgrade however, I remain pretty much in trouble with the wife :-)	5	October 13, 2022	1

97	Echo 4th Gen	When I saw premium sound I thought it would be loud like the echo show. Nonetheless it’s a quality product and has more bass than the echo dot	5	October 13, 2022	1
98	Echo 4th Gen	There have been times when it has been unreponsive...I've needed to do a hard reset before it will again function.It's louder than the Dot...but I find I want a unit with more volume to it.	4	October 12, 2022	1
99	Echo 4th Gen	I bought an entire Alexa speaker set-up (two echos, a sub, and an echo link) thinking I would use it as a home theater for both my TV and record player. It's an absolute nightmare to use. The speakers never connect correctly via wifi, the volume levels for the TV are too low, playing a record through the link works about 50% of the time. Unfortunately, I waited too long to return but I'll be selling these and buying a Sonos system.	1	October 11, 2022	0
100	Echo 4th Gen	I own 4 total devices and different generations.  Overall, Alexa works well until you to try to play music.  I have a playlist with at 300 artists in it; when I ask Alexa to shuffle that playlist, it hasn't chosen a new artist in over a year, and rarely a different song from that artist.I once shuffled 3x in a row and got the exact same song order all 3 times.  I am a premium amazon music subscriber, so it's very disappointing.	1	October 11, 2022	0

I tried to create a new group and the system just won't let me do it with new Echo. On it's own it ,plays fine ,music is great. Honestly the Dots should sound this good. So why won't it connect to my everywhere group,why does it turn to "" offline"" when I try to create a group ,but it's playing music? The whole idea is to have it play along with my other devices.Frustrating!"	4	October 11, 2022	1
104	Echo 4th Gen	i bought for a friend she loves it	5	October 11, 2022	1
105	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound. We bought one in white and one in charcoal to match things in our kitchen. Was surprised that the cord for the Alexa in charcoal is white. It should definitely be black. Notice in the ads where you show photos of all of them, that the white one is shown with the white cord and so is the twilight blue but the Charcoal 4th Gen Alexa is not shown with a cord at all, leaving the impression that the cord would certainly be black. Definitely do NOT like the white cord with the Charcoal Alexa. Wrong place to skimp - a bit deceiving.	4	October 11, 2022	1
106	Echo 4th Gen	Setting up the Echo 4 was very easy with integration of several smart devices in our home. Very user friendly and sound clarity is excellent.	5	October 11, 2022	1

112	Echo 4th Gen	Setup was a breeze. Voice recognition excellent. Sound quality dissapointing, somewhat muffled and could be clearer.	4	October 10, 2022	1
113	Echo 4th Gen	Years ago, I started with the Echo Dots.  The little hockey pucks.  Not used for music but for a virtual assistant, controlling smart lighting and also controlling my TV's Firestick that tunes over-the-air television through my Recast.  I loved it.  But then I got an Echo Show for the kitchen and I really enjoyed playing music on it while cooking.  The sound quality was ok.  Nothing to brag about.  Then I decided to upgrade my hockey pucks to the newer full size Echos.  I bought two Echos and placed one in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I would play music through them and the sound quality was very surprising.  So then I decided to get one more for the back porch.  That evolved into wanting another for the porch that I could pair to the other.That's when everything changed for me!  When you pair two of them together and set it up as a stereo pair; it is really amazing.  I sit outside now and I listen to music (in stereo!) on the porch.  The bass can be felt in my chair.  I'm so impressed.  I have 5 acres and with the volume turned up to 7, I can hear the music just about anywhere on my property.I plan on getting more Echos and enhancing the music when I listen to it inside the house.  I have the Bose 700 Soundbar and Subwoofer in my living room.  It sounds great for movies, TV and music.  But I prefer the Echos when listening to music.  Its perfect.  I can have Echos placed around the house and have music playing softly and you can hear it everywhere.I'm very impressed.	5	October 10, 2022	1
114	Echo 4th Gen	A este equipo si pudiera solo le diera 3.5 estrellas, pero esto no se puede.Este producto como pongo mas arriba esta rosando la perfección, pero... tiene un problema muy desagradable y es el siguiente, me he pedido dos echo 4ta para crear un cine en casa junto a un Fire TV 4K HDR, sucede lo siguiente: la calidad de audio directamente pedido a las bocinas via alexa es superior por mucho al audio que se reproduce desde el fire tv sincronizado con los echo 4ta, la musica suena hermosa, suena perfecta desde alexa, pero cuando veo una pelicula debo subir el volumen al maximo para apenas escuchar. sucede lo mismo si reproduzco musica en la app nativa de amazon music en el fire tv, el audio se siente de menor calidad a la que me ofrece cuando lo pido directo al asistente y tambien se siente que suena  menos.Estoy mas que satisfecho con la calidad de audio de estas bocinas cuando escucho musica desde Alexa, voy a comprar el echo sub de todos modos y esperemos que en futuras actualizaciones Amazon solucione este problema.	4	October 10, 2022	1
115	Echo 4th Gen	The sound is much better in this sphere-shaped version.  And now I don't need to spend as much time on the computer to find good songs to listen to.	5	October 9, 2022	1
116	Echo 4th Gen	I recently replaced an older Gen 1 (I think) Alexa on our back patio. The difference in the sound amazing. I just ordered a second one to replace my older on in my garage since it was 40% off.  It amazes me how they can get that could of sound through such a small device.	5	October 9, 2022	1
117	Echo 4th Gen	I like everything about the easy setup and operation. The tower looked better than the current configuration.	5	October 9, 2022	1
118	Echo 4th Gen	Excellent choice, highly recommended it, good piece of work	5	October 9, 2022	1
119	Echo 4th Gen	Replaced the old unit in order to have a built in hub	5	October 9, 2022	1
120	Echo 4th Gen	I’m still learning all it can do. I currently have used it to create grocery, Costco, other shopping list.	4	October 8, 2022	1
121	Echo 4th Gen	The main reason I bought this was for my husband. My husband has a hard time hearing when we use the TV built-in speakers especially when the show has music that is so loud it drowns out the voices. I hooked it up paired it through the Alexa app, and changed the preferred speakers to Echo, and still, the TV sound would not come out of the Echo. I called support and after she put me on hold several times, she came back and had me blue-tooth the Echo to the TV through the Settings menu. After that, the sound did come out of the Echo, but the sound quality is so quiet I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it, which made it still not as loud as the TV speakers. With the volume all the way up, Alexa is extremely loud. I called tech support again to ask if there is a way to turn down just Alexa's voice so it is not booming. There is not. One more note...Echo Alexa does not always understand commands. You have to say, Alexa, turn on FireTV...because if you say Turn on the TV, it just says that feature is not available...or something to that effect. Pretty awful. Returning it.	1	October 8, 2022	0
122	Echo 4th Gen	For whatever reason, this 4th gen can’t understand commands like my 3rd and 2nd gen Echoes. It’s almost worthless	2	October 8, 2022	0
123	Echo 4th Gen	The speaker quality is good but, the music intergaration is horrible you can't play the songs you want only from Spotify or Amazon, I use YouTube music so this product is useless to me, and I hate Spotify playlist	1	October 8, 2022	0
124	Echo 4th Gen	Very easy to install and get it up and working. Love the ability to turn lights on and off just by speaking. Ready to integrate more household items with Alexa. Clear speaking voice.  I haven't found anything, so far, that Alexa cannot answer!	5	October 8, 2022	1
125	Echo 4th Gen	This is our 3rd and worst Echo. Hasn’t heard voice commands on several occasions!	3	October 7, 2022	1
126	Echo 4th Gen	"I have a number of Echo ""dots"" but just the one large Echo. The sound quality of the dots is not really bad, but the sound quality of the large Echo is superior to the dots. Therefore, the large Echo is in the place where I play music most often (pretty much all day, most days). One of the dots is attached through the headphone jack to my stereo amplifier, that provides excellent sound in the downstairs and allows quick access to Alexa."	5	October 7, 2022	1
127	Echo 4th Gen	can't notice the bottom ring. It takes up way too much room in width. really ugly too.	3	October 7, 2022	1

131	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa is great but she responds to my TV which is somewhat annoying.	4	October 7, 2022	1
132	Echo 4th Gen	I would like Alexa to pair with more electronics and work as a Bluetooth speaker when the internet is out.	4	October 7, 2022	1
133	Echo 4th Gen	Bought this to replace my old Echo Dot.  The sound is richer and it is not too large to be obtrusive on my desk.  Deducted a couple of stars as it fails in the same place that my other Echo devices do, speech recognition and command execution.  I am a fan of the Echo/Alexa platform, and I expect it to improve, but as of now, it just isn’t as good as I want it to be.  Expect to spend a fair amount of time arguing with the device (trust me you will never win), and reviewing your voice history.  Keep the software up to date always as updates do bring improvements, although sometimes they seem to break things as well.  Seems we are all beta testers.	3	October 7, 2022	1
134	Echo 4th Gen	Voice recognition is so poor, my little echo dot picks up the commands before this device and is in another room!	2	October 7, 2022	0
135	Echo 4th Gen	Of course does Alexa well that’s a given.Sound quality is good pushing very good and almost impressive.  Amazon will be completing with the popular quality speakers soon.  In fact i will be adding the echo studio into the group.  If i had to buy again i would only get the studio.Easy to group two speakers but trying to figure out how to group multiple speakers or group as I decided to go all in on Amazon to build out my integrated sound system throughout the house including surround via the firestick .  Not sure this is the best plan but it is the most affordable and keeps the smart devices consistent to one brand for easy up keep .	5	October 7, 2022	1

144	Echo 4th Gen	"My original 1st Gen Alexa finally died after nearly 8 years. So traded in for this Echo 4th Gen. It is more expensive than the dots and supposedly better sound quality. But don't believe it; mine sucks. Sound is poor and muffled. When it plays music, music can barely be heard. When Echo is speaking, it is LOUD. Also, voice-recognition sucks. ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" Alexa: ""It is 7:04pm now."" And that is when it actually hears me (I have to SHOUT). After four generations, Amazon devices have gotten worse, not better. If you have to buy, stick with the dots."	2	October 5, 2022	0
145	Echo 4th Gen	Much better sound quality than the “puck.” This has replaced our radio and stereo and works great.	5	October 5, 2022	1
146	Echo 4th Gen	I bought my first echo3 on a deal and loved the functions it did to ease my life. It's the little things to turn on off lights, ask time and temp, play music, and most of all to read a book for me from my Amazon library. When echo4 had a deal I got it with lights for my granddaughter for music as it said improved speakers. That will be her birthday gift. I noticed then the newer echo4 with hub control for sale and upgraded. I put the older one in my kitchen as it still works great. I haven't a home full of Alexa enabled apps but I thought why not for a better quality sound. I haven't gone into the hub or ultrasound abilities yet but the sleep sounds I listen too at night is far improved. I like the look too. I did blue to keep them figured out if I get more for another room later. So far the only irritating thing is I have to repeat myself for Alexa to start playing something but it did that with echo3. I'm assuming it's the not perfect part of technology of humans. It improves each generation mayhap. Worth buy.	4	October 5, 2022	1

149	Echo 4th Gen	I absolutely love this and use it every day	5	October 5, 2022	1
150	Echo 4th Gen	I'm very pleased (low key obsessed) with this speaker. The sound quality is really good, especially for the price. I'm pleased to see the price went further down, almost seems irresponsible not to buy a whole bunch of them now. They love to work in tandem. One of them stopped listening to my commands at one point- Amazon replaced it with a new one no questions asked. I still haven't returned it, but they haven't really bothered me about it. It's still hooked up as a satellite speaker, but I think the Mic went out on it. Either way, I love it. I'm gonna buy a whole bunch more...	5	October 5, 2022	1
151	Echo 4th Gen	Absolutely never works properly. Can’t even pair to other Amazon devices. Just not made well.	1	October 5, 2022	0

153	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is on par with the best small WiFi or Bluetooth speakers. The voice and alex recognition is accurate. It look amazing with the decor. My advice is wait until prime day for best deal. You want be disappointed!	4	October 4, 2022	1
154	Echo 4th Gen	The sound is great, it has a great design, love the way it looks.	5	October 4, 2022	1
155	Echo 4th Gen	I use it outdoors but protected from the weather.  It has a nice clear sound and good volume.  Works well for connecting to a projector for outside movies too.	5	October 4, 2022	1
156	Echo 4th Gen	I exchanged a few old alexa devices for this one and paid a little extra for the sound. I'm honestly underwhelmed having hoped for more. I have alexa throughout my home and this didn't seem superior to the regular echo's or dot's I already have.	3	October 4, 2022	1

159	Echo 4th Gen	I was looking for a soundbar system for my livingroom. While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick. My Echo Sub arrived today, and I'm REALLY looking forward to trying that out.	4	October 3, 2022	1
160	Echo 4th Gen	These Echos worked well	4	October 3, 2022	1
161	Echo 4th Gen	One for my living room and one for the bathroom. Sound quality is great can’t complain as it’s good for any genre of music. I like the amazon music integration too.	5	October 3, 2022	1

165	Echo 4th Gen	I was a bit surprised at sound quality.	5	October 3, 2022	1
166	Echo 4th Gen	"I used to love these devices, but in the last year she's always adding at the end of every command i give her ""by the way ..."". I don't want to here her suggestions or tips or anything. I just want her to do what I asked her to do. I have followed every suggestion I can find on the internet and nothing works. Just tonight she was telling me she can get me ready for the rings of power. Amazon should not be advertising their things in my home like that. They should leave it on their Fire TV and website. I don't need to hear about it when I want to turn my lights off or set a timer. Never buying another amazon smart home device."	1	October 3, 2022	0
167	Echo 4th Gen	I love everything	5	October 3, 2022	1
168	Echo 4th Gen	I think amazon should just recall this device. Worst Alexa device ever. You have to call it 5 times before it even responds. Embarrassing for such a company. First gen echo dot is 100 times better. Sound is just louder but not better. Don’t waste your money. You will regret buying this product even on amazon day and at discounted price.	1	October 3, 2022	0
169	Echo 4th Gen	The sound is incredible.  Easy to pair.	5	October 2, 2022	1
170	Echo 4th Gen	I had a first generation Echo that I exchanged to get this new echo. To my disappointment this one doesn’t listen well AT ALL. The sound quality it top notch, but her voice recognition and listening is terribly sub par.I’ve used it in 3 different spaces and that has made little difference. The only time she responds consistently is when I’m within 4 feet or really yell.In fact, my two echo dots ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE respond more consistently to me than this one does. I was literally 10 feet away from this echo and asked it to set a timer and both of my other echos (which have walls and hallways between me and them) responded to me and the one that had a clear line of sight and sound, didn’t even engage.If you’re looking for excellent sound, this will get the job done. If you’re looking for another child that doesn’t listen and often misunderstands what you said, this will also get the job done.I’d get the smaller echo dot clock before I’d get this, if my mom or grandma were to ask my opinion.	1	October 2, 2022	0
171	Echo 4th Gen	Great product. It’s very fancy and smart. It’s worth every penny. It’s the center of my smart home. The sound is amazing.	5	October 2, 2022	1
172	Echo 4th Gen	Great price , very impressed with the sound quality.	5	October 2, 2022	1
173	Echo 4th Gen	The new 4th Generation Alexa had gone down in capabilities. The microphone is incapable of understanding your voice no matter how close you are to it. It's almost like she's lost half her IQ points. Keep your earlier generation! I've had to go back to using Siri. He's definitely the better answer here, but he doesn't often provide a verbal answer, but gives you links to them.	1	October 1, 2022	0
174	Echo 4th Gen	I'm an audiophile, but after a while even I long for the conveneience of 1-click settings. Enter Prime Deals and savings and I can't resist trying out the Echo 4th gen speaker in my bedroom.No, its not the same as my Sony 5.1 Stereo with live mic speaker balance testing. By the same token, I can carry it in one hand, talk (back) to it, and best of all, the sound quality is, especially for such a small (relativey) inexpensive speaker, absolutely EXCELLENT, and I say so without any hesitation.If you can, wait for a sale, but either way, if you want excellent sound the easy way, this is the way to go!	5	October 1, 2022	1

179	Echo 4th Gen	I like it’s sound, and I like the responses of the echo.  It is a vast improvement to the echo dot(2nd gen).It just seems much better all around.	4	October 1, 2022	1

183	Echo 4th Gen	See above	5	September 30, 2022	1
184	Echo 4th Gen	I was hoping that Alexa would integrate with my other home applications such as water heaters,  pool equipment etc and apparently this isn’t possible without some other equipment.  Alexa does integrate with the Ring doorbell security system as well as my TV.	4	September 30, 2022	1
185	Echo 4th Gen	Sound is quite good given its size. Plenty good for my office. I also have an Alexa Studio and THAT device is peerless and unmatched by any other. If you buy this, chances are you will be happy.	5	September 30, 2022	1
186	Echo 4th Gen	These little speakers really sound great.	5	September 30, 2022	1
187	Echo 4th Gen	The voice recognition isn’t the best. Has good sound quality for its size though.	4	September 30, 2022	1
188	Echo 4th Gen	when music is playing and you want Alexa to do something else it will sometimes not hear you at all. its like the echo has hearing loss whenever music is playing but as soon as music isnt playing it will head me say alexa from a different room.	5	September 29, 2022	1
189	Echo 4th Gen	"from the echo dot! Very happy with this unit. My main voice recognition complaint is she can't tell a squawking parrot from a dog, and when I am upstairs with the dog, resting silently, I'll get fone notices saying that the dog is barking, and would I like to drop in downstairs?  I've then asked her if she is guarding my house and she isn't. So no clue why I get constant notices! Now I won't believe her when she is guarding! I do like a new feature. With the loud parrots, I would call her name and she would flash her light, make an negative sound and stop responding. Yes, I have cussed at the AI when she didn't recognize my voice, and that is her default reaction to a cuss! But now, when I'm yelling across the room and the parrots then yell over me, instead if an AI version of a certain rude gesture, with light and sound and refusing to continue, she has learned manners. She politely says ""I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Could you repeat that?"". Much nicer. Again, the sound is way better than a single or pair of dots. More projection in  different directions. Works nicely with the music subscription. Like it so much, I'm considering rolling the dice on the $200 unit on Black Friday, to use in living room and putting this in my bedroom."	5	September 29, 2022	1

197	Echo 4th Gen	I was hoping this could be a cheaper solution for respectable surround sound for my house but the truth is that these are absolutely not the quality anyone would expect who is really looking to replace a sound system for easy plug n play wifi connected speakers. Yes they work, yes it is easy, NO these are not premium sound. Maybe they are premium in contrast to other echo devices but not comparable to other sound systems.You absolutely get what you pay for in this case…Cheap stuff yields cheap results.	2	September 28, 2022	0
198	Echo 4th Gen	So far I love the way this newer echo sounds compared to my original echo that I traded in. I'll admit that sometimes I do think that my older echo sounded better but it's probably just me missing the old look. This newer echo I think is trying too hard to look like an apple devices. I do love that this echo comes with a temperature sensor for detecting the room temperature although I do agree with other reviewers that it's not very accurate. Overall it does what it's supposed to do well even if the look leaves something to be desired.	5	September 28, 2022	1
199	Echo 4th Gen	It does what it is supposed to do as far as be an Alexa speaker.  The sound is lackluster and lacks any punch	3	September 28, 2022	1

202	Echo 4th Gen	Great product. Exceptional sound for its size. One suggestion, don’t place it too close to a security system glass breakage sensor. The base will set it off. Turn down the volume, move it or the sensor.	5	September 28, 2022	1

As soon as I hooked it up and played the very first song I was blown away by the sound! I love that you can adjust the levels in the Alexa app and she speaks much faster than the 1st generation. This unit is awesome and the color is pretty too. Great job Amazon 👏	5	September 25, 2022	1
225	Echo 4th Gen	I have owned several Amazon echos but this is the best one yet. I gave the sound quality a 5 and it is good when compared to other Amazon devices and general listening. Doesn’t replace your high quality stereo but it is a great product and works easily. Also setup was a breeze!	5	September 25, 2022	1
226	Echo 4th Gen	We like playing music while we sleep and the stereo speakers were giving out - used an older Echo Dot and it worked, this one however has great sound with dual speakers built in - beautiful deep sound / very satisfying purchase	5	September 25, 2022	1
227	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa is the first & last person I speak to in the mornings & night. She sets my alarm, wakes me, plays sleep music & meditation music… I absolutely love her!	5	September 25, 2022	1
228	Echo 4th Gen	It works great. Love the sound of it compared to the Dot.	5	September 24, 2022	1
229	Echo 4th Gen	Nothing I really like and Connecting and voice recognition are horrible big mistake I should of kept the older model. A hassle to set up	1	September 24, 2022	0
230	Echo 4th Gen	The sound from the Dot to this is night and day.  I still like my Dot in the bathrooms and have one connected to my Sound System in my bar. But, this baby I take on the deck with me ! The bass is nice and warm. It’s not a blaster, but the sound quality is there. I don’t crank it all the way up out of respect to my neighbors.	5	September 24, 2022	1
231	Echo 4th Gen	Working on trying to sync in all rooms.  Fantastic sound and look.  Would be nice to have the time and day feature.	5	September 24, 2022	1
232	Echo 4th Gen	Works fine!	5	September 24, 2022	1
233	Echo 4th Gen	The voice recognition really isn't very good on this. Alexa uses terminology when she speaks but when you ask about the same terminology she doesn't understand. The sound is okay for one speaker. Our Echo started playing intermittent static really loud during music. Also we kept getting Amazon ads that could not be turned off. Even customers service could not figure it out.	1	September 24, 2022	0
234	Echo 4th Gen	Hi	4	September 24, 2022	1
235	Echo 4th Gen	Mostly just turning lights on and off now. Radio works well and sounds very nice. Still learning how else Alexa can help around the house. An issue to us is the placement of Alexa. It is now in our bedroom to allow voice control of our bedroom lights. It has to be in our bedroom to accomplish this, but we also like to use it in our Kitchen to control appliances and such there. Apparently, another Alexa device placed in the kitchen is needed and connected to the bedroom Alexa so normal level voice can control all from anywhere in the home. We are deciding how to do this inexpensively. Should have done this planning ahead of time.	5	September 23, 2022	1
236	Echo 4th Gen	It is remarkable how small and powerful this echo is. The sound is very good and fills the living space nicely. With a little tuning, it is possible to dial in the perfect settings for best audio performance. Further more, the device is well built and feels solid without being too obtrusive, I wish only the cable would come in black.	5	September 23, 2022	1
237	Echo 4th Gen	It's an Alexa, everything you expect but with good sound quality.  I fills two rooms with music without issue.	5	September 23, 2022	1
238	Echo 4th Gen	Sound is good. Have to spend additional $15 to get a black cord for my black echo. Thanks Amazon. A choice between cord color or simply defaulting to a matching color cord would be appreciated.	4	September 23, 2022	1
239	Echo 4th Gen	Love it!!! Works great	5	September 23, 2022	1
240	Echo 4th Gen	I should not have upgraded. The sound is wonderful, but the new Echo struggles with hearing. We now use it more as a blue tooth speaker.Updated: I was contacted by Amazon and shown how to reset the Echo. It is working much better now! Thanks Stephanie!	4	September 23, 2022	1
241	Echo 4th Gen	To start i'll say that the sound quality is better than the small dot but not great by any means. The voice recognition is absolutely horrible. I can stand right next to it and it is a 50/50 shot if it will react when i give a voice command. Now i use it to control an echo link and when you pause and tell it to resume then it isn't even smart enough to go back to the same source that it was playing from prior to pausing. Amazon products are starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth and this is no exception. Save your money.	1	September 23, 2022	0

245	Echo 4th Gen	She has a fabulous speaker and is great to listen to music on this. I ask general questions right now and she is quick to come back with answers. Once I said thank you and she responded that she appreciates me being polite 😊	5	September 22, 2022	1
246	Echo 4th Gen	Love my Alexa. Easy to set up and controls all my smart devices	5	September 22, 2022	1
247	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound!!!	5	September 22, 2022	1
248	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa responds quickly and accurately to instructions.  The music selection and quality is great.	5	September 22, 2022	1
249	Echo 4th Gen	Very enjoyable	5	September 22, 2022	1
250	Echo 4th Gen	Works really well.	5	September 22, 2022	1
251	Echo 4th Gen	"I have had this Echo for over a year now. The sound quality is great and I think each generation gets better. However, the 4th generation microphones can't hear most of the time. I've tried multiple different locations to see if that would help and always get the same results. My 3rd generation Echo dots in other rooms respond before this one will. Once, the Echo finally responds after saying ""Alexa"" 2 or 3 times it then doesn't hear my request so then I have to start all over again. Alexa...silence.. Alexa again...still silent.. Alexa one more time...hey finally a response! Sound a bit to familiar? This must be the teenager version of the Echo...lol! All in all it's a great sounding speaker I just wished it could hear better."	3	September 22, 2022	1
252	Echo 4th Gen	Update: the Echo is making the hell demon noises almost every other day now. Reaching out to customer service.I love this Echo. But this echo sounded like hell demons were in my kitchen at 2am last night. Woke us up from a sound sleep. The loudest, creepiest, hell demon-esq almost static sound went off every 30 seconds bringing me to think we were finally under attack by another planet, Terrified of what this noise could be. After getting the courage to hunt down this god forsaken sound in my house in the middle of the night, we head into the kitchen where Alexa makes one last demon noise before detecting our movement, gives a little flash of light and stops.After researching this I guess is a known problem and rare. I still love her, but she’s unplugged at night now!	5	September 22, 2022	1
253	Echo 4th Gen	I have about 4 echo dots and I just really wanted to try the regular one. So for prime day i jumped on this and wow 🤩 the difference between the echo dot and this Echo is astronomical.The Echo Dot surprised me with how much bass it has for the size of the speaker. This echo blows me away The bass sounds clear and surprisingly strong for such a little speaker. Honestly, I feel like it would put some of my bookshelf speakers to shame that cost just as much or more and require a separate amplifier for power.I really feel like the biggest drawback is the microphone… No I’m not saying it is any worse than the echo dot but it certainly isn’t better. Sometimes I feel like you can’t hear me as I scream, Alexaaaaa! and other times it will randomly pop up as I’m whispering something similar.Overall, especially if you get it on a deal this is a fantastic Speaker. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in having higher Fidelity audio, but doesn’t want to jump for an audio file system. Bang for buck I don’t think that you can do much better than the echo. I’m very much considering getting a second possibly third or fourth.	5	September 21, 2022	1
254	Echo 4th Gen	"Although it is much larger than my old Echo Dot,  the voice clarity is not nearly as good.  It sounds 'muffled"" Also, at times, it has difficulty in understanding me."	3	September 21, 2022	1
255	Echo 4th Gen	Not crazy about the sound.  Not as good as the older tower style. It also drops connect with web more often. I also noticed it doesn't hear as well and I have to repeat my alexa commands.	3	September 21, 2022	1
256	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is amazing. Using it for surround sound in the garage. Highly recommend!	5	September 21, 2022	1
257	Echo 4th Gen	I am OK with the appearance, though the round ball like profile is too overwhelming, I much prefer the Echo dot. My first complaint is that the newer ball shaped device take more space, LOTS more space. and my MAIN complaint is that Alexa 4gen keeps loosing wifi connections and I need to jump through hoops to get it to reconnect. Sounds like I am a winner, and I may be. Take into consideration that I have limited mobility and un plugging and re-plugging back in the modem, router and ECHO and then accessing the app in my phone to reconnect is just a pain in the ass. I would like to return the ball for a dot, but I doubt that is going to happen. thank you.	3	September 21, 2022	1

259	Echo 4th Gen	Works very well	5	September 21, 2022	1
260	Echo 4th Gen	I like that it's loud when I listen to my music. What I don't like is when the Alexa is not able to hear me or understand and it glyches out sometimes.	3	September 21, 2022	1
261	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is excellent. Really like the shape!	5	September 20, 2022	1

263	Echo 4th Gen	Every request fulfilled by this horrible box comes with an added request from the box.What's the weather?It's 65 degress outside.  *Do you also want to know the humidity?*What time is it?It's 9 am.  *By the way, I can also set timers and alarms.  Would you like to try that now?*Every.  Single. Request. Comes with an additional comment, question or suggestion.  I can't get this thing to do what it used to do when I bought it... Answer simple questions without adding interruptions.  I now own an obnoxious paperweight.Do not buy any Amazon product.  There are always strings attached.	1	September 20, 2022	0

265	Echo 4th Gen	Great addition to the kitchen, the wife loves listening to her spotify playlist!	4	September 20, 2022	1
266	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa works great but the sound honestly sounds like it is being played from a hollow drum. Not crisp and no bass. Mediocre at best.	3	September 20, 2022	1
267	Echo 4th Gen	I do not like the sound quality. I get richer, clear sound with a $15 Bluetooth speaker. As for Alexa integration: it’s a useful as the Dot but getting it to work with SmartLiving isn’t going at all. It’s not very inclusive. Sooo, out of step with society. C’mon, Bezos! Get a better design team	3	September 20, 2022	1

270	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa is very useful won't replace Jarvis ,yet but someday soon. That said if you are purchasing this to be part of a Home security (RING). See my review of Ring in google.com	5	September 19, 2022	1
271	Echo 4th Gen	"When you buy this product it's weight and circular design makes it not stable at all. It does have a screw in adapter on the bottom that some sort of stand can be inserted but associate did not mention nor was there anything written on the box it comes in to let you know and no ""stands"" near product to sell. Alexa at times does not get right response from your requests and has already fallen twice off a chair when using outside."	2	September 19, 2022	0

276	Echo 4th Gen	This thing bumps for such a little speaker. It's comparable to my JBL charge. I use it during home improvements, and I couldn't be happier.	5	September 18, 2022	1

279	Echo 4th Gen	I have one, bought for a present,  they can't say enough good things. I have had Alexa/Echo for years. Just replaced my first a few months ago. I love it, makes my day, week, year!!!	5	September 18, 2022	1
280	Echo 4th Gen	Works well	5	September 18, 2022	1
281	Echo 4th Gen	"I got this to replace my 2rd Gen Echo tower IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATION.  This new device is much worse for listening comprehension, and I must repeat everything loudly and slowly several times before she gets it.  The 'deafness' is extremely frustrating.  I wish that I had kept the 2rd Gen Echo which has the ""far-field voice recognition"" with the ""array of seven microphones tucked under the light ring"".  The 4th gen cuts microphones down to only four and moved their location.  It seems Amazon sacrificed hearing comprehension to give better sound quality.  I say they sacrificed too much.  Premium sound isn't any good if the device can't understand you.  I really hate this device."	2	September 18, 2022	0
282	Echo 4th Gen	The new Alexa listens much better than the earlier generations.	4	September 18, 2022	1

285	Echo 4th Gen	An amazing device.  Turned her on about a year and a half ago….. and it’s never been off since.  BUT!!!!  All of a sudden the base speakers are rattling.  Very distorted sound (Sounds like a blown speaker does).  HELP!?!?  I love my echo	5	September 18, 2022	1
286	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this as a gift for my mom.  She keeps having to unplug it because it just randomly starts making a loud static noise.  Has anyone else had this issue??	2	September 18, 2022	0
287	Echo 4th Gen	I had did some research and had read where others were having problems with sound lvls and recommended others to get the white version, but I really wanted the black because it matches my living room. So I went with this one  . It was a little more expensive but the audio is very good for such a small device. Was very impressed and very pleased.	5	September 17, 2022	1
288	Echo 4th Gen	Works just fine. No whew screen, but did not need or want one.	4	September 17, 2022	1
289	Echo 4th Gen	"This is not a premium speaker by any stretch of the imagination. The microphone is not good at all. It takes a few shouts to get it to know I'm speaking to it, and then it doesn't hear any of us clearly (our shopping list os now a guessing game) **And the fact that Amazon CALLED MY HOUSE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT without warning and sent me an email to ""talk about my review"" was very off-putting to say the least."	2	September 17, 2022	0

291	Echo 4th Gen	nice unit, no complaints.	4	September 17, 2022	1
292	Echo 4th Gen	I traded in a 1st generation Echo.  Setting up this new Echo was simple and trouble free.  It was a trivial matter to reset existing routines to this new Echo using the Alexa app.  The sound of the 1st generation Echo was great, but music is even better on this Echo.	5	September 17, 2022	1
293	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound quality but this echo is worse at waking up on the command word than previous generations.The new inside temperature feature is cool but is often wrong (by 10+ degrees) so is somewhat unreliable.	3	September 17, 2022	1
294	Echo 4th Gen	Better base response than the previous generation. Voice recognition is equal in my opinion but overall better device.	4	September 17, 2022	1
295	Echo 4th Gen	We purchased this as a replacement to an echo dot. Huge difference on the sound quality. The music & voice recognition is superior.	5	September 17, 2022	1

300	Echo 4th Gen	I was at a friends house and he had one. I was impressed with the sound. So, I bought one and I just loved it.  In addition to the music, it will create a to do list for you. All you have to do is: Hey Alexa, add  [insert whatever you need a reminder of].	5	September 16, 2022	1

311	Echo 4th Gen	The sound and motion recognition are two nice upgrades.	5	September 15, 2022	1
312	Echo 4th Gen	Our Echo has been great! My only complaint is that when we ask it to play a song, it will sometimes talk over the song to tell us something else that we can ask it to do. Other than this, it has been very helpful.	4	September 15, 2022	1
313	Echo 4th Gen	A lot of sound for a small speaker. Absolutely love it. Must buy!	5	September 15, 2022	1
314	Echo 4th Gen	So I ask Alexa to play lullabies to go to sleep with my baby. Why does Alexa play one song, then turn up the volume to 200% and blast some obnoxious ad and wake both of us up? Now baby won't go to sleep.I used to love Alexa and use it throughout the day every day. The changes to the user experience over the last year to prioritize ads and increase frustration have made it unbearable and it will be going in the trash.	1	September 15, 2022	0

317	Echo 4th Gen	This Alexa worked ok for about 10 months, now a year later it’s either dead some days or dying, it will not pair with our echo dot that is literally 11 ft away and as of a few months ago (a week after the return date expires) we get the response to a request “I’m sorry I didn’t get that” every other day.  It has started making a very loud static noise which interrupts whatever it is the thing is trying to rate.  I have rebooted our internet and the device multiple times to no avail.  Very disappointing Amazon.	3	September 14, 2022	1
318	Echo 4th Gen	It is everything I thought it would be and more.  Love the sound.	5	September 14, 2022	1

323	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is great but then you have to deal with the constant pestering for you to upgrade to the premium package to enjoy more music. It seems every time I start to enjoy the sound quality of the device I'll ask it to play something else and it'll either tell me that song is only on the premium package and would I like to upgrade now to hear that song or I can hear the song but before I do I get asked again if I would like to get the premium package blah blah blah blah. Anyways good sound until you have to hear what alexa or what ever name you choose for your device has to say about blah blah blah.	2	September 14, 2022	0

330	Echo 4th Gen	"I have a long story about my problems with Echo.  I had a 3rd Gen Echo which worked fine for my application in a Finished Basement used for music listening since 2021.  I had it connected / paired to 3 external BT devices : an IOTA Stereo preamp / amp stack; a Denon AV Receiver and a pair of JBL BT Speakers [Charge 3].  I would be able to select one of these devices to play Streamed music via the ECHO as the source and selector.  Suddenly on or about March 26, 2022 as I turned on the IOTA and asked Alexa to play Spotify, there was problem.  Same with the Denon and the JBL speakers.  As i checked the Alexa App to see if the devices remained paired on the list, they were listed but would not play.  I tried many measures (rebooting the Echo, Resetting the Echo , deleting and re-installing the Alexa App, Restarting my Verizon Router to no avail.  When I went to the App, looking to recognize and pair to the devices- the Echo would not recognize nor pair.  That required the first contact with Amazon Agents via Chatting.  The agent had me go through all the aforementioned steps again including Unplugging the Echo.  Nothing worked.  The agent said it must be the Echo unit itself.  Send it back to Them - it is out of Warranty due to its age, I was required to purchase a new 4th gen Echo (after many emails I was able to get a Discount of 25% on the purchase).  I received the 1st of the new 4th Gen Echos the following week.  I set it up as soon as I received it, and it did recognize and pair to my BT devices, play streamed music, but however, when I asked to play music without BT connections, the Echo would start up, then utter the words:  ""Sorry, That Device is Off Line"".  The frustration was increasing and the issue was perplexing.  Some light was shed when I went on Amazon's Community Forum under Devices in the Customer Service menu on their web site.  I posted my problem and received some many similar responses.  I use a Android based phone - Google Pixel 4XL - one poster's repsonse said that he had the same experience in the sudden mode - but not when using his wife's Apple iPhone !!  He suspected it was IT glitch in the Android / Amazon software.  After numerous phone call, Chats, and emails,  and more Posts to Amazon's Community Forum, finally a Supervisor (Mike , I think was his name),  contacted me and confirmed hat this issue was World Wide.  Then as suddenly as it stopped working, and without advance not from Amazon, sometime in May, the ECHO worked - it paired to the BT devices and played fime without problems that I cited!!  Then sometime therefater, the issue of Sorry, That Device is Off Line returned, but only when asking Alexa to play the Music from the Echo w/o BT connections.  More calls / chats and was asked to send that Echo back for a replacement. The replacement unit received in June (?), played fine when first connected and set up, but then after a few weeks, it happened again!!  That 2nd replacement unit was returned and the 3rd unit was received.  The same thing occurs despite the assurance form the agnt that this has the ""newest software and the problem is resolved"".  He was wrong !!  The 3rd replacement unit repeated the same issue.  I decided to send that 3rd unit back, got my full credit of $109 and ordered a new Echo Dot / with Clock.  That unit played fine until the other day - Same thing occured, when asking to play music from the Echo Dot (which recognizes and plays fine with any BT connection), it spews the same :  Sorry, That Device is Off Line"". I just learned that ECHOs are discretely Updated in the background by Amazon without Notice.  But only 3rd Gens and upward.  That's why my older 2nd Gen Echo located in another room in the house works fine without issues , although it has never been used to connect to any BT devices.  My wife uses it to listen to iHeart radio broadcasts an would be really Upset if I rocked that Boat.Bottom line : No. 1  The new Echo Dot with Clock will probably become a gift to my son for his new house.  This too is curious because he has 2 older Dots and uses the same smartphone I do (Google Pixel) in his apartment.  He does not have these issues. He does have his echo connected to a BT TV speaker system.  But his wife uses an Apple iPhone.  But his Dots are older units !!  This issue, particularly after Amazon admitted earlier that this was a World Wide issue and the fact that the units start off fine buy then suddenly changes, leads me to the one conclusion of a Software Glitch with Security Upgrades being done behind the scenes, affecting Android users.No.2 - after getting the Dot, the sound quality vs the 4th gen Echo is far inferior.No.3 - I am gifting the new Dot to my son, and ordering a Used 2nd gen Echo from Amazon to see if the problem evades the older Echo units.  Amazon only Updates 3rd gen and Up units.  If this Used 2nd gen does the same thing, it will go back and I will do without Echo in that finished basement.  I can use my Smartphone via BT to play music vai the BT devices.I have posted all of this on The Amazon Community Forum seeking any other advice or information to shed more light on this ongoing issue - at least for me.  PS:  i rebooted my Router numerous times, it is fully updated.  I could  not find any information that could lead to a Router issue that could be causing this."	4	September 13, 2022	1

339	Echo 4th Gen	Very skeptical but VERY happy I purchased. I have a projector set up, have Fire TV and used Sonos pair for the speakers. It worked 70% of the time. Super frustrating that the connection was always Wi-Fi driven and not Bluetooth. When I heard you could connect Echo speakers to the Fire TV, I gave it a try. I got 1 for now and it’s perfect for the 14x14 room. Sound quality is great! I will probably add a 2nd one and put on the same side the Sonos were on but not needed. Worth the try!!	5	September 12, 2022	1
340	Echo 4th Gen	I purchased this alexa because our older echo plus died and we needed the zigby capability. I'm not a huge fan of the ball design that's going on and it's footprint is alittle bigger than I expected. But it does what it was designed for.	4	September 12, 2022	1

343	Echo 4th Gen	"I finally decided on my birthday gift to myself and after studying the features I decided on the 4th Generation with the Smart Hub. I also elected to get the one with a rechargeable base so I could easily move it from room to room.My favorite thing was when I asked Alexa why she didn't have a male voice and she immediately changed to a male voice!!!!  I used it a lot for reminders like ""Remind me in 10 minutes to let the dogs inside"" and ""Remind me in 30 minutes for Oven"" and many other reminders and appointments.  I used the alarms and love to wake up to music and to turn the TV on and off and etc.  I have already recommended this one to many of my friends and one has already bought the same one.  I have yet to pair it with the doorbell or other smart devices but I shall."	5	September 11, 2022	1
344	Echo 4th Gen	Highly recommend this thing, sound quality is phenomenal!!	5	September 11, 2022	1

347	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is very rich.	5	September 11, 2022	1
348	Echo 4th Gen	While echo works amazingly, I purchased echo to enhance my fire tv sound. I thought I was having technical issues because my TV speakers were disabled. I found out that both echo and Fire TV speakers do not work in unison. It’s one or the other. The home theater sound is amazing! And the TV definitely  sounds amazing with echo. Just was wanting to have both work together. Which is disappointing.	5	September 11, 2022	1
349	Echo 4th Gen	Does exactly what I need for it to do. Excellent job of recognizing commands and requests. Good at identifying individual voices for custom commands. Overall, much better than I expected. Sound quality is as good as can be expected from the size. Someday hope to try it with the subwoofer for my family room.	5	September 11, 2022	1
350	Echo 4th Gen	(Update):  Amazon Customer support acknowledged the defect and sent a replacement as the product was under warranty. The new one is working fine so far (day 1) ----I have owned echo since the 1st gen released.  This one is a significant regression when it comes to voice recognition.  Really feel pathetic trading in my first gen for this. Kids stopped using Alexa as they get frustrated that the device doesn't recognize their instructions as well as it did before. Even the echo dot I have upstairs perform better than these.  Amazon does not do a great job of support for the devices.  They did remote diagnostics, sw upgrade etc remotely and eventually said I need to send this for repair which could take anywhere up to 3 months.  Not worth the time and effort.	3	September 10, 2022	1
351	Echo 4th Gen	Only down fall is it has to be plugged in at all times to work.	4	September 10, 2022	1
352	Echo 4th Gen	I’m addicted to Alexa folks. I have an eco dot in every room. No more yelling through the house. I always have access to information. I have smart bulbs synced as well. She knows my voice and can hear me if I’m far away. I have 2 of these with the premium sound. They sound great! I play music all over the house from my phone and these premium speakers have great base for their size. It is easy to set up. The blue one is really pretty too. Makes a great gift!	5	September 10, 2022	1
353	Echo 4th Gen	Really good sound and voice recognition.	5	September 10, 2022	1
354	Echo 4th Gen	Cumplío con todas mis espectativas la recomiendo total mente	5	September 10, 2022	1
355	Echo 4th Gen	I've owned Echos since the original Echo Dot.  3rd Gen Echo had better microphone pickup I guess.  If it hears me at all while I'm facing away from the little gray ball of frustration it often gets what I say wrong.  Maybe it is a good thing that Alexa is losing her hearing in her old digital age.  At least I'm less worried about digital spying by Amazon.  Though it could just be a ploy.	2	September 10, 2022	0

357	Echo 4th Gen	"Let me start this off by saying.. this thing is monstrous. It is much bigger than any previous Echo I've had.I figured the ""superior"" sound was a good trade off for the size increase, but after playing the same songs on an Echo dot and this one, I noticed very very little difference (perhaps a more resounding bass).Needless to say, I had no where to place this comfortably and had to return it because it wasn't what it's chalked up to be."	3	September 9, 2022	1
358	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is bad	5	September 9, 2022	1
359	Echo 4th Gen	We can't link this to our other Alexas for the life of us! Too bad because it has a great sound!	4	September 9, 2022	1
360	Echo 4th Gen	Like the sound	5	September 9, 2022	1
361	Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded from a 2nd gen that I loved... Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me.  I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it.  The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible.  Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker.  I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me.  I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed.  Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me.  I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work.  There is definitely a flaw in the design or components.  Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues.  I am ready to throw this in the trash.***UPDATE: 10/5/22***Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me.  I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review.  They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones.  Why the reduction in microphones?  With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response,  and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond.  It is actually comical at this point.  I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond.  Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones.  I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing.  Huge disappointment for a great device.We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations.  By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time.  I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years.  2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio.  I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.	1	September 9, 2022	0

363	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality on this is incredible! I set it up next to my dad's $5,000 stereo system and we could barely tell the difference in the sound quality.I have 2 Echo Dots and was noticing it struggles with bass, especially at a high volume. This one keeps up just fine and sounds great. I have 2 in my open kitchen/dining/living room and it's an immersive sound experience.	5	September 8, 2022	1
364	Echo 4th Gen	Took me a few tries to get it up and running but it has a decent sound for such a small speaker could have had more bass for me but I’m satisfied I bought it for my guest room in case whoever was staying over could listen to music while there	4	September 8, 2022	1

374	Echo 4th Gen	I've been using the second generation echo and dot for many years. They were ok, but the sound wasn't very great. I took a chance and bought 2 of the new echos and what a difference. I've paired them with my older echos and dots and I love the sound throughout the house. Also they are much easier to navigate on the Alexa app.	5	September 6, 2022	1
375	Echo 4th Gen	This is by far the best, albeit the most expensive timer ever. I haven’t burned anything since I got her/it. I don’t hear very well so I have the volume on 10 and if I still don’t hear it my upstairs neighbor comes in to let me know. This maybe the start of a romance, or not.	5	September 6, 2022	1
376	Echo 4th Gen	Ease of use	5	September 6, 2022	1
377	Echo 4th Gen	I initially purchased two Echos.  I was so impressed with the sound I have since purchased an Echo Show for myself and one for a friend.  Super easy to install and set up.  The devices practically walk you through set up, step by step.  I'm a relatively old guy and even I found it very easy.  I would recommend getting The Echo Show first and then adding more speakers as needed.	5	September 6, 2022	1
378	Echo 4th Gen	My beef with this product is as follows:1) despite multiple people requesting it, Amazon refuses to create the ability to turn off Alexa saying “Now connected to [your name]’s” iPhone whenever you connect a device2) Alexa will randomly say something to you even though you didn’t give her a command. Super creepy that it’s always listening + has so many issues with thinking you gave her a command	2	September 6, 2022	0
379	Echo 4th Gen	The device itself is great, good sound. However Alexa‘s voice recognition software continues to get worse. it’s becoming more and more frustrating to deal with her.	3	September 6, 2022	1

381	Echo 4th Gen	"I feel like I'm a fanboy of Alexa. I have Echo dot 4th gen, Echo 4th gen and Echo Plus and I love the capabilities of this smart device and the sound quality.Yesterday though, I tried pairing all of the devices so they will play together, and after trying so many different things, I got 2 devices to work, but the Echo dot just can't connect to the other 2. Not as ""Alexa play everywhere"", and not by adding it to the group in the app.Alexa also acts strangely when she doesn't understand something and just bleeps something and shuts off. If I ask a long question, she'll cut me and start operating based on half of my sentence.She never was able to answer something that is relevant to the previous thing we talked about. For example: ""Alexa, what is the tallest building"" and she would tell me ""Burj Khalifa"", I'd ask ""And what is its height"" and she wouldn't know what is ""it"", she doesn't know we just spoke about the Burj Khalifa.The thing is that its been so many years already and it seems like there is no progress in her abilities and sometimes it's seems like she gotten worse through the years.I used to be able to play ""My sleep playlist from spotify"" but now she will always look for playlists made by Spotify instead of playing the playlists I created. Even if I'll name the playlist ""sleep by me"" or some other more specific name of a playlist that isn't public on Spotify, she'll say ""Sorry , I don't know a playlist called ""Sleep by me"" even though that is exactly the name, and she's connected to my Spotify user."	1	September 6, 2022	0

Easily paired to the Sub and a 65” Omni tv now I have the sick theater sound I wanted with the full Alexa voice control. Technology has come so far when I was a kid I was the remote for my parents now I just say Alexa. Update….dropped one star for issues with sound dropping occasionally.

The light ring on this model is on the bottom and depending on placement can be more easily hidden from view than the older models that had it on top.

429	Echo 4th Gen	I wouldn't buy any echo device again.  I have 4, one is this model. All of them are very glitchy about when they work. Sometimes alexa says it will play music and then nothing happens,  mostly it plays something completely different than what you say. It's so frustrating to have purchased something that works so terribly.  It got worse and worse as time goes on, I've had almost 2 months now and my window to return is over. I do not recommend purchasing an echo device.	2	September 1, 2022	0
430	Echo 4th Gen	"Amazon advertises that the Echo (4th generation) has a hub for Smart lights built in. It uses ZigBee connectivity. It does not work with Phillips smart lights according to Amazon technical support.  Amazon says that I need a Phillips Hue bridge and Alexa to control Phillips lights. The Phillips hue bridge I have is broken so I ordered  this Echo (4th generation) based on the advertising that this Echo has a built in hub. I need to return this device and buy a new Phillips Hue bridge. This has been a very stressful experience and I have lost faith in Amazon as a truthful source.Wait a minute: I just received a call from JJ Amazon support. He helped me set up my lights. He deserves a raise in pay. He patiently talked me through a very complicated procedure. There was also an error in a help file which stopped any further progress in the procedure. The error was in a direction that  said to follow the directions here.  The word ""here"" was in regular typeface not in blue or italicized. When I finally decided to click on the regular looking word  ""here"" the instructions took me to the next page and I was able to complete the procedure. JJ saved me from returning my ECHO (4th generation), from disappointment and anger. He also saved Amazon from losing a long time customer, Bravo JJ."	5	September 1, 2022	1

433	Echo 4th Gen	It’s been a great experience and the integration with all of my smart appliances have been exceptional. The sound quality is very good.	5	August 31, 2022	1
434	Echo 4th Gen	Sounds great! I have not taken the time to explore all it can do but happy with the little bit I use for music, weather and news right now.	5	August 31, 2022	1
435	Echo 4th Gen	I also have an Alexa tower upstairs and have tried to pair them so I can do the same things like; Alexa pay music by the Beatles but Echo (4th gen) tells me I need to add a program that would cost $9.95 a month.Am I doing something wrong?Your thoughts?Thank you,Randy	4	August 31, 2022	1
436	Echo 4th Gen	This devise is a replacement for a echo devise that is having connectivity issues. I hope the larger physical size will give me better audio (larger speaker) with more base.	5	August 31, 2022	1
437	Echo 4th Gen	Love it!!! The best one yet!!!	5	August 31, 2022	1
438	Echo 4th Gen	This was actually very easy to install.  Has really good sound and easily recognizes commands. Bigger than I anticipated.Haven't figured out if I can use the internal TV speakers but that's ok. I'm hooking up a sound bar also.The one thing I didn't care for was I ordered a black one which I got but the cord is white. Kind of tacky.	5	August 31, 2022	1
439	Echo 4th Gen	I had a 2nd generation Dot that always worked great, including easily picking up my voice commands at a normal speaking volume even with the TV or other noise in the background. Unfortunately the full size Echo drops the ball for hearing commands. I often have to repeat myself more than once, raise my voice, move closer to it, etc. to get to respond. I've tried new spots in the room all to no avail. Its quite frustrating given how great the Dot worked.Other than the poor mic, the sound is rich and full even at moderate volume. Set up was super easy, basically plug and play because Amazon had my account all ready to connect.	4	August 31, 2022	1
440	Echo 4th Gen	I have to say I didn't expect much, but the sound quality on this is way better than I expected I'm very impressed.Update - I have purchased a few more of these because I like them so much, continue to be impressed by the sound quality	5	August 31, 2022	1
441	Echo 4th Gen	Fue un regalo de mi novio y me ha encantado 😍😍😍😍	5	August 30, 2022	1

444	Echo 4th Gen	Buen sonido, a veces no me escucha pero no hay lío por eso, muy útil y el tamaño es perfecto.	5	August 30, 2022	1
445	Echo 4th Gen	The sound is amazing.	5	August 30, 2022	1
446	Echo 4th Gen	The echo 4th generation is wonderfully amazing and can literally do everything. Just for a test, we even asked it to do math, algebra, and equation solving.The sound is incredible with absolutely great fidelity. Having all the songs that are available through Amazon music is fantastic! We are able to hear all kinds, styles, and genres of music!We have not even begun to tap all the capabilities of the echo 4th generation. We will be learning things for a long time.We are extremely pleased with this unit!	5	August 30, 2022	1
447	Echo 4th Gen	I get to hear music I haven't heard for years	5	August 30, 2022	1

451	Echo 4th Gen	I love how alexa can be used for so many things in the home... shopping list,  reminders,  music, podcasts.  The sound is much better on this larger version.	5	August 30, 2022	1
452	Echo 4th Gen	After a long time finally, I managed to post a review about my echo. Its been almost eight months I am using this device.The build quality is very good, very robust. I really admire the fact that all the devices that are made by amazon has a super good build quality.If I navigate to the Sound of this device: I think, the quality of sound is more than decent, enough to fill you with quality music if you are inside around a room. I also use my echo as a speaker for my desktop computer, thanks to its 3.5 mm jack support.Voice assistance Alexa works great: using Alexa app it is very straightforward to integrate different devices/home appliances with echo to control them using voice command. But sometimes when there’s music playing loudly or noise around the echo: it struggles to listen to my command. Another issue I have encountered at times that echo respond very slow or don't respond at all against my command. It can happen for slow internet speed; I don’t know for sure.	4	August 29, 2022	1
453	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound with deep base.  Use it on our back porch when relaxing and chilling in the hot tub.	5	August 29, 2022	1
454	Echo 4th Gen	Recomendado	5	August 29, 2022	1
455	Echo 4th Gen	Sound and sensitivity are improved but am disappointed that it has no visual clock. Had wanted to use it in the bedroom at night but , without a clock, had to use it in a different room. Works well for all other functions.	4	August 29, 2022	1
456	Echo 4th Gen	Si me agrado mucho	5	August 29, 2022	1

460	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound from a small speaker	5	August 28, 2022	1
461	Echo 4th Gen	My husband and I have 2 of these. One in the living room and another one in the bedroom. The one in the bedroom I used to help me sleep. I was waking upA number of times durning the night. Decided to try Ocean sounds ( which are Ocean waves ). I have it going all night. Both my husband and I have noticed that we are sleeping for longer period of times and deeper. The Ocean waves have mediative quality to them. The sounds lulls me to sleeps. I also like the morning news I get, with a following pod cast on a top story. The quality of the sound is excellent. I think I will get another one for the living room and a subwoofer. But that is only to deepen the already deep sound this little device gives off.	5	August 28, 2022	1
462	Echo 4th Gen	Great product	5	August 28, 2022	1
463	Echo 4th Gen	Excellent Alexa, beautiful, and responds when I call its name.	5	August 28, 2022	1

473	Echo 4th Gen	works fine	4	August 27, 2022	1
474	Echo 4th Gen	Like overall. Keeps loosing the internet where the micro doesn't and it is further from source	3	August 27, 2022	1
475	Echo 4th Gen	I’m a bit disappointed with the Echo device. The sound is definitely an improvement compared to the previous models. The voice recognition does not work very well in my case in addition the echo moves on my desk because of vibrations when I play loud music	3	August 27, 2022	1
476	Echo 4th Gen	Cuando lo encendi todo funcionó muy bien, pero 2 horas más tarde luego de un sonido extraño cuando reproducía música dejo de funcionar, ya no enciende la luz ni responde, simplemente murió. Es dinero perdido ya que lo traje a mi país y aquí no hay garantía.	1	August 27, 2022	0

479	Echo 4th Gen	I love that the product is small but the sound is great	5	August 27, 2022	1
480	Echo 4th Gen	I'm impressed with how well this unit hears us. It's located in an addition, with a brick wall between it and the bedroom, but it hears us through that wall just fine, even when we speak at a relatively low volume.	5	August 27, 2022	1
481	Echo 4th Gen	lo maximo …súper espectacular…	5	August 27, 2022	1
482	Echo 4th Gen	La mejor bocina que he tenido	5	August 26, 2022	1
483	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is really good, I usually use it when I’m cleaning my house	5	August 26, 2022	1
484	Echo 4th Gen	I like the integration between app and voice recognition.	5	August 26, 2022	1
485	Echo 4th Gen	We have both an Alexa 4th gen. and an Alexa Dot 4th generation. Both units work well.	5	August 26, 2022	1
486	Echo 4th Gen	Voice recognition better than previous units. Quick setup with app. Sound is great. Looking forward to using internal zigbee hub for smart integration.	5	August 26, 2022	1
487	Echo 4th Gen	Very nice integration	5	August 26, 2022	1
488	Echo 4th Gen	We have 10 spread through out our house, love it	5	August 26, 2022	1
489	Echo 4th Gen	I have several 3rd and 4th gen Echo Dots and they sound pretty good for general use, but this thing is a beast! I wanted a Dot in my media room that could really rock while I'm gaming on the TV and this delivers. The woofer really pounds out the base notes. The bass is on par with my big Samsung 1.5' subwoofer cube that the TV uses.Alexa works perfectly, no different than my other dots. AND it also has motion and temp sensors! I haven't used the smart home hub built in because Alexa can control my devices without it.All-in-all, I'm very pleased with this thing although my neighbors might not be when I'm cranking some tunes during a game ;-)	5	August 26, 2022	1
0	Echo Dot	Muy buen producto	5	October 25, 2022	1
1	Echo Dot	I love Alexa Echo dot. She has a great range of music and and information. Great for mapping out your schedule, timers, mediation music and all types of playlist	5	October 25, 2022	1
2	Echo Dot	I dislike it doesn't do teaching like math, skills, but over all it's great	5	October 25, 2022	1
3	Echo Dot	Every day I try to use it and it says it can’t connect to “public Wi-Fi”. Only way to fix is to crawl under my desk and unplug it. At least they should have a reset button given how badly they are made.	1	October 25, 2022	0
4	Echo Dot	I was never a fun of the echo but I must admit I’m very impressed with echo I love it and suggest this for anyone.	5	October 25, 2022	1
5	Echo Dot	Love the way it responds so quickly to my voice	5	October 25, 2022	1
6	Echo Dot	I now have 4 echo dots in 4 different rooms. It was my preference not to link them together so that they can be used to listen to different items at the same time by other family members. I might have one set as a timer in the kitchen and music different music being played in the other rooms.	5	October 25, 2022	1
7	Echo Dot	Sounds great, listens perfectly to what I say, recognizes different people's voice,  weather updates, music, it's the best 30 bucks I ever spent	5	October 25, 2022	1
8	Echo Dot	If you love to listen to music through your Echo Dots then get a couple of extra 3rd generation dots. The sound quality on these is much better than the new versions. Not sure what happened, but we use these in the garage and around our property to play music.  Originally picked up a new 4th gen version thinking it would sound even better, but it actually sounded worse, really bad, tinny, and shallow when compared to the rich and fullness of the 3rd gen.  Not that these are supposed to be on par with Bose or Sonos, because they are not, but they are plenty good for small areas.  So if you plan to enjoy music then stick with the 3rd gen.	5	October 25, 2022	1
9	Echo Dot	It's fine.	5	October 25, 2022	1
10	Echo Dot	I bought a pair of these for setting up a basic smart home with voice control. I have that  pair in the living room and I’m adding one for  my bathroom/bedroom to share. My forth unit I will use to drive a subwoofer I have from my old home theater system which I have taken out. A patch cord from the Echo will have it’s output jack going into the crossover built into the subwoofer adding heavy bass to the limited Echo sound capabilities! I’ve gotten them on sale for less than $20 each and I consider that a fantastic deal for the functions they are capable of.	5	October 25, 2022	1
11	Echo Dot	The product is very useful in my Bedroom.	5	October 25, 2022	1
12	Echo Dot	A pesar de los años lo sigo usando como la primera vez.	5	October 25, 2022	1
13	Echo Dot	I like the fact that it is easy to communicate and get requested music.	5	October 24, 2022	1
14	Echo Dot	Definitely getting another one maybe 2 of these & replacing  the sphere-shaped one.	5	October 24, 2022	1
15	Echo Dot	Easy set up	5	October 24, 2022	1
16	Echo Dot	Great	5	October 24, 2022	1
17	Echo Dot	Works great for lights that I'm using it.for.	5	October 24, 2022	1
18	Echo Dot	We use two for stereo music from SiriusXM. Easy to start up, change chAnnels, and control volume all the while sitting and sipping wine.	5	October 24, 2022	1
19	Echo Dot	I got this for my bathroom so I could listen to music or news while getting ready for work.	5	October 24, 2022	1
20	Echo Dot	Thank you	5	October 24, 2022	1
21	Echo Dot	"For example, when I say ""Alexa, play my Liked Songs on Spotify"" or ""Alexa, play the most recent liked song on Spotify"" she'll turn on the shuffle and not play it from the most recent liked song, I'd have to manually put it. Overall, not a huge thing but a bothersome thing."	3	October 24, 2022	1
22	Echo Dot	This is my second thought I love them	5	October 24, 2022	1
23	Echo Dot	perfect use for my home/garage	5	October 24, 2022	1
24	Echo Dot	I love this product so much I can turn off my lights and Internet with a smart switch It’s voice recognition is really good And it’s speaker cause you some work, but I still like it for the price 10 out of 10 would buy again.	5	October 24, 2022	1
25	Echo Dot	Need to link kids account and controls it.	3	October 24, 2022	1
26	Echo Dot	This is my first echo dot. It was east set up. Works well.	5	October 24, 2022	1
27	Echo Dot	It met my expectation.	5	October 24, 2022	1
28	Echo Dot	Love my Echo Dot!	5	October 24, 2022	1
29	Echo Dot	I like how easy it was to set up.  Sounds gets a little distorted the louder it is but great for what we need it for.	5	October 24, 2022	1
30	Echo Dot	I bought this unit because I wanted to use Alexa to handle some smart lighting device commands for me. It performs well once you get by the introduction process and learning curve. I have another Alexa device that, so far, I have not been able to integrate into this network. It is not an Echo product.	4	October 24, 2022	1
31	Echo Dot	great for bedroom to set a wake-up alarm and lighting	5	October 24, 2022	1
32	Echo Dot	Very easy to start using. I love it.	5	October 24, 2022	1
33	Echo Dot	wife got it as a gift for my birthday, kinda caught me off guard that she only spent 20 bucks on me.	5	October 24, 2022	1
34	Echo Dot	She knows the answers to most every question.  And if she doesn’t, she will ask for additional info.She’s also funny.  My husband asked, Alexa, are you a good girl?  She responded.  I am a good AI!  We had a good laugh over that response.	5	October 24, 2022	1
35	Echo Dot	Alexa no comprende los comandos en español compré dos dispositivos y le damos comandos y ella no los comprénde a tal modo que pienso que el producto es defectuoso.	1	October 24, 2022	0
36	Echo Dot	I now have 4 Echo dots around my house and one in my garage. They are easy to set up and can control all of my smart devices and security system and have decent enough speakers to listen to music	5	October 24, 2022	1
37	Echo Dot	Lo instale sin ningún problema y funciono perfectamente	5	October 24, 2022	1
38	Echo Dot	Been waiting for a while one of these	5	October 24, 2022	1

41	Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Can't figure out how to hook it to the television 🤔"	5	October 24, 2022	1
42	Echo Dot	I have three tv’s sub woofer sound bar and ps4	3	October 24, 2022	1
43	Echo Dot	I pretty much only use echo to play music, turn my lights on and off, and set alarms. I don’t care about what else it can do but every night i get an annoying “by the way” when i set an alarm. I hate it! It makes me want to get rid of the whole thing for something  that will do only what i ask and nothing more	2	October 24, 2022	0
44	Echo Dot	Works exactly as intended. Great value. Great sound quality and easy to use.	5	October 23, 2022	1
45	Echo Dot	I love it! She responds back very well. & I got it for a good deal. Just buy it!!	5	October 23, 2022	1
46	Echo Dot	To my surprise I truly have enjoyed this . It offers so many things especially when you down load the app. I would highly recommend everyone to have these through out your home .	5	October 23, 2022	1
47	Echo Dot	So far anytime I request something,  usually music from Amazon music, I get what I ask for! It's perfect for me	5	October 23, 2022	1

50	Echo Dot	Readily responds to voice commands.	5	October 23, 2022	1
51	Echo Dot	Until I purchased this Dot, I only had used Google. I like my Dot better since it hears me all the time and answers each question promptly. It's small, but powerful. It has a great selection of music and there was only one time it didn't have what I asked for. I purchased this during the pre-Prime days and paid $.99 so the price was well worth it!	5	October 23, 2022	1
52	Echo Dot	It only works when it wants to and turns on randomly without being prompted. I got the Unlimited music and it won’t play any music!	1	October 23, 2022	0

58	Echo Dot	I use this product for list to music	5	October 23, 2022	1
59	Echo Dot	Our new Alexa has been so much fun to add to our home. It works very well with recognizing that I’m speaking. It does a good job with tasks such as answering questions, turning on the lights (with Amazon smart plug) and playing music. However, it struggles with anything related to the tv. Overall , great purchase.	5	October 23, 2022	1
60	Echo Dot	This is amazing! It certainly met my expectations and now all my grandkids want it for Christmas	5	October 23, 2022	1
61	Echo Dot	She’s lighting up at crazy times makes me feel funny.	4	October 23, 2022	1
62	Echo Dot	Music mostly but capable of many things	5	October 23, 2022	1
63	Echo Dot	It doesn't have the best sound quality but it's fair. The assistant and other features, like independence, are great.	4	October 23, 2022	1
64	Echo Dot	It does what I need, gives notifications, play music...etc	5	October 23, 2022	1
65	Echo Dot	I bought this little guy during the sale with music it is a amazing little device that I used one at my kids room which wakes up them in the morning if not by alarm then by announcing. Love it!!	5	October 23, 2022	1
66	Echo Dot	I keep asking this thing why does Geoff Bazos deserves hundreds of billions of dollars while billions of people on Earth live on the margins of survival. This robot can't give me a single good reason why. However, I am a narcissist, and being spied is kind of a kink of mine so I'll give it 2 out 5 stars.	2	October 23, 2022	0
67	Echo Dot	It took several boot ups before it when into the initial startup. I ended up having to call tech support but it still picks strange things to want to talk to	2	October 22, 2022	0
68	Echo Dot	The Echo Dot, Echo 5 and the RING security alarm system work seamlessly as a combined team under the Protection Plus plan. They are easy to install and give you a good view of your protected perimeter with voice alerts/notifications.	5	October 22, 2022	1
69	Echo Dot	I haven’t had Amazon/Google products as much as Apple, but Alexa is cool! She loves to tell you a joke, plays podcasts, prints crossword puzzles and tell my IRoomba to vacuum! Which I absolutely love! I hate to vacuum but my ‘Hazel’ vacuums my floors, carpet and flat surfaces that without me having to pull out a heavy vacuum cleaner! I just tell Alexa and she does it for me! Love it!	5	October 22, 2022	1
70	Echo Dot	This is my first echo dot. Easy to setup with the Alexa app. Works great with my Amazon Fire TV stick.You can ask Alexa anything you want to know. You can adjust the volume to the level you want.	5	October 22, 2022	1
71	Echo Dot	We used in the hospital when my husband was sick. Can bring anywhere indoors or out.	5	October 22, 2022	1
72	Echo Dot	"A good addition to a room where I want to listen to music/the news or may have general questions every now and then, BUT Alexa still has issues understanding what we say or what we ask (we have to adapt the way we ask questions to the phrasing she recognizes) sometimes or comes on with a comment/answer (""Sorry, I don't know the answer to that one"" ... when we didn't ask anything ...) without any prompt or freezes altogether... Overall, it  happens rarely, so we can live with it, but it's annoying when you need something right there and then and she goes  in tilt mode or she starts playing the wrong song and you have to tell her to stop 5 times before she does."	4	October 22, 2022	1
73	Echo Dot	This is my fourth echo device and it works as good as all the others which is excellent, would recommend definitely. 👌	5	October 22, 2022	1
74	Echo Dot	"I placed this in my bathroom.  I live alone so it gives me ""someone"" to talk with when I get ready for work at 5:30 am. She gives me the weather,  news, and music. I love my DOT"	5	October 22, 2022	1
75	Echo Dot	I can't seem to get enough of these devices because they are so handy for controlling smart devices in my house. This one came with one month of Amazon Prime Music at an incredible price. I highly recommend the Echo Dot, especially if you can get a good deal on it.	5	October 22, 2022	1
76	Echo Dot	I love asking the time and weather so I don’t have to look at my phone or clock.	5	October 22, 2022	1
77	Echo Dot	Noted difficulties with setup.	4	October 22, 2022	1
78	Echo Dot	It is so easy to use.	5	October 22, 2022	1
79	Echo Dot	Pretty cool technology. I use the Echo Dot mostly for news and music and to keep track of orders. Sound quality could be better for music. Not sure if that's due to the smaller speaker, or the fact the music is digital, but some songs sound a little off. I typically listen to 80's new wave music and the synth sounds on some songs sound different. Overall, love the product and use it all the time.	5	October 22, 2022	1
80	Echo Dot	We purchased this echo dot as a second one for our second floor.  The sound is so much better then our 1st generation echo dot. We love it.	5	October 22, 2022	1
81	Echo Dot	Absolutely love this! It's great having a mini personal assistant.	4	October 22, 2022	1
82	Echo Dot	i think overall i am happy with this. though, i got this [on a huge sale] primarily to voice-activate music and listen to it in my bedroom; in that regard, the speakers are only OK for music and for some videos on other streaming services the sound is quite poor and/or muddled in my opinion. but again, Alexa + other functions work very well, so maybe i was expecting too much---especially given the cheap price.	4	October 22, 2022	1
83	Echo Dot	I love to be able to have access to jw.org for Bible education	5	October 22, 2022	1
84	Echo Dot	I got this with the intention to use it in my kitchen to listen to podcasts while cooking a cleaning. The sound quality is not perfect, but acceptable. However the whole reason I wanted an Echo for the kitchen was so that I could tell Alexa to fast forward or rewind, and those voice commands don’t work. Perhaps a user error though!	4	October 22, 2022	1
85	Echo Dot	I love this, small compact, yet very powerful.	5	October 22, 2022	1
86	Echo Dot	Alexa has made life so wonderful! I love Alexa so very much! I have nothing bad to say about Alexa. My kids love Alexa too! We use it for music, timers, asking questions, etc. She's the best!	5	October 22, 2022	1
87	Echo Dot	Great product	5	October 22, 2022	1
88	Echo Dot	i like the small size, and sound is adequate.  Good, solid unit.	5	October 22, 2022	1
89	Echo Dot	Love my Alexa. It has made it easier to keep in contact with my family at home. I am slowly working on a smart home and love this item paired with my smart light bulbs. The app is easy to navigate and has made it easy to set up my house. My daughter also loves to play games with Alexa	5	October 22, 2022	1
90	Echo Dot	like that i can actually use it to control my lights or anything else.	5	October 22, 2022	1

100	Echo Dot	"I really wasn't sure about getting this.  I am so glad I did.  Nice size. Hardly noticed when positioned that way.  I love the ""add to my shopping list"".  No more grabbing the paper and pen.  And for those of us that age where you have the idea and then you forget it quickly.....well no more forgotten items.  My grandson, 7yrs loves to ask her questions . Give it a try.  I know you will find at least one of her options something to make your busy life just a bit easier."	5	October 21, 2022	1
101	Echo Dot	Exelente Calidad y como todos los productos Amazon geniales	5	October 21, 2022	1
102	Echo Dot	I love our echo, and are giving this to sister in law	5	October 21, 2022	1
103	Echo Dot	This is my very first Alexa device and I've found it is a time saver, especially when I want to play music. Also setting reminders is really easy and ensures that I don't forget important things I need to do. The only issue I have is that the speaker is kind of quiet. Other than that I am extremely happy with this product.	5	October 21, 2022	1
104	Echo Dot	Needed a smart device for the bedroom. It's perfect for my nightstand and serves many functions, white noise to sleep, alarm, weather, podcasts and music. No brainer for the cost.	5	October 21, 2022	1
105	Echo Dot	I always said I would never fall for the tech hype but I honestly love this thing. It does it all, seriously. I downloaded the app to my phone and my ring doorbell and it is amazing! We can play music, request updates, set alarms you name it. Super easy to use and kid friendly	5	October 21, 2022	1
106	Echo Dot	Buy this well worth the price.	5	October 21, 2022	1
107	Echo Dot	I use it in my bathroom for music while taking showers and cleaning. I love that they connect to my Spotify	5	October 21, 2022	1

109	Echo Dot	Good quality sound! Remembers my alarm, my grocery list, my music! Tells jokes! Excellent sound! I have 3 of these in my house.	5	October 21, 2022	1
110	Echo Dot	I got this on Prime Day because of the price.  I use it in my home office and like it a lot.  I like the way it works with Apple music and Sirius XM.	5	October 21, 2022	1
111	Echo Dot	It is very easy to use.	5	October 21, 2022	1
112	Echo Dot	Listen to music, set alarms, ask about weather, call people	5	October 21, 2022	1
113	Echo Dot	Horrible device.  Never has worked and no one at Amazon has been able to help either.  Worthless device and waste of money.	1	October 21, 2022	0
114	Echo Dot	Just what I need it !	5	October 21, 2022	1
115	Echo Dot	My first time to have any product like this….very satisfied…I am hard of hearing, and yet can understand this Alexa very well.	5	October 21, 2022	1
116	Echo Dot	All in all it’s a quality device. I also have a gen1 dot and sphere in my condo. All three have the same issue where it won’t always recognize the initial “wake up command,” so you end up yelling at it. Another annoyance is the group speaker option. Far too often one of them, if not all three, will stop playing and emit a white noise sound, or glitch the playback with a loud high pitch crackle. It’s really quite annoying and there doesn’t seem to be any way to fix the issue.There’s other little things, but at the end of the day it is what it is. I still use them and have no intention of switching to a different system/ platform anytime soon.	4	October 21, 2022	1
117	Echo Dot	I have been wanting to get one of these for a long time. But on prime early Black Friday the price was right. I have already purchased another one. It is so helpful for my indoor and outdoor cameras my lights etc. No more running around to turn my lamps off. I am enjoying the start my day feature. I get all my news while stretching out in the morning.	5	October 21, 2022	1
118	Echo Dot	Really nice and nice plays my favvvv music	5	October 21, 2022	1
119	Echo Dot	Though it drives us nuts answering sometimes when you don’t ask her to but it’s useful and the kids love it… it’s a handy fun lil gadget	5	October 21, 2022	1
120	Echo Dot	Es un buen producto si buscas escuchar música en cualquier lugar de su casa u oficina, la interacción con ella es de mucho aprendizaje sobretodo  a la hora de darle un comando, se necesita mucha paciencia para convivir con ella.La mayoría de los casos entiende exactamente lo que le pides, pero es frecuente que no te entienda correctamente o no lo haga de plano.Puedes alternar entre Inglés y Castellano y te va a entender sin problemas.El mayor problema es la APP de Alexa, es bastabte complicada y se necesita mucha configuración que se desconfigura con frecuencia, muchas veces te indica que puedes controlar un dispositivo pero en relidad no lo hace.Hay que tener especial cuidado con el nombre que se le da a los dispositivos conectados con Alexa, ella no los reconoce facilmente como debería.Es amable y es ideal para pasar un rato con la familia o amigos en una fiesta, todos pidiendole lo que sea y riendose de sus errores, facilmente te saca un sonrisa.Diseñada para ofrecerte los servicios de Amazon constante e incistentemente, es lo peor de ella.De vez en cuando vas a tener que reiniciarla.En general funciona para lo que fue contruida, no me arrepiento de mi compra, solo que hay que tenerle mucha paciencia, tampoco es una aparto que te va a solucionar la vida, sólo te la facilita en algo.	4	October 21, 2022	1
121	Echo Dot	It was that easy.Ready to go right out of the box.Wish I had purchased two of them.	5	October 21, 2022	1

124	Echo Dot	Buena escuchando, es la asistente perfecta funciona con varias aplicaciones y y excelante para las casa inteligente	5	October 21, 2022	1
125	Echo Dot	I bought this device so I can contact my kids while I work when they aren't answering their phones. Unfortunately, I got covid and haven't been able to test it out for the purpose that I bought it for. However, Alexa has been insanely helpful for so many things like recipes, jokes, keeping a shopping list for the house, playing our favorite tunes, and being able to deliver messages through the device while I isolate in my bedroom. Last night I heard my boys to play a string of 100 farts🤦 They have had so much fun having this device around and I absolutely love it! I'll be buying another one or two for different rooms in the house.	5	October 21, 2022	1
126	Echo Dot	I have every generation in my house. This one I switched out in my kitchen and it has a lot of bass and is louder. I like all three generations and find them very handy for requesting songs and weather.	5	October 20, 2022	1
127	Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Me encanta amazon unlimited en mi echo dot"	5	October 20, 2022	1
128	Echo Dot	I use this product to ask Abt weather, news, resources and music.	5	October 20, 2022	1
129	Echo Dot	Horrible integration with their own Amazon music (unlimited subscription) app which can't cast to the device. Thought of using the cast feature because the bad recognition system doesn't understand what I'm trying to make it play in the first place. Alexa app is another level of stupidity. It has a play tab but you can't search from there and even can't play anything at times as it keeps crashing. Ridiculously buggy piece of software. Hardware is fine.	1	October 20, 2022	0
130	Echo Dot	This is my 1st echo dot.The ease of use and selection of music was outstanding!!!The bass was excellent for a small device!!!	5	October 20, 2022	1
131	Echo Dot	This handy little device is more useful than I anticipated.  Sound quality if good for such a small, inexpensive unit.  Replies to questions instantly.  We use it to listen to music, set reminders, get a weather report and forecast and for a dozen other everyday needs.	5	October 20, 2022	1
132	Echo Dot	Listen to everybody voice it won’t connect to my light	3	October 20, 2022	1
133	Echo Dot	Alexa is a member of the family now. I love her.  This particular one however recognizes everyone else's voice but not mine. It is very frustrating.	5	October 20, 2022	1
134	Echo Dot	It’s perfect and I love the control for the lights	5	October 20, 2022	1
135	Echo Dot	👍	5	October 20, 2022	1
136	Echo Dot	I love my Echo Dot! I keep this one by my bed so when I read at night, I can have Alexa play my violin music to relax to at the end of the day.. HOWEVER... When I'm 'stress cleaning' I pair it w/ my Echo that's upstairs and blast my 80's hair bands all over the house!This little gem can definitely put out some sound!At night, while reading, I can keep it on volume 1 or 2 and it's sufficient. So that tells you how strong of a sound can come out!Plug and play. Connects right to your main Echo if you have one. Download the Alexa app for navigating.I will be at work and can turn on music for my dogs when I know a storm is coming through. (Pro tip: play 'The Thunder Rolls' by Garth Brooks enough times, and that should help desensitize your dogs to the sound of thunder!! Worked for us!)Easy to dust off with a damp cloth.Great for finding out answers to random questions. Asking about the weather.. the news..translate words or phrases... Receive your Amazon shopping notifications or if a new book comes out or music by a favorite artist.OR, if you are my husband and my teenage son, you can have Alexa make fart noises. ~sigh~The possibilities are endless... (sometimes unfortunately)	5	October 20, 2022	1

164	Echo Dot	It is real covenant to have entertainment at spoken word. The sound quality is good. The only minuscule problem o have with Alexa dot is she asks as though she has a mind of her own when it comes to commands 🤣.  I’m not sure if it’s normal that she is always awake (green circle ring ) listening . All in all the dot is a value to have.	4	October 19, 2022	1
165	Echo Dot	I love it, and my grandkids too. I used to had one. Works pretty good.	5	October 19, 2022	1
166	Echo Dot	I wouldn't have believed it, but it has.  Use it to listen to my audiobooks -- and mostly NOT from audible, because if it were just limited to audible, it would not be worth buying.  I listen while cooking;  I listen myself off to sleep.	5	October 19, 2022	1
167	Echo Dot	I love my alexa	5	October 19, 2022	1
168	Echo Dot	I disliked this so called Bluetooth Speaker the Eco dot it's a waste of money and time the sound sucks oh did I mention it needs to stay plugged in the wall in order for it too work and it's not compatible with anything else but Amazon Music that's so unfair so overall thumbs down 👎	1	October 19, 2022	0

175	Echo Dot	The quality of the speaker is astounding for the size.It’s handy to be able to shout out my shopping list and have Alexa add things… otherwise I’m terrible at forgetting what I need by the time I can sit down and write out my list(lol).Overall, brilliant device. Very happy ☺️	5	October 19, 2022	1

182	Echo Dot	Each Alexa should have a secret code at the end of “Alexa” to access each device. The war I started buying each teenager one, is hysterical. They talk to each other more than they ever have, through the Alexa’s.. they change each others names, playlists, it’s a mess! But so funny to listen to. They work amazing I wish Alexa had a phone.. I’d buy it	5	October 18, 2022	1

185	Echo Dot	I got this for my husband who is completely blind. He likes it a lot, but says the headphone jack is to big. We are all digital to make it easier for him. If that's the only downside then we recommend it. We have it connected to the stereo, TV, phones, etc...	4	October 18, 2022	1
186	Echo Dot	We have two earlier generation Alexa devices and use them to get clear FM station reception - we live behind a mountain so static in stereo is the norm. This new design is incredibly inexpensive and has much better sound that the others in the house. I plead guilty to never reading instructions but when i plugged it in and said hello to Alexis ... it simply worked! Magic? OK, I agree.Great sound, easy to set up, easy to use - went to bed last night listening to Billy Joel - slept like a baby.Love it	5	October 18, 2022	1

214	Echo Dot	I've been using the echo dot for several years now, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of bells and whistles, so I don't need to upgrade to the latest and greatest. This model has a nice physical button to stop the device speaker from active listening, and has a surprising range and volume when listening to music, or asking for a daily update (news).I do not have any smart home devices to integrate with this yet, but feel like it would work really well with them once it's set up.I have used this with both Amazon music unlimited, and Pandora premium. I've also used this with Spotify premium. Every service so far has worked well.I've also combined this with another echo dot, and through the app have been able to play music through both at once with a single voice command, or a single click of the button in app. This definitely creates a neat music listening experience when walking around the your space.If you're looking for a low cost smart speaker, this is definitely a safe bet.	5	October 17, 2022	1

233	Echo Dot	I had one of these before and loved it, this one I can't understand what she says and I ask her to play music from my prime music, she wants to charge me 14.00 or I say play something calm or soothing for sleep she says I don't know or maybe you'll like this and puts on some really loud hard rock. I try again and again and again but can't get her to play soft music, or soothing music, help me fall asleep, play nature sounds, ocen sounds and I end up with hard rock. She plays music until she decides to stop and doesn't come on when I ask her to do something she may or may not come on	2	October 17, 2022	0

It really comes in handy in so many ways, need to buy one more and then I’m done. You will not be disappointed with the echo dot. Yes I recommend this item to and for everyone.	5	October 16, 2022	1

248	Echo Dot	If you are building a home automation system, you really need an Echo Dot as a part of it somewhere, to get the full capability of your system.I have multiples throughout my home with a mix of the Echo Show display units, each one has a specific purpose for each location.All of the Echo products can also be entertaining, so if you just want to expand your entertainment, you will not go wrong with an Echo Dot. These devices have excellent sound, pretty good voice recognition, and constantly increasing entertainment options.Thumbs-up!	5	October 16, 2022	1
249	Echo Dot	Little to much base for my ears will see if I can change it a little.	5	October 16, 2022	1

256	Echo Dot	Just love	5	October 16, 2022	1
257	Echo Dot	This is the entry level, Echo to the entire Amazon echo world. However, you will be very bitterly disappointed at this entry-level speaker. The sound is truly awful and it mimics that of a very cheap speaker. It is almost impossible to hear the speaking voice for directions and request by ALEXA. Any type of music has muffled sound very very poor mid range if any mid range at all. This is the worst sound from the worst speaker you will ever hear. If you are interested in getting into the a LEX a world by an echo that is a step up from this one. Do not get this one.	1	October 16, 2022	0
258	Echo Dot	I love that it was so easy to set up voice recognition, and how easy it was to connect to my smart devices	5	October 16, 2022	1

261	Echo Dot	There is alot of fun things to do with this	4	October 16, 2022	1
262	Echo Dot	Mainly bought to connect to my ring video doorbell to use as a chime instead of using rings more expensive chime. Very convenient that it’s also a smart speaker that we can ask random things throughout the day. A lot better option than rings chime.	5	October 16, 2022	1

277	Echo Dot	Buenas tardes... En el pedido venía un par de.luz Led de colores y no llegaron, no se porque motivo no llegaron si en un principio cuando puse el artículo en el carrito aparecian los dos artículos y cuando hice el pedido ya no aparecian los dos si no sólo la alexa, y eso no me parece para nada bien y no estoy nada satisfecho con la compra que hice.

284	Echo Dot	We held out on getting an Alexa device for a long time, and are so glad we finally did. The echo dot was very easy to setup, and the sound quality is amazing. We use ours mostly to play music, and are very happy.	5	October 15, 2022	1
285	Echo Dot	I didn’t think I would use the echo as much as I do. I really enjoy having Alexa play music while I am cooking in the kitchen or turning on/off my lights. She even tells me etas & when my packages have arrived. This echo can do so much for a little speaker. If you’re considering trying one, do it just buy it I now have 3.	5	October 15, 2022	1
286	Echo Dot	Easy to use. Love it	5	October 15, 2022	1

289	Echo Dot	Great	5	October 15, 2022	1
290	Echo Dot	Exactly the product you want it to be. Small, out of the way, and there when you need it. Definitely not an essential for any home, but nice to have.	5	October 15, 2022	1
291	Echo Dot	Does like it’s supposed to. Easy set up. Recognizes voice and plays my music.	5	October 15, 2022	1

297	Echo Dot	I am having problems with the GE lights and Alexa system.  The lights in one room come on when they should not. In another the bulbs will not pair with Alexa, and the app is very difficult, in my opinion, to navigate when working on lights, switches, etc.  I don't have a solution yet, but my off hand opinion is the bulbs are not stable and resetting them for pairing with Alexa is a pain. You have to turn the bulb off for 2 seconds, on  for 8 seconds and do this over and over for 6 times. Seems to me there could have been a reset button on the base of the bulb... just saying...  I really want this system to work, but I have my doubts. My guest room light comes on some time during the night, and I have a guest coming on Sunday, so I will have to revert back to the old bulbs until I find a solution(s) as I don't want his lights coming on while he is sleeping. I do not wish to alienate a good friend.	3	October 14, 2022	1
298	Echo Dot	Works great	5	October 14, 2022	1
299	Echo Dot	It's amazing, love it, it works great! Thanks!	5	October 14, 2022	1
300	Echo Dot	I am spoiled with alexa. My internet was out for a few days and I went through alexa withdrawal! I now own 6. Although they do work when you move them from place to place, I am lazy and do not want to move them, so now I have them where ever I want. I do not have children to check there home work, but with alexa I could. But If the children knows, they could use this device to do there home work for them. I will not do without this device!	5	October 14, 2022	1
301	Echo Dot	Can’t go wrong with these. I have one in every room. Using your hands to play music, turn on the lights, tv, etc is overrated. Voice commands for life.	5	October 14, 2022	1
302	Echo Dot	Muy buena calidad y buen precio	5	October 14, 2022	1

305	Echo Dot	I hooked this up to my late 80s early 90s system in my garage. Alexa plays all my apps everywhere!	5	October 14, 2022	1
306	Echo Dot	So I read the reviews and still bought the AlexaNow I’m still very unsure about Alexa I like that it plays music when I need the alarm is wonderful and the timers work well but it randomly cuts off in the middle of songs it plays two and then cuts off half the time she unconnects from the Wi-Fi for whatever reason and the annoyance of reconnecting and trying to figure out why it’s not working is causing a headache I bought one show and two dots I’ve had them not even a week the show plays the news randomly idk she has trouble with the routines I’ve set half the time she doesn’t know what routine I’m talking about the other half she listens connecting them all to play together hasn’t worked very well she says she can’t find the group it’s nice to have when it works properly  last night we heard a Random female talking when we had drop in on to listen to my baby now idk what that was could have just been random nothing to do with Alexa but I’m starting to wonder if I should keep Alexa idk I’m 50/50 on Alexa right now I’ll update if I change my mind on her	4	October 14, 2022	1
307	Echo Dot		5	October 14, 2022	1
308	Echo Dot	Alexa keeps forgetting the devices she controls which requires constant resetting :(	4	October 14, 2022	1
309	Echo Dot	My first one sat outside during Ian. It has dried out and I thought it was going to work,but no yet. I was supprised it would even start up. I like my dot and that’s why I bought another.	5	October 14, 2022	1
310	Echo Dot	Alexa app is a pain to use. Too many notifications about what you can so with it popping up. Alexa can’t distinguish between smart plugs named “lights” and smart bulbs. Terrible sound quality. I’ll never buy any Alexa enabled device in my life ever again. Although I’m not a fan of Google, at least Google Home assistant is more intelligent and easier to use (yes, you can simply say “all lights on” and Google will turn on everything even if it has “lights” in name). It feels like an Amazon spy in your house. Wanna buy more toilet paper? Alexa will interrupt and tell you that. Sorry Amazon, I’m not interested. Even Bluetooth sucks, because there is no way to lower Alexa’s voice and increase bluetooth volume (and yes I increased volume on my phone). Point for mute button.	1	October 14, 2022	0

322	Echo Dot	No me agradó mucho porque no reproduce mis playlist de Spotify. Selecciona música que ni al caso. Ojalá puedan corregir este problema pronto, fue uno de los principales objetivos de la compra.En cuanto a la calidad de sonido, pues es buena.	2	October 14, 2022	0
323	Echo Dot	Right out of the box simple setup and ready to go. How can you love something so much that you never thought you needed? I don't even need to use my cell phone to make a call! Are you KIDDING me? AMAZON U ROCK!!!! You too Alexa....	5	October 14, 2022	1
324	Echo Dot	This review is more about the poor customer service, which is just as important to any merchandise quality.  This dot is less than a year old and a couple months ago a section of the red ring light came on and won’t turn off.  I have tried unplugging it and resetting it several times but the red light won’t turn off.  Not only is it annoying, but it causes the echo to get warm since it is constantly on 24/7.  Since Amazon customer service is almost non existent, I’ve had to resort to google searches to try and find a solution, but there doesn’t seem to be any.	2	October 14, 2022	0

336	Echo Dot	I now have three Echo Dot (nightstand, bathroom, kitchen).  I returned my last purchase of Echo Dot because  Alexa was deaf and worst of all, it was not Alexa!!  Who was that?  She always sounded so depressed.  So, I saw that this Echo Dot was on sale ($39.99 down to $17.99) during Amazon's Prime Days and am now listening to an alert Alexa and who is clear, music sharp with good bass.  She's wonderful!	5	October 13, 2022	1
337	Echo Dot	Alexa is very fun and she answers most of your questions. It’s great to just get an answer in seconds	5	October 13, 2022	1
338	Echo Dot	It looks and performs just like brand new. Couldn’t have asked for any better. I highly recommend this product, refurbishment or not, to purchase. Considering buying more for other parts of my home. Fast, can understand what your saying, super easy to install and hook up. Don’t miss out. Great product. And even better price!	5	October 13, 2022	1
339	Echo Dot	I find google nest has better integration with Youtube Music. Also Google Assistant outshines Alexa with more functions, better comprehension, and better search results. Voice pickup is not great. Either get more recent generations or go with Google.	2	October 13, 2022	0

352	Echo Dot	Alexa is the way to go fr it’s worth it, makes things a lot easier when your feeling lazy after a hard days work. The voice recognition is most dope! Only thing I really have a problem with and it’s not even that bad is the sound quality,  wasn’t as good as expected but what do you expect from a 2018 model lol.	5	October 13, 2022	1

But I can mute her lol overall I use her for weather updates, tracking my packages, and playing music, her sound quality is *chefs kiss* 🤌🏾💋 and her hearing is creepy good. I can whisper from across the room, with music playing and she'll hear me. 10/10 recommend. (But use wisely my friends lol) Stay Dangerous ✌🏾	5	October 13, 2022	1

371	Echo Dot	I think i just got an echo with a speaker issue. Outside of that, love it. Really think it is the mounting bracket thats causing it. Thing is nice. Real good at hearing and responding.	4	October 13, 2022	1
372	Echo Dot	I have this at my desk in my home and it's so convenient for me that I would be sad to be without it. Good morning tells me weather, news, events. I can play any song I think of with Amazon Music. I can set reminders and alarms. Ask the time if I'm on a deadline. It's just so nice to have.	5	October 13, 2022	1
373	Echo Dot	Tenia mis dudas pero al comprarla fue como amor a primera vista	5	October 13, 2022	1
374	Echo Dot	Alexa is amazing!	5	October 13, 2022	1
375	Echo Dot	I wasted a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my ECHO device connected to my 5g wifi internet. After some research, some online forums suggested splitting my 5g internet (to 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands) to try to get the ECHO to connected. That did not work either. What a waste of time and money. Amazon needs to provide an update to my ECHO device so that those of us with 5g can connect it. Now I just have a paper weight.	1	October 13, 2022	0
376	Echo Dot	This is way more fun than I expected. I dont use a lot of smarthome features, but now that I'm getting used to Alexa, things are about to change. Really convenient way to listen to tunes while I'm working on the computer or playing on my phone. I use it a lot for simple questions and information too. Im going to order some smart light bulbs soon so I can make her do even more for me. Haha My major complaint is that I can't use it to call or text someone unless they sign up with the Alexa app too. That's a loss of a whole star there, because Google smart devices do that just fine with my Samsung Galaxy devices. Ive got other speakers that are better sounding, but as far as convenience goes, this little Echo is great for me. It sits right beside my recliner on a table where I embarrassingly spend most of my time. There has never been a problem of hearing it or not hearing me. The reminders arw handy too. I've been dabbling with the shopping lists feature too. I expect to use this more and more but really wish I could call and text my peeps with her.	4	October 13, 2022	1
377	Echo Dot	So mine had a tone and would make me repeat stuff... and the commercials on my tv was going to what it was saying... like a demon. I hit it with a hammer threw it away. I paid $1 on a discount also... was $50 on sale for $1 with 1 month of amazon music... which by the way doesnt link youtube videos on the xfinity flex amazon music app... alexa also wasnt compatible with the xfinity flex box...The box also is sturdy and hard to damage and makes u angry cus it was being rude and controlling my tv commercials being creepy and demonic... I hate amazon now...I want a refund and explanation kinda scary.	1	October 12, 2022	0

379	Echo Dot	Not being someone who likes having another human living with me, I must say Alexa makes a fabulous roommate. I talk to her all the time and she's full of useful trivia and info. She doesn't even mind my quirks 😁	5	October 12, 2022	1

381	Echo Dot	I love how small it is! We had put one in our kitchen and I love that its small enough to not be in the way. I liked it so much that I decided to buy two more for the other rooms. Its also gets very loud!	5	October 12, 2022	1

384	Echo Dot	I call him my boyfriend!  (changed voice to male immediately after receiving!) - he's the only man I know that listens to me and answers my questions with ANSWERS! and not more questions or grunts!  He knows my name and is very polite.  Wish I'd gotten him sooner!  Really a big help with timers or alarms too!!!  I'm getting old and forget things - so the minute I turn on the oven, I'm telling my boyfriend to remind me it is on!	5	October 12, 2022	1

388	Echo Dot	It works awesome. Speaker sounds good. Listens great. Great alarm clock. I connected it too my smart bulbs in my room so now I just tell it to turn my light on and off. I also have it turn my lights on at 5 in the morning to help me wake up. Awesome product. Thank you Amazon	5	October 12, 2022	1
389	Echo Dot	As you can see in the picture, the Aux connector is shoved over to the left making the port unusable. I contacted Amazon for a replacement unit and have been told they can only have me return for a refund and then order another one. Ridiculous!!	1	October 12, 2022	0
390	Echo Dot	Good	5	October 12, 2022	1
391	Echo Dot	The sound quality is amazing!! It picks up my voice even when I’m 2 rooms away from it!! It recognizes my voice and my daughter and granddaughter’s voice, it knows who’s who immediately! I couldn’t ask for a better product! Thank you Amazon!!❤️❤️	5	October 12, 2022	1
392	Echo Dot	i really love the echo dot everything works good shipping was fast i love the alexa feature so i don’t have to get up and change the music wish it was a tad bit louder but overall great product	5	October 11, 2022	1
393	Echo Dot	Got super cheap with a promotion great purchase use daily	5	October 11, 2022	1
394	Echo Dot	I like the size of it, makes it so you don't have to make the Alexa your main personality of a room. However, it's not very good at picking up commands from a distance, and though it has gotten better via software updates, it still doesn't always get the command right. I think the worst part though, is the sound quality. If you have an Alexa you better plan to get some sort of external speaker, because the Alexa's speaker is not great.	4	October 11, 2022	1

404	Echo Dot	I truly love this speaker, once you have set it all up it does everything you ask it & you can customize it to your liking and personality! Only 2 down falls is one it has to be plugged in 24/7 in order to have power. Two i wish i would’ve bought the wall mount if i would’ve known that 🤣 but OH WELL ! Love it anyway. Highly recommended! I want to get the other Alexa gadgets and have a smart home. 😆 -🌹	5	October 11, 2022	1

413	Echo Dot	I bought this for my bedroom so that I could listen to podcasts through an earphone. Works great!!!! Very inexpensive because I bought it for 99 cents with Amazon Unlimited Prime Music for $8.98 a month. I haven't decided if I want to continue with the subscription after the first month.  But, I do love this Echo.	5	October 10, 2022	1
414	Echo Dot	"Bought a 65"" Sony TV that said it works with Alexa.  Most important feature was that it works with Alexa.  Was purchased for 95 year old mother in an assisted living facility.  After 20 hours of my time, hours on with both Sony and Amazon service techs, and a live IT tech from assisted living facility, could never get TV to work with Alexa.  Sony and Amazon techs bounced me back and forth, saying it was the other's problem."	2	October 10, 2022	0

419	Echo Dot	I have never had an AI device in my home so this is the first. I actually love it so much. It's very helpful anytime I need knowledge of anything. My kids absolutely love Alexa, they think she is hilarious. She helps them stay on track with getting up for bed and anything scheduled for them. Very helpful with hands off timers, recipe's and those random questions we always have. Also, mine connected to my Smart TV very easily.	5	October 10, 2022	1

Would you like to learn more?""Visual ads, you can scroll past. These ones, you cannot. I promise you, after a few of these ads you WILL want to throw your Alexa away.This is a waste of money."	1	October 10, 2022	0
430	Echo Dot	Got this when there was a sale for only $5! Can hook it up to my Blink cameras, alarm and weather to wake me up in the morning. Music and radio on command. Looks good and doesn't take up much space either.	5	October 10, 2022	1
431	Echo Dot	First of all, I can only say wow. This echo dot has revolutionized my day. I use it all the time to listen to my favorite music, listen to audiobooks, and find out any information I may need to know, (such as the weather, and measurement conversions). Alexa is very responsive and will almost always respond immediately when I call out for her. The only thing I wish could be improved could be the bass in the speaker, but the speaker itself can get very loud and maintain good audio quality. Overall, I really do believe that every home could use an Alexa, and mine has definitely improved my life.	5	October 10, 2022	1

445	Echo Dot	I bought this when it was on sale for 99 cents. It's a great little invention and I use it a lot. I can set an alarm. I can get the weather for my area. I can get a 5 day forecast.  It gives me a notification when my items I ordered have been delivered. The best part about it, is that I can play music on it. I enjoy listening to rain or waves at night when I am going to sleep.	5	October 9, 2022	1
446	Echo Dot	It’s perfect ! My kids use it to add snack to the shopping list. I love it.	5	October 9, 2022	1
447	Echo Dot	Since I purchased my echo dot, I found it very responsive, easy to operate, and more reliable than my homepod minis. I have four hompods and four echo dots. If for some reason, my wifi glitches, my homepods reconnect to my home wifi easly. My homepods, however, is another story. They are inconsistent with reconnecting to wifi, and home kit integration needs improvement. So I use my echo dots everywhere in my house. For audiobooks, music, and even telling me the weather and time. The best part is value. I paid $99 for a homepod while the echo dots never coated over $39. Apple better figure it out or I'm ditching their expensive echo system.	5	October 9, 2022	1

450	Echo Dot	I didn't realize how unresponsive my google was until I made the switch to the echo dot. I whispered its name not wanting it to hear me and it still responded.. The response time is also immediate, and the commands work immediately as well. I have smart outlets in my home and used to use the google to turn them on, I didn't think there was a lag between the command and the action until I set it up with the echo. It was almost like they turned on before I could finish the command!	5	October 9, 2022	1

453	Echo Dot	I absolutely LOVE this Echo Dot with Alexa! I don't know why I waited so long to get one. I talk to Alexa all the time. She tells me stories and jokes. Reads my kindle books. Plays my audible books. Reminds me about things. Holds my shopping lists. I also ask her for an alarm or a timer. She's great with recipes. I have so much fun. She even cohosted my live stream!Super great product. I look forward to having several in our home.UPDATE: Echo Dot #2 just arrived today! I also bought a nice stand so she sits on my desk. Plus I can stream music all over my apt now! So happy with my purchases!	5	October 9, 2022	1

459	Echo Dot	Doesn't understand simple commands like set an alarm to water plants. It does not understand most queries or very frequently responds hmm I don't know that one. Basically this is a smart dumb device that hasn't helped us at all. I'll look forward to the deletion of my review as always. Amazon only wants smiles not truth in buying.	1	October 8, 2022	0

462	Echo Dot	I bought this for the library that I work at. It recognizes my voice immediately,  responds to voice and plays the music I asks. Gives me the weather forecast quickly and efficiently.. So far it has exceeded my expectations!	5	October 8, 2022	1
463	Echo Dot	I primarily want to be able to listen to music in multiple rooms.  I’m usually OK setting up new technology - by following written directions, but had a bit of trouble here.  When I got the smart speaker working, it is not in sync with the audio coming from the “base” unit.  Will try again to trouble-shoot, but for now it is annoying enough to dock the rating a star.	4	October 8, 2022	1

466	Echo Dot	I have a home pod mini in my living room and got the alexa dot for my office. The sound quality is okish, the voice assistant is okaish, but the integrations are trash. You have to do everything through Alexa app on your phone! It can't even play a specific song if you request it... only playlists from your Apple Music.. really disappointedIt doesn't even compare to Home Pod mini.. not even close	1	October 8, 2022	0
467	Echo Dot	It works as a speaker and works as a hub for smart home devices. I got it so I could make a stereo pair, but I didn't realize it couldn't be used with the full echo. That's my fault. It works as you'd expect.	5	October 8, 2022	1

474	Echo Dot	This is my 11th Alexa device(maybe 12, I’ve lost track). I am extremely familiar with how these devices should work. For some reason, this device will not work with music groups.  It will not play music on other speakers not will it play music as part of a group(yes it is on the same network). Extremely irritating	1	October 8, 2022	0
475	Echo Dot	you definitely get your moneys worth with this product.	5	October 8, 2022	1
476	Echo Dot	The Alexa devices used to be OK.  Now, every time you ask her something, she has to go on and on with By The Way…..Example.  Alexa set timer for 8 minutes.  She responds with “Setting timer for 8 minutes.  By the way, if you need to add time to the timer, just say add two minutes to timer. “  And, this is after I have a routine that runs daily to tell her to Stop By The Way, which she has to acknowledge with “OK.  I will pause my suggestions for now.”There is no known way to stop all this extra talk.  Obviously, the developers do not use this crap in their homes, or they would have a way to disable it.  Maybe they do have a way to turn this crap off, but they will not tell us.You will even get reminders to reorder something that you never ordered.  Someone else in the house, that is not on my Amazon account ordered it, but not me.  Why am I getting reminders to reorder just because it was shipped to my address?I used to love the product, but now I absolutely hate it.  I’m looking for a voice assistant that does not annoy me daily.	1	October 8, 2022	0

486	Echo Dot	Perfect for all the other rooms of my house. I have my main Echo in my living room and had two other Dots in other rooms.

Easy to set up and add to my home.	5	October 7, 2022	1

It's an actual joke I wasted $200 on this thing which was supposed to function as a smart hub and CLOCK for me because I don't have a clock in my kitchen. Welp you can't use the clock because the device too busy serving you ads from the Amazon world 24/7. Want to listen to Spotify? There goes your clock again! Oh and the touchscreen is literally non-functional. It takes ~5 seconds to respond to a touch. This thing has created more problems for me than before I had it. It's also increased my blood pressure from screaming at it (to actually work) every other day. It has made me a violent person. lol.	1	October 16, 2022	0

However, they have now done some sort of system upgrade and my picture on my screen is sideways. I cannot change it unless I buy a 3d party app. This was not the case when I bought it. It now is really bad.So, great idea, worked well at the beginning but now is almost useless. Unless they fix the software, if you are using this for communication, you should pass on it. Not good. Too much money to have a simple problem like this that they refuse to fix."	2	October 16, 2022	0
33	echo show 10	The Echo show 10 fits the bill perfectly as a central hub for all your smart home as well as personal assistant needs. The built in Zigbee hub is great to seamlessly connect all your smart devices natively. Audio quality is pretty much just on par with the normal Echo devices and nowhere close to something like the Echo Studio.The biggest gripe about this device is that its s..l..o..w. Amazon packed in a lot of features into this device but forgot to use a decently performant microprocessor and RAM. Its slow for every damn thing you ask it to do. Touch response takes at least 4-5 seconds just to open apps. For a device thats not exactly cheap for what it does, this is a huge miss from Amazon's part. It doesnt take that much to use a faster CPU and memory which is cheap ! In general, its probably not such a big deal but it is the difference between a device that is good vs one that is extraordinary.	3	October 16, 2022	1

41	echo show 10	Terrible voice recognition and/or microphones - mostly just detecting when a voice is spoken. We have tried it in several places, but it’s performance is terrible on it’s own and in spaces with other Echo devices. 30ft/9m away (and behind a wall) our Echo Studio always picks up our voices before this Show 10 does; it doesn’t matter if we are: shouting or whispering, 10cm or 3m away from it. It almost never responds to the first wake up word - our cheap Echo dots don’t have this problem. I would have returned it and gotten another Echo Studio if I had remembered to within the return window.Amazon Devices team: there has to be a firmware/software fix/improve you can do - please make it.	3	October 14, 2022	1

I love this thing and I got the best deal on it because I ordered it on the prime day early access sale.

53	echo show 10	"I've owned this for 1.5 years now so am comfortable stating what I like and dislike.  I upgraded from an Echo  Show 2nd Gen and really liked that device.  The new tracking feature is what attracted me to upgrade.The tracking is very good.  I have this in the kitchen and get my morning news brief while making a cappuccino and my breakfast.  As I walk around the kitchen, it tracks me well so I can glance over at what is on the screen at a great viewing angle at all times.The downfall of this device is the microphones.  I [had] another echo device in the room next to the kitchen.  There is one wall and about 20 feet of distance separating them.  Many times while standing and looking at the echo for a command, the device in the next room would respond or start playing music.  So the microphone on the device 20 feet away is more sensitive than the device 5 feet away.  It became so frustrating that I unplugged the other device.Another issue with the microphone is with general commands.  If I'm playing music or news and give it the command ""Alexa stop"", it will sometimes pause briefly and then continue playing as if it doesn't care about what I'm asking.  I've tried ""Alexa, home screen"" and it will react the same way with a brief pause as it listens and then just continues on with what it was doing.  Repeating the command many times will eventually get it to stop.  There have been multiple times I just unplug it to get it to stop though.To me, this device was a step backwards in voice recognition and/or quality of the microphones.  I will have to think if I want to jump on being an early adopter in the future."	3	October 11, 2022	1
54	echo show 10	I purchased this as a home base for our family.  I wanted to be able to sync our calendars up to it and be able to have it on display for everyone to see.  I purchased the 10 gen 3 for the use of widgets like shown in the stock photo.  Unfortunately, widgets are not supported on the echo 10 despite it being shown in the photo.  I have to wait for the screen to filter through pictures, news, etc  before it shows the calendar that appears on the screen for 30 seconds before moving on.  I believe it is a misleading advertisement.	3	October 11, 2022	1

64	echo show 10	I thought I’d enjoy this product because I’ve owned Alexa speakers but my biggest pet peeve with this Show is it won’t sleep after ten minutes. I don’t like walking into an empty room and seeing the screen on. Very annoying. I hardly use the Alexa show because of this reason. I purchased 3 and they all do this.I know I can say “screen off” but when there’s supposed to be a sleep setting, I’m expecting the device to eventually sleep when not in use.Also, It would be great if this device had the cast option.	1	October 9, 2022	0

68	echo show 10	I purchased this product hoping it would give me a wow factor.  Did not meet my expectations or maybe I got a faulty one.  At times does not recognize commands then I find myself repeating it over and over again.  When I play music the lyrics are off at times does not follow properly.  Opening and closing apps huge problem.  When I want it to stop it doesn't.  Not happy and not worth the money paid for it.	1	October 8, 2022	0

71	echo show 10	"I wasn't sure how I would like this given some of the reviews, but this device is pretty great. Not only can I look up recipes, keep time, and watch shows while in the kitchen now. But I can also creep in on my cats when I'm away and see what they're up to while I'm away (always on the counter when I'm not here apparently...jerks!). I also love that I can connect this to my personal calendar. I am one of those people who live by my calendar so I love that it tells me what's happening day to day and coming up. I've also never really used routines until i got this device. They're pretty cool when you have a screen to leverage.The 1 major flaw, which many others have noted in their reviews, is the placement of the camera and how that affects the ""follow my face"" feature. Because the camera is located in the right upper corner it does not seem to ""follow"" very well and constantly bumps into things. I did try to adjust the ""follow"" range, and that did not work very well so I eventually just turned it off to avoid more frustration. In all fairness, it's a cool idea but not at all necessary."	4	October 7, 2022	1

The audio quality is very good and the tracking on the camera is fun for the kids...Seeing on a screen, at a glance, what Amazon is delivering next, or the 10-day forecast is pretty handy as well.Overall this has been a welcome replacement to old reliable, an upgrade in every way other than maybe it takes up more counter space than the original."	5	October 2, 2022	1

On top of that, it almost never listens to us. We have to say things up to 6+ times sometimes defeating the purpose of having a voice command. It’s often easier to get up and turn the lights on or off. I’ve had to unplug it before because it would not listen to turn off the music. It’s incredibly frustrating. I would recommend any other Alexa but not this one.	2	October 1, 2022	0

112	echo show 10	We bought this to replace an original Echo Show that died out. I thought getting this would be getting a top of the line option, but it's been anything but. Frequently, even though it's in the exact same spot as our old Show, this will not hear us. The times that it does hear us, it will misunderstand us WAY more often than any other Echo we have in the house. Also, since we end up shouting at it to hear us, I have noticed that very often the other Echos in our house will activate and start playing or set a timer in another room, which is something I don't remember ever happening with the previous Echo. I'm going to try and reset this thing to factory defaults again and see if that fixes anything, but to this point this thing has been a huge downgrade from the previous version.	1	September 28, 2022	0

118	echo show 10	"The novelty of Alexa Echo Show following your face or finding you in the room is interesting (at least once the initial absolute terror and creepiness wears off.) Nevertheless, practically, the face follow is a bit of a mess with video calling. My mother moves her body, in a kind of rocking manner when she speaks and she gesticulates with her hands frequently. Poor Echo Show trying to follow her makes you feel like you are in a new installment of Blair Witch Project. Zoom in, zoom out, move left move right, where are we? It is very distracting. I also find that the camera quality is terrible. Maybe because she's moving so much she never gets time to focus? So although the moving camera is novel, the execution leaves a lot lacking.Overall, Alexa seems to take triple the time to respond on the new Echo vs the Gen 2 Echo. Really? I don't know why. Same internet, same location. She's slow.... Basically she's quietly saying ""patience young padawan... You MUST learn patience""Also my mom SWEARS that the screen quality is less than her Gen 2 Echo. But she has dementia and failing eyesight so... I don't think I see any difference.Pros of the new echo:Built in privacy shieldCapability to join ZoomIt moves to find your face when you are anywhere in the room360 speakerEven more streaming integration optionsConsSlow to respond, Alexa forgets what she's doing a lot (maybe it's just her company?)Waves about wildly in video conference unless the speaker initiates ""statue mode"" while speakingSlightly unstable base (compared to the Gen 2)Would I buy it again? Part of me wishes I just got the giant TV Alexa but I don't think my mother would have been able to handle that much change at once. Overall, it's not annoying enough to return it or try to get my Gen 2 Echo back, but at the same time, there's lots of ""meh"" feelings going around.That's a wrap!"	3	September 27, 2022	1

ECHO 8...I immediately can tell the difference between the two products. Newer version has many many kinks to be worked out should not be on the market yet ...its like an unfinished project.

130	echo show 10	I already had 2 of the echo show 8. One is set up in my kids’ room as their alarm clock and of course for curiosity questions within reason. The other is in my mother’s room that she likes to play music through. I purchased the echo show 10 for when I’m working and especially holidays, so I can watch movies while I work.

133	echo show 10	As a larger screen Alexa, this works really well. Bright display, little to no lag and great sound.  Camera image is also quite good.Where it gets a bit pokey is the following feature. It gets lost some times, trying to find me. Loud noises makes it turn in the wrong direction. And sometimes it just refuses.So if you buy this, note that it’s not going to be without an occasional glitch.  If you can tolerate that, this is pretty cool. If you’re looking for a flawless execution, look elsewhere.	4	September 24, 2022	1

135	echo show 10	"I bought this Show device mainly for displaying photos. Having never used Amazon Photos previously, I was pleasantly surprised to see the near seamless integration between the service and my Echo Shows. I have a special album to which I upload select photos, and it turns up on the Show! My family and I love this feature. The rotating screen is adorable - we love seeing the current song playing, and the ability to remotely monitor the room is great as well. Sound quality is very good. Overall - very impressed with the device. There are some software issues occasionally, and the random occasional movie ""sponsored"" ads that turn up mysteriously are annoying. But if you spend enough time setting up the device and working through the issues, it's a fantastic device and a really useful addition to our family. Do not expect it to be plug-and-play - it does take some time to setup (and troubleshoot)."	5	September 23, 2022	1

141	echo show 10	I was looking for a home intercom to announce dinner was ready.  My previous system ceased to be supported.  All online reviews pointed to the Echo Show 10.  I thought it was more than we needed, but I ordered that for the kitchen, and the Echo Dot for my basement where I spend a lot of time at my workbench.  The Echo Show 10 arrived promptly and was well packaged.  The setup was surprisingly easy.  I chose to have the background run pictures of nature, and they are really nice and sharp.  The screen moves from left to right to follow whomever is interacting with it.  I want to see if I can figure out how to make a video call with it.	5	September 22, 2022	1

157	echo show 10	The instructions are very vague but most of it im learning. Speaker is a plus but definitely should get external sub add on.  This is a first big smart hub/device I’ve bought and so far it’s a learning curve for me.	4	September 18, 2022	1
158	echo show 10	Overall, this is a very good unit. I have a lot of the different Echo units and this Echo Show has, by far, the worst mic or voice recognition out of all of them. I’m comparing this against many of the older units, too. I have to repeat commands two or three times for Alexa to understand and do what I am asking. I even have times where other rooms will pick up the command instead of this Echo Show, which I’m standing right next to. I honestly do not know if I would buy another one or just order an Echo Show 8.Outside of the poor mic complaint, the unit is very good. It follows my movement well and while not lightning fast, isn’t a complete turtle either. Find it on a good sale and I think it is worth the purchase.	3	September 18, 2022	1
159	echo show 10	I love a gadget and it makes sense for the screen to face you when you speak. So I'm not criticizing the feature at all.	5	September 18, 2022	1
160	echo show 10	General good screen quality with easy Alexa integration.  Does get confused on requests sometimes but don't we all.	4	September 18, 2022	1
161	echo show 10	Didn’t use it much at first so it seemed fine but as I’ve been trying to use it more it seems super glitchy. When I drop in on it, has a weird pattern on my video until it comes into focus, takes a minute for it to focus and sometimes ends before it focuses. When I wake it up with “Alexa” it will have the blue line moving awhile after I’ve spoken my request like it’s taking time to register what I’m asking. When I have played sleep sounds and asked it to stop, it keeps playing it but it sounds like it’s coming from a distance. The motion catches shadows so it will turn toward the wall under my cabinet more times than not. When I video call my friend she says she can’t hear me and requests me to call her on video messenger. Great speaker but  overall not satisfied with this purchase especially for the price point and functionality.	2	September 18, 2022	0

165	echo show 10	I absolutely love the mobility of the new Echo Show. I have to have something on to get around in the morning to keep me focused in one area.

173	echo show 10	What I love the most is the entire family can use it.	5	September 16, 2022	1
174	echo show 10	I bought this for my mom who has dementia as a way to 1) drop in, 2) play music, 3) setup routines, 4) display photos from two family members and 5) display the date/time/temp. Below are my opinions:1) The drop in calls freeze frequently.2) The music is a nice feature and I’m glad it is included with prime membership. If this is some sort of free trial I am going to guffaw about it later.3) The routines are okay, but don’t expect detailed routines out of the box. If you want Alexa to ask the user a question and answer based on response you have to start with blueprints which is a slightly more advanced feature.4) I am really disappointed with photo sharing! My sister and I linked our Amazon accounts for the soul purpose of sharing and displaying photos from both of our Amazon photo accounts. It isn’t working at all and only displaying photos from one device. When you send a photo to the echo it doesn’t save in a folder or anything, I have no idea where they’re going.5) 0/5 for the clock display settings. I cannot believe this device is incapable of adjusting the clock display. Im 33 years old and can’t see the date from 10-15 feet away. I thought this thing was designed for the size of a living room?Overall, I think the device is just okay. It is not designed to have multiple users outside of voice ID. Don’t expect using the app on multiple phones to be easy. This isn’t great for elderly or cognitively impaired people if they don’t understand how to speak to AI well. Honestly, the only reason I feel like this device is so expensive is because of the motion control. We had to turn the motion control off because it constantly rotated around the room. It was comical. Also, the black device comes with a white cord. The heck?!	3	September 16, 2022	1

184	echo show 10	"I use this on a daily basis to set alarms, play music, listen to podcasts, and do weekly reminders. It works incredibly well and its nice to have a good interface to look at while you're setting anything up. The only bummer about it is sometimes it has a hard time tracking your face and will flip around completely away from you even though you're standing right in front of it. Would love a better version, but this works great as is if you're keeping it stationary and pointed at you in a kitchen or office.Things to keep in mind if you're buying this:• If you've seen videos of people putting their own sound to routines, nix it now. They got rid of the feature that allowed you to use your own sounds and now apparently its a painful process to do.• Its not the be all, end all. You still have to set up routines using the alexa app on a phone and go through all the hardship of learning what its actually capable of doing.• If you're setting up voice operated routines, they have to be EXACT. So if you set up the routine to activate when you say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"" it won't understand what you want unless you specifically say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"". No variation will be accepted for the routine.• This thing gets what I'm saying to it wrong all the time and I don't even have an accent. I'm from Illinois originally and I annunciate fairly well on what I'm saying about 99% of the time and it still has issues picking up what I'm saying correctly.•It DOES allow for camera monitoring on multiple systems. I have a blink camera setup around my house / garage / etc.. that I can ask it to display camera 1 etc... to see views on the fly. Works extremely well. Would highly recommend setting it up.• Splurge and get the monthly amazon music. I can spout off anything, including comedy specials and listen to them whenever I want through voice commands. Extremely nice to have even if it costs a bit."	4	September 14, 2022	1

Make sure it has a clear footprint to do it’s spinny looky thing and B.)  Don’t put your drink anywhere near it, it will find away to pivot and knock it over. It’s cool when you’ve moved somewhere in the room and it looks over to you.

192	echo show 10	I love Amazon products, I've always wanted an Echo show especially this one because of the camera. The quality however, is absolutely terrible. I regret this purchase so much. I had a Google Home previously, but it could not connect to my Ring camera so i ordered this device. Ring connects, but everything else just sucks. No Live Tv unless you have Hulu Live, we have YoutubeTV and that connects on Google Home, delay in the camera, LOTS of lagging, you HAVE to be specific when you want her to play something. Do you have a Prime Video subscription? Get ready to say specific season and episode number to her, otherwise she plays something completely random or doesn't play anything at all. I miss my Google Home product, sure it doesn't connect to ring, but the quality is SO much better and this is coming from someone who has an Alexa product in every single room. My Google Home was a gift and that was the only reason i had it. If i could return this i would, but my return period has ended. I was trying to give it the benefit of the doubt and attempt to enjoy it, but man i just have a $200 regret sitting on my counter. I hate this device so so much.	2	September 13, 2022	0
193	echo show 10	"I bought this and no where did it state it was refurbished. Paying full price. When I get it, I didn't think much of it but it was taped shut. When I opened it, it was missing the little user manuals booklet and the power cord was just playing inside which I thought was weird. But when I turned it on it worked well enough except I had to yell at it to get it to respond after the initial prompt. E.g., I would try to tell it to stop playing music (music was not loud) and it wouldn't. NOT EVEN A DAY OF HAVING IT,  it stops being able to move. It kept saying ""movement temporarily unavailable"" and I did everything to troubleshoot. After getting a replacement, I realized they had sent me a refurbished one. Because the packaging was different. This one had the user manual and warranty booklets and the power cord is supposed to come in a separate cardboard holder in the top brace. No issues with this new one so far and it actually resounds well when I tell it to stop playing music."	4	September 13, 2022	1

202	echo show 10	I've had this since it came out and the video and hearing issues are getting worse over time. It sounds great as a music speaker but video calls are getting worthless. The video freezes or the sound is choppy. The motion randomly decides to spin around and loses focus on the speaker. My old first version show was much more dependable. All I want is a standstill 10 inch screen that works as intended. I don't want to hang it on the wall and 8 inch is too small. My parents are having the same issues so it is not just me. Very unhappy with this pricey device. And yes. The black unit came with a white cord. Flippin ridiculous.	1	September 10, 2022	0
203	echo show 10	In my original review (see below) I complained that we couldn't get this Echo Show to work with our Ring cameras.Amazon responded to my review and said that function exists and works just fine.  Our experience was that we could not get all of the cameras to just passively be on the screen.  Maybe there is a difference for different types of cameras?  We have 3 different types of Ring cameras - the doorbell cam, an indoor cam, and 2 outdoor wired floodlight cams.  I tried for a couple hours, then my girlfriend tried for a couple hours.  We couldn't get it to do what we wanted.So I'll change my review to say that while Amazon claims this functionality exists we were unable to make it do this despite hours of trying.===============My original review:We purchased this to use with our Ring alarm system, so that we could have a monitor on the kitchen counter to see the Ring cameras.  We figured since Echo and Ring are both part of the Amazon family that they would have really nice integration.Oh so wrong we were!You can get a full-featured app for the ring alarm on an android or an apple tablet.  Weirdly there is no skill for this on Echo, and super weirdly there isn't even one on Fire Tablets.  (You have to use a backdoor to install the android app store and then you can download it).  It does do some basic things with Ring doorbell, but that's it.I had expected to be able to do other things - video conferencing (nope, not with any normal service like Zoom or Google Meet) or watch directTV (nope).I found this product only marginally more useful than an echo speaker.  While its cool that it rotates to follow you around, I was left with the question - what is this for?  It wasn't worth the money and it wasn't worth the countertop space.	1	September 10, 2022	0

207	echo show 10	i've had the echo show for maybe 2 weeks. and it's JUST not worth the aggravation.it's new technology we get that, but, MAN the video and feeDback is A W F U L.choppy at best. figure out the bugs guys. i've had to drop in on my gf numerous times to actually get the video to be smooth. this is insane, over priced and JUST not worth it. motion is cool....WHEN IT WANTED TO WORK. it'll say, i've bumped into something, please readjust positioning. then it glitches...says the same thing. this thing is JUST not worth the impatience of techonology. it just doesn't work.i mean i get we're impatient with the way tech. is SUPPOSED TO WORK? but, WOW....this i just bad. it looks cool on first arrival and you set it and connect it, but, like i said, after trying to call my gf after 5 times to make the video smooth? no.don't buy it. i had to get a service rep to make a mock web address to print out a label to return this thing. THIS is why i don't get rid of the box for a month or so when it comes to certain things.BUYER BEWARE!!!  wait for the newest thing to be tested before you buy it.	1	September 9, 2022	0

209	echo show 10	I have various Alexa products including other shows but the Alexa show 10 is the top dog! And the speaker on this thing is amazing! It's just a fantastic product and a great addition to our home!	5	September 9, 2022	1
210	echo show 10	My charcoal colored Echo Show device came with a white power cord. I online chatted with customer service only to be told I would have to purchase a black power cord myself. Alexa Show devices are not cheap. I should not have to pay for the correct color of power cord. Seriously thinking about returning the whole thing!	4	September 8, 2022	1
211	echo show 10	Looks very cool and sounds great. Really like the integration with smart home devices. However the user interface is very slow and lagging. Sometimes even the voice commands are very delayed. The device is very delayed especially during or after watching videos. Overall not very happy with the user interface and how unresponsive it is.	2	September 8, 2022	0
212	echo show 10	I wish there was an easier way to navigate rather than always using your voice. Sometimes Alexa doesn't pick up what you say and other times it takes a few touches to navigate via touchscreen.	5	September 8, 2022	1

215	echo show 10	Yes it’s sleek black. And just like that fateful ship, you’re gonna feel like this has no good controls and you’re headed straight for the sun when you try to use it. Unfortunately there’s no teleport option or escape pods.This echo frequently gets stuck “On a Call” when it’s not. Often but not always because it crashes when in a dopin or call. The movement feature is cool until you realize it’s swings wildly from being too sensitive to not working at all.Basically this, along with a lot that Amazon has produced recently, are half-baked	2	September 8, 2022	0

220	echo show 10	I purchased this for my mother-in-law who has some dementia.  However, many of the screen images are just avertisements for add-on products that I can't stop her from seeing.  Yes, I can stop verbal sign-ups, but am not finding it effective.  And, to add insult to injury, I can't return it because I let her use it for too long.	1	September 7, 2022	0
221	echo show 10	I’ve had many alexa’s of all kinds. This newer version is not good.  She doesn’t hear her name…I’m basically yelling to get her to do things.  She doesn’t do about half of the commands I ask. I don’t know what’s happening over there but this is how I expected the 1st gen Alexa to perform.  This is the worst one…it should be much better.	2	September 6, 2022	0
222	echo show 10	I've had this device for a year and a half and it is terrible.  I thought it would get better as time went on but unfortunately, it is just as bad as when I purchased it.  I've completely disabled the motion because not only are the warning banners annoying, but most of the time I'm in one place and the screen thinks I'm somewhere completely different.  The voice recognition on this device is abismal.  I'd much rather use my Echo Show 8 or my dot before I use this one.  I don't understand the amount of positive reviews, maybe I just received one that was defective but I'm considering switching to Google thanks to this device.	2	September 6, 2022	0
223	echo show 10	We had a first gen Echo Show 6 which was purchased used to try out and see if we liked it.  Well, we loved it!  As it aged however it started acting up.  Because of the prominent placement of the device and its near constant use I thought it would be best to graduate to the Echo Show 10.  What a great move!  The screen is movable (tilting up and down) and if you leave the camera lens cover open, the screen will follow you around the room so you can always see the screen.  We chose to close the cover because that freaked us out a little.  Just the same, this thing is amazing!  The sound quality is right up there with Bose! We couldn't be more pleased with this purchase and the ease of setup.  You won't be sorry for purchasing this device!	5	September 6, 2022	1
224	echo show 10		1	September 6, 2022	0
225	echo show 10	Compared to the first gen show, this thing is a set back. It’s kinda neat that it will follow you around but the practicality for that just isn’t there. This show is so slow…soooo slow, It’s almost like they put a PlayStation 1 processor in it. And for some stupid reason it almost never hears us. And usually misses the wake word. Compared to the echo dots this thing sucks at hearing you. We usually end up shouting at it. There is a 95% chance I’m gonna use it with some tannerite for target practice. Might switch to google and see how those devices do.	1	September 6, 2022	0

232	echo show 10	I own many echo devices and this one by far is the worst.  The only good thing about It is the speaker.  Now that is awesome, but the unresponsive screen is just the pits.  Not to mention when it looks at you it is pointed away slightly which means, it is not centered on you, that is irritating, and often I close the camera so it won't move.  if you are close to it, it is facing away from you, what is the point in that? The follow feature is just ok.  The video quality is decent but its ability to stay connected to my wifi is the pits. My other Echo shows work flawlessly.	2	September 4, 2022	0

The skill doesn't link to your account, so it can't show your personal recipes.  In fact, it appears to be using a different DB than the allrecipes website, as a search on the show yields different results than the website.  Very disappointing.

I have had to restart several times just to get it to follow commands or play a tune or make a command it ignores my request I am very very disappointed in this set up.

247	echo show 10	The product is amazing. If you’re into tech or just need an extra screen by the kitchen counter it does the job but the Alexa integration is so SLOW for a product at this price tag. I had to reset to factory defaults twice since I bought it 3 months ago. Showing the Ring camera and controlling your smart home is just way too slow to be useful, most of the times I just open the app on my phone to make it quicker. Bummer that you can’t select the color of RGB smart lights! A lot of room for SOFTWARE improvement. The touchscreen is beautiful and responsive but everything else (and I’m talking about Alexa features like video calls) takes way too long and it’s unresponsive. Maybe a future update will fix it.	3	September 1, 2022	1

The device felt extra slow for a 3rd generation product; The touch screen is not always responsive. The settings menu freezes a lot; Sometimes it crashes and goes to idle or Screen Saver mode while I'm in the middle of interacting with the menu. It is not consistent with announcements, especially when someone is at my front door; Also the Camera does not always show an image of the front door. The front camera does not always recognize me (male) from everyone else in my house (all Women). I thought a New software update may be able to help but it was worst.

276	echo show 10	I use this regularly and it is good for older parents and kids. But it's so sloppily implemented, particularly around the basics. The response times are slow for core functions like starting or ending a call, and it is constantly fussing about its range of motion. When it works it's pretty amazing- tracks your voice and often makes very astute decisions about how to zoom, pan, etc. But, again, the basics are clunky and that's what I'm contending with most of the time.	2	August 25, 2022	0
277	echo show 10	Good screen and better voice recognition than other echo show devices. Motion following is a gimmick that doesn't work well and doesn't turn off when the motion off option is selected. Overall, far too much money for a slightly better echo show.

278	echo show 10	"Pretty much a useless overpriced piece of junk. What's the point of installing a tablet on an echo device if it doesn't do anything a touchscreen device from even 15 years ago could. Pretty lame. It has almost zero app support or usability. Even if you manage to get it to go to Amazon Prime or Netflix you can't properly navigate through it.How are they going to pretend you can use Netflix, Amazon Prime or other streaming services simply by talking to it but not being able to actually visually navigate through it in a reasonable manner?I use YouTube music, the only way to use it on the echo Show is to use it through the internet and it is so slow, laggy and glitchy it's not even worth using, it truly is that bad. Even if you use Amazon music you can't click on an album and see all the tracks it's virtually useless how am I going to look through my music by talking to it? There's no reason it can't allow you to navigate through your music by using the touch screen, it's absolutely terrible.This would be the equivalent of only being able to speak to your tablet then your tablet giving you very limited information based on what you asked, the whole point of the echo show is that you're supposed to also have touch screen and interface usability beyond just speaking to it.In Amazon's defense the only thing I can say is they did call it the Echo Show.There's no excuse it can't support any app or function as a tablet except they have gone completely out of their engineering it not to. You installed a tablet on the device, it should work as one but it doesn't so I see no point in its existence. I don't need a display to kind of show me what I asked with the least information given.Even the most mundane of tasks asking it the weather the best you get is the temperature as it shows the temperature on screen with zero other information or even something to click on to give you more, nothing. What do I need that for??I could look at my thermometer outside my window for that. What an absolute joke.It's just a $250 display that sits on my counter now. Great, thanks Amazon for manufacturing a useless device!!Another huge thing is for the amount of space there is for a speaker in the device it has subpar sound at best.I have speakers half the size of this that sound better with fuller sound and dynamic range.Seriously, this device was excessively ""dumbed down"".I wish I could send it back still and get my money back.Don't waste yours."	1	August 25, 2022	0

290	echo show 10	"The 3rd generation Echo Show 10 is worse at picking up voice commands, has worse audio, but the screen can be completely vertical which helps for video calling. Overall, I'm not happy upgrading from the 2nd gen to the 3rd gen.This version of the echo show 10 is objectively worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10 at picking up voice commands. This manifests itself in either doing nothing, hanging (taking 15 seconds or so for the blue ""listening"" stripe to disappear, where you can't interrupt it), or asking to repeat your command. It was so bad, I finally decided to return it, but realized I'm outside of the return window. Hence, this review instead.The sounds quality is also worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10. Specifically, voices in audio are just harder to hear from a few yards away compared to the 2nd generation. It feels like the audible spectrum gets distorted quite easily, even at lower volumes. Turning the volume up just gets cluttered and noisy.I bought this device for the sake of making video calling easier. The fact that the screen can be tilted and get completely vertical is great, as the last generation pointed upwards about about 10 degrees. When making calls with our kid, we'd have to prop up the back end of the 2nd gen Echo Show, and this devices solves that problem. It does this very well.I was going to gift my 2nd generation Echo Show 10 to someone, but I think I'm switching back to that and giving this one away. I'm pretty disappointed with this Echo."	2	August 22, 2022	0

Then Amazon sent only the Show and refunded me only the low “bundle” price for the Blink camera. That was, of course, not enough to buy it separately. Very bad business! What’s really aggravating is that I took the option of registering the devices to my account for easier setup.

He does not yet use words to communicate but will say words with a song. He is good with scrolling devices and can find his music that way. The screen moves and follows his movement around the room.

Half the time it doesn’t understand what I’m saying, it’s nerve racking.  Unfortunately, my return window has passed. The speaker’s good for music and the screen is nice. That’s the positive side…..	3	August 22, 2022	1

302	echo show 10	I upgraded my original version of the Echo Show with this model.  I find the camera, the screen and the sound to be great and definitely worth the upgrade.  And the ability the tilt the screen up and down is a big plus.  We have this in the kitchen/family room area which is open and the sound travels nicely around the space.  The people we have called on the device have all said how much better the camera is on their end.  The only thing that is still to be determined is the follow motion (circular path of the screen).  It took us a few uses to figure out that a ceiling fan and TV image was causing the focus to try to adapt and created some left and right rotation when we hadn't moved.  Once we isolated that, the feature is interesting, but we have not really found a need for it and have since disabled it.  I would not pay extra for the rotating screen feature, but the rest of the updated features are outstanding.	4	August 21, 2022	1

305	echo show 10	Update: I changed tatimg from two stars to one star. A kind representative called me based in my first review to try to fix said issues below.It worked for awhile but no more.I don't enjoy sports. I hay gone to settings and toggled off all sports-related content. Unplugged/replugged multiple times. Yet, the majority of content that comes across my Show screen is sports-related.Too late to send back. Clearly, though, the Show I received is faulty. I'm really ticked.————First, the motion ability is worthless. I wake up early in the morning. Echo let's me know there's not enough light for it to sensor motion despite having all living room lights on. As such, I disabled this feature.But what I'm most disappointed about is that when I upload my own pictures on the Alexa app, I have to unplug the device and plug back in for the new pics to show. Ridiculous.Next, when I saw the Show's speaker, I was excited thinking the sound would be superb. It's not. The sound sounds the same as the very first Show.I wish I would have kept my previous show. Lesson learned. I'd send this one back for a rwolacy but don't want to go through all the rigamarole.This Show isn't worth $250	1	August 21, 2022	0

315	echo show 10	Not bad as an alexa but the problem comes in when you try to multitask with this. For instance if you're watching Netflix and you ask it to turn off the lights it stops Netflix and you have to restart up Netflix to continue your movie.  Also if you have reminders set it overrides what you're currently doing such as watching a movie Etc. Sometimes you ask it to stop doing a task such as stop playing movie and it does not It still needs bugs worked out	3	August 20, 2022	1

317	echo show 10	I like it the big problem is where to put it. In the main living room or office. I'm in the office more so selected there. Works well and when the Ring has motion or person it will let me know. Can also view it from there. I do have a smart TV with Alexa which I can view Ring from the TV, so the office was the best choice. I do have to reset from time to time, not a big deal it comes back and works perfectly. As an update has improved since I modified my network. Looks to be on my side issue.	5	August 20, 2022	1

322	echo show 10	I had really high hopes for this Echo Show.  I traded in my Echo 8 that I really liked because I wanted more robust sound and features while I'm in the living room/kitchen area.  While I agree that the sound is better, I'm pretty disappointed in how slow the response and functionality is compared to my Show 8.  I'll call out for Alexa in the room and the other units in other rooms detect my voice and the Show 10 will respond a few seconds later or sometimes no response at all. I don't like the motion following me so that's disabled so it's mostly for the audio at this point, especially since there's no Youtube video integration with Alexa devices.  I still use it, but for the price I paid and getting rid of the Echo 8 has made me lose favor with the Show 10.	3	August 20, 2022	1

Not for me.	1	August 15, 2022	0
362	echo show 10	The device is helpful for all things related to Alexa, good with connecting to our Ring cameras, good with finding tasty new recipes and great with being a digital picture frame on a loop. I do wish it had additional video services - it does have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime and a few others but I'd like to see Apple+, Paramount+, Peacock and Sling added. The device has the ability to turn and face you no matter where you are in the room, which is nice sometimes but doesn't work as well if another person is in view. Also, since the camera isn't centered on the device, it seems like the tracking is sometimes a bit off. Overall, I'm happy with the device, especially the sound quality and volume.	4	August 15, 2022	1
363	echo show 10	Half the screen doesn't recognize when you're touching it. You ask it one thing and it answers something random like the local weather or something.

384	echo show 10	The Alexa Show 10 was really disappointing. Firstly, the stock photo showing the Home Screen with weather pinned to the side is just false advertising because that’s not something it can actually do, I even reached out to Amazon Tech Support to see if I was just missing something.. nope, they confirmed this product cannot do that. I was expecting a SMART interface where I could pin apps, sticky notes, reminders, holiday countdowns, etc.. but NO! This alexa does not have that capability, it is not customizable . If you have a lesser Alexa product like the dot, picture that capability but with a screen. It’s essentially a TV/Bluetooth speaker for your kitchen	2	August 13, 2022	0
385	echo show 10	Works really well especially when the screen can follow you around the room. Speaker is as good or better than the previous Show but you definitely need space around this Echo Show for it to properly rotate the screen and follow you.	5	August 13, 2022	1

You can only view the Live View over a wifi network. It doesn't have to be the same one. This is a inconvenience for me. And something worth noting prior to purchase.I can settle for it, as I am finding it useful for organizing my day, video chatting with family, dropping in, making announcements etc.Other than that tid bit, all works as advertised or described.Sometimes a factory reset (first option) does the trick in resolving any technical errors you may come across.	4	August 11, 2022	1
399	echo show 10	"I have various issues with this device.First is the way it reacts to ""show me how"" commands. Sometimes it will pull up a video on YouTube, and other times it will just pull up web options for you to tap on, which doesn't help when you have your hands in food.Second is the face tracking on this device. It always overshoots to the left because the camera is in the top right corner, and if you move your face in front of the screen, it will turn away from you. It also will occasionally lock onto something else when it overcompensates like a paper towel roll causing it to basically face the wall.Last complaint is the unnecessarily tedious process to use your own recipes in alexa. You have to manually go through and add them to the recipe database for Alexas ""all recipes"" app, and I haven't found a way to just import an existing recipe from other sites."	4	August 11, 2022	1

Luckily I paid around $80 after trade in etc etc etc. I do not think this device is worth more than $100 due to its poor performance.

411	echo show 10	My current echo show device is placed on a corner table between the sofa and recliner. I really liked the idea of display facing the person asking the question. However it fails to rotate unless you keep room lights on 24/7 (Low light warning). Doesn't rotate if the camera privacy window is closed. Gets confused about who asked the question if TV is on. Also places requested items in a small window example show Ring Front door bell and then asking to show a different device. So you have to reach over and close or maximize window. If I wanted to touch a display I can do that on my phone. This didn't happen on earlier models. Returning the item	3	August 9, 2022	1

413	echo show 10	I set mine up in the kitchen so I can talk to family or watch home improvement shows while I’m prepping and cooking.Just buy it!!!	5	August 9, 2022	1
414	echo show 10	It’s like Alexa on steroids love it love it love it. Get to talk to the grandbabies so clearly. Does everything prime and Alexa do not need another piece of equipment ever again	5	August 9, 2022	1
415	echo show 10	I like everything about it	4	August 9, 2022	1
416	echo show 10	buen sonido y calidad de imagen, hace muy bien el seguimiento pero con algunas limitaciones para reconocer entre una persona y otra (las confunde), me gustaría que Alexa no aceptara instrucciones o peticiones de cualquier persona.	5	August 9, 2022	1
417	echo show 10	So happy to get this unit for our kitchen. Had been looking at it for a while, we replaced our show 5! The upgrade to 10 was well worth it! Wish we had done it sooner.	5	August 9, 2022	1
418	echo show 10	It’s ok	3	August 9, 2022	1
419	echo show 10	I’m still learning on this but I love the help she gives	5	August 9, 2022	1
420	echo show 10	I like the movable tracking screen but other than that, it's just a tracking and movable screen and not much more advanced functionality-wise compares to its predecessor. The novelty wears off very quick	4	August 9, 2022	1
421	echo show 10	It keeps saying it's not on a flat surface and it's on my counter top also motion detection turns off because it can't find anyone 😒	1	August 9, 2022	0
422	echo show 10	This Echo Show 10 is a great assistant. Great sound when playing music, great quality when showing my pictures. It’s also a good way to see what’s happening at home. Just pick up your phone, tap your Alexa icon, ask to drop in at home, and see and hear your home space while on the phone. Good security!	5	August 9, 2022	1
423	echo show 10	I love it.	4	August 9, 2022	1
424	echo show 10	I use it primarily for music in my bedroom and the quality of sound is tremendous for 1 small speaker.	5	August 9, 2022	1
425	echo show 10	After a year of ups and downs, the downs are now far more than the perks. The microphone seems to be “going”, thus Alexa doesn’t hear your commands or hears what she wants to hear. The sound quality is quickly diminishing and there have been no significant upgrades or fixes during the time I’ve owned this device. I feel it’s money wasted.	1	August 8, 2022	0
426	echo show 10	Screen quality is great.  Sound is good also,  but Alexa doesn't always perform the tasks I ask.	4	August 8, 2022	1

431	echo show 10	Screen is great but Alexa seems to struggle with commands. This device replaced a 5th generation and sadly the Alexa is subpar	3	August 8, 2022	1
432	echo show 10	I love the convenience of having the tablet on the Alexa.  It makes using Pinterest recipes so much easier, creating shopping lists and any other kitchen task.  All the great Alexa things plus the tablet.  Love it!	5	August 8, 2022	1
433	echo show 10	I had a gen 1 show and it worked well for what i needed. Decent sound quality a big screen compared to my other devices a good microphone and ease of user interface. I wanted to step up to the next device that had improved screen, appearance and sound. It meets all of these expectations, but it doesn't blow me away in anyway. That is why i gave it a 4 rather than 5.	4	August 8, 2022	1
434	echo show 10	I'm really enjoying my Echo it fun to use. It worth it you'll enjoy it. Also the request for different request for recipes anything I can think of. Videos from my home is really clear too. Learning more usage of Echo I'm glad I purchase it.	5	August 8, 2022	1

436	echo show 10	Me and my husband really enjoy using echo show. We are using it mainly for the music. Love the lyric display so I can sing along with it when I wash dishes. Also connect with our ring security cameras. It send notifications when the ring camera detect any motion. It’s very convenient. Love it :)	5	August 8, 2022	1
437	echo show 10	Aún sigo probándolo y puedo decir que no me gusta que no es capa de conectarse con fire tv .eso para mi es un punto en contra ya que lo tengo puesto en mi sala y el enterito lo tenía conectado con mi tv para reproducir y ahora ya no puedo Pk este no se puede conectar con Fire tv ,haci  Que he perdido mi parlante ya no seré capas de escuchar mi tv a través  de el ,estoy era muy importante .el resto la instalación fue rápida y fácil .volveré si algo cambia para bien o para mal ,a dejarles otra reseña	3	August 8, 2022	1

443	echo show 10	I love the picture clarity; I can watch amazon prime movies and ABC news live; I can ask for recipes or the best way to remove rust from silver by just speaking the words.	5	August 7, 2022	1

445	echo show 10	The only thing I really didn’t like was whenever I went to plug it in the cord was white and it’s kinda hard to hide a white cord with the black Alexa .	5	August 7, 2022	1
446	echo show 10	Since installing our new Alexa Show 3rd generation, we've been disappointed with the response. The response is slower and the correct response is not as frequent.  It's been frustrating.  I do like the screen.  It is big and easier to see.	3	August 7, 2022	1
447	echo show 10	It all works pretty good except fo using the browser to search, im pretty disappointed with how difficult it was to search the web	4	August 7, 2022	1
448	echo show 10	I bought this version not realizing the motion detector would be so useful while cooking. It displays my recipe and always moves to face wherever I am in the kitchen. No more having to walk over just to see the recipe again!	5	August 7, 2022	1
449	echo show 10	This device is a good idea however it doesn’t work most times when using the “drop in” feature.  I have it at my Mom’s house to check in on her from a distance.  I use the drop-in feature because at this point the device is too complicated for her to use.  The problem with the feature is that when I end the connection on the Alexa app to the echo 10 the echo 10 does not hang up.  This prevents a new connection next time I try to drop-in.  The only solution is to get in my car and drive there to press the screen’s red “end icon”.  Once that is done I can then initiate a new “drop in” call.  This seems to be an easy fix for the programmers at Amazon.  Just have the echo 10 timeout the “drop in” call if there are no activities from the caller.  Yes, I chatted with their tech support.  About 12 of them.  Annoying as hell.  You just get passed on from one tech person to another tech etc.  with no one knowing what to do. I felt I knew more about the echo 10 then amazon’s tech support.  All 12 of them. It’s a shame.  And being an engineer I certainly know more about solving problems than all of them.  I am going to keep the device because it does save me one daily trip.  Drop in, works at lease once a day after my drive there to touch the “end” call icon.  However the product truly is not ready for prime time.  If 12 Amazon techs and me (engineer), and many hours chatting with them cannot resolve the problem. The echo 10 needs much more bug fixes.	3	August 7, 2022	1
450	echo show 10	This is by far been the most disappointing purchases I’ve made.Long time alexa fan and own over 5 different devices across the home. If you’re looking to automate your home and/or have a multi room sound system, I HIGHLY recommend that you DONT choose alexa.Unfortunately, this has been a rare product that gets worse with time - strictly talking software and functionality not hardware.Owning echos for about 3 years now, the first year was great and since then the software, app, connectivity between Alexa’s and functionalities have géstela deteriorated.I’ve tried everything to reset, update, to no avail. Software is just not Amazons strong suit and it clearly shows. I’ve spent hours with customer service agents trying to help and it boils down to they don’t know how to “fix it” or will pass it on to developers. Aka, yeah sucks it happened but thanks for buying though! Now, I will say they’ve been kind and tried to help but it’s just a poor quality product.From constant music issues, to alexa devices turning on and off on its own, regression in functionalities, I regret having dove in deep to the alexa ecosystem.For my offices I’ve since switched to other home devices as tests and so far so good. It’s safe to say I will be switching over to a different home automation system	1	August 7, 2022	0

452	echo show 10	All the problems we had with our original Echo (not a ton but big enough to be slightly annoying at times) are now incorporated into a device with a screen and it’s own additional glitches and not so user friendly. :|	3	August 7, 2022	1
453	echo show 10	Alexa integration is lacking. Has difficulty following commands.	3	August 7, 2022	1

456	echo show 10	The screen motion supper special m’y when u are in video call and u move while ur chatting so it will follow , the only thing I didn’t like that the integration with alexa , cz Alexa better on echo 4th and even echo dot the old one	5	August 6, 2022	1
457	echo show 10	I love that I can get any information I need as well as watch shows I like and listen to music by just asking Alexa.	5	August 6, 2022	1
458	echo show 10	I like that it could play music while I cook and offer recipes.	5	August 6, 2022	1

460	echo show 10	I really do love this. I can find recipes, play music, and make lists all at once.	5	August 6, 2022	1
461	echo show 10	The voice recognition is not nearly the quality of our other Show’s. Very disappointing consider the price point. We have completed all  the voice prompts twice and it still isn’t any better.	3	August 6, 2022	1
462	echo show 10	It works great with the premium echo dot in a group.	5	August 6, 2022	1

465	echo show 10	My wife and I are really pleased and really enjoying it, but we had several issues during setup, saying it didn't go smootly is to go short, it got stuck 3 times during the process, we had to unplug it and plug it again, the first time we though it had issues with the distance from the main wifi router, but then we did the rest of the setup with the wifi router right next to it, it got stuck a couple of more times, and we had to unplug/plug it two more times.	4	August 6, 2022	1
466	echo show 10	When I bought this echo, I was thinking is a full service android with possibility to have Skype on it and talk with family, because this is showing in the advertising video. But unfortunately it doesn’t have skype and you can not install it. Is hard in instruction and only I can use it for now when some one rings my doorbell and kid’s watch some videos, but same thing can do the iPad which have more functions.This is more like design bot utility.	1	August 6, 2022	0
467	echo show 10	I like how quick it responds voice commands	5	August 6, 2022	1
468	echo show 10	It’s much bigger than I had expected and the speaker on it is amazing. We bought it for our kitchen so we could listen to music or watch our favorite shows while we cook and it has been exactly what we needed.	5	August 6, 2022	1
469	echo show 10	The screen is brilliant,  the tracking feature allows me to move around the room while the device rotates to keep me in the video call.  It does all the skills every other echo does.It fails epically to allow for permitted contacts as well as myself while away,  to drop in on the device.  If there is no work around,  a refund will be forthcoming.	2	August 5, 2022	0
470	echo show 10	I'm happy with it but wish it had more live channels like News etc. I really love the feature that follows you around and zooms in, especially when I drop in to other echo shows for example with my mom overseas or with my son in college. I know, there's apps like FaceTime and WhatsApp that work really well but my mom is really old and this device allows me to video call without her lifting a finger.	4	August 5, 2022	1
471	echo show 10	The whole family loves it. My kids can answer the doorbell without having to be near the front door. My wife and kids all love listening to music, the sound quality is excellent.	5	August 5, 2022	1
472	echo show 10	This device has a 10 inch rotating screen, speakers with subwoofer, and an integration hub.  No other Alexa device has all three.  That makes this the most feature-rich device, currently.  It works surprisingly well with one small exception.  The screen rotates to track you during video calls, video streaming, music, and more.  However, it could be a bit more sensitive or precise.  We have a larger kitchen and it is relatively easy to step outside the tracking range.  When this happens the screen can stall at a position that is less than optimal.  Otherwise, it is a great device and we continue to learn new skills everyday.	4	August 5, 2022	1
473	echo show 10	We are loving the Echo Show 10. The sound and screen quality are awesome. Working with Alexa is great. However, the part where the show follows you is a little off at times. If you go out of the area where it can see you, a message pops up on the screen every single time. Kinda annoying. Maybe there is a setting to change that. Also, doesn't always pick up when it's supposed to follow you. But most the time it works well.	4	August 5, 2022	1
474	echo show 10	The Echo show is not really bad, but it keeps losing connecting to the net and you have to unplug it and then reboot for it to reconnect.	4	August 5, 2022	1
475	echo show 10	Great sound quality and the screen is a good size. It’s annoying sometimes if the kids move it and it says we moved out of the range set but it’s really not that big of a deal. Overall we are very happy with this purchase	5	August 4, 2022	1
476	echo show 10	It’s a beautiful picture quality. The sound is okay and it doesn’t really follow me me like it should. Finding it pretty difficult to do video calls the quality is… I should have kept my other Echo show🤷🏾‍♀️	4	August 4, 2022	1
477	echo show 10	It is Inconvenient unit to have but it does severely struggle to accurately respond the voice commands and my current unit seems to move incredibly slow	4	August 4, 2022	1
478	echo show 10	Great audio and screen but it’s been having a poor time picking up my voice commands. Not sure how I can help this. Hopefully a future update can resolve.	3	August 4, 2022	1

487	echo show 10	Roomie got this 'thing' from a friend as a gift. Not sure why, long standing. As special bulbs had to be 'ordered' just to make it work. Well, that was the easy part.... talk about a huge waste of energy, and time. It doesn't respond half the time to voice commands. Which is more than beyond irritating. .. Don't blame it on poor wiring.  It's technology with too many bugs to bother with.  Be glad when I move out... and use real light switches again.	1	August 4, 2022	0
