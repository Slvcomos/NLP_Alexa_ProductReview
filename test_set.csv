16	Echo Dot	Wonderful device for the money	Until I purchased this Dot, I only had used Google. I like my Dot better since it hears me all the time and answers each question promptly. It's small, but powerful. It has a great selection of music and there was only one time it didn't have what I asked for.

34	Echo Dot	Alexa, what is the weather	I haven‚Äôt had Amazon/Google products as much as Apple, but Alexa is cool!

37	Echo Dot	Some minor bugs but OK overall	"A good addition to a room where I want to listen to music/the news or may have general questions every now and then, BUT Alexa still has issues understanding what we say or what we ask (we have to adapt the way we ask questions to the phrasing she recognizes) sometimes or comes on with a comment/answer (""Sorry, I don't know the answer to that one"" ... when we didn't ask anything ...) without any prompt or freezes altogether... Overall, it  happens rarely, so we can live with it, but it's annoying when you need something right there and then and she goes  in tilt mode or she starts playing the wrong song and you have to tell her to stop 5 times before she does."	4	October 22, 2022	Calafia	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHYKTNMTZCNAU5ZWRQJQGT7BR3KA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

44	Echo Dot	Pretty cool tech	Pretty cool technology. I use the Echo Dot mostly for news and music and to keep track of orders. Sound quality could be better for music. Not sure if that's due to the smaller speaker, or the fact the music is digital, but some songs sound a little off. I typically listen to 80's new wave music and the synth sounds on some songs sound different. Overall, love the product and use it all the time.	5	October 22, 2022	Jeff McManigal	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHXIPSTBBTFCASMYV5XDJLSCEKMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

47	Echo Dot	works as it should	i think overall i am happy with this. though, i got this [on a huge sale] primarily to voice-activate music and listen to it in my bedroom; in that regard, the speakers are only OK for music and for some videos on other streaming services the sound is quite poor and/or muddled in my opinion. but again, Alexa + other functions work very well, so maybe i was expecting too much---especially given the cheap price.	4	October 22, 2022	glen_‚ò≠	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFRJMD52TPHJO7AQLROA3NRFZEVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

49	Echo Dot	Mostly Great	I got this with the intention to use it in my kitchen to listen to podcasts while cooking a cleaning. The sound quality is not perfect, but acceptable. However the whole reason I wanted an Echo for the kitchen was so that I could tell Alexa to fast forward or rewind, and those voice commands don‚Äôt work.

66	Echo Dot	Hey Alexa!	I always said I would never fall for the tech hype but I honestly love this thing. It does it all, seriously.

75	Echo Dot	Pro‚Äôs and con‚Äôs	All in all it‚Äôs a quality device. I also have a gen1 dot and sphere in my condo. All three have the same issue where it won‚Äôt always recognize the initial ‚Äúwake up command,‚Äù so you end up yelling at it. Another annoyance is the group speaker option. Far too often one of them, if not all three, will stop playing and emit a white noise sound, or glitch the playback with a loud high pitch crackle. It‚Äôs really quite annoying and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be any way to fix the issue.There‚Äôs other little things, but at the end of the day it is what it is. I still use them and have no intention of switching to a different system/ platform anytime soon.	4	October 21, 2022	Brian Stanley	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF5S3N7MPENKGEAMI7QBBUS44UMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

79	Echo Dot	Excelente para iniciar en la dom√≥tica y la asistencia virtual	Es un buen producto si buscas escuchar m√∫sica en cualquier lugar de su casa u oficina, la interacci√≥n con ella es de mucho aprendizaje sobretodo  a la hora de darle un comando, se necesita mucha paciencia para convivir con ella.La mayor√≠a de los casos entiende exactamente lo que le pides, pero es frecuente que no te entienda correctamente o no lo haga de plano.Puedes alternar entre Ingl√©s y Castellano y te va a entender sin problemas.El mayor problema es la APP de Alexa, es bastabte complicada y se necesita mucha configuraci√≥n que se desconfigura con frecuencia, muchas veces te indica que puedes controlar un dispositivo pero en relidad no lo hace.Hay que tener especial cuidado con el nombre que se le da a los dispositivos conectados con Alexa, ella no los reconoce facilmente como deber√≠a.Es amable y es ideal para pasar un rato con la familia o amigos en una fiesta, todos pidiendole lo que sea y riendose de sus errores, facilmente te saca un sonrisa.Dise√±ada para ofrecerte los servicios de Amazon constante e incistentemente, es lo peor de ella.De vez en cuando vas a tener que reiniciarla.En general funciona para lo que fue contruida, no me arrepiento de mi compra, solo que hay que tenerle mucha paciencia, tampoco es una aparto que te va a solucionar la vida, s√≥lo te la facilita en algo.	4	October 21, 2022	Sergio Cordova	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGVPLHXJA2CYTLKMCR374EQE5IZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

84	Echo Dot	Brought so much laughter to my home.	I bought this device so I can contact my kids while I work when they aren't answering their phones. Unfortunately, I got covid and haven't been able to test it out for the purpose that I bought it for. However, Alexa has been insanely helpful for so many things like recipes, jokes, keeping a shopping list for the house, playing our favorite tunes, and being able to deliver messages through the device while I isolate in my bedroom. Last night I heard my boys to play a string of 100 fartsü§¶ They have had so much fun having this device around and I absolutely love it!

88	Echo Dot	Stupid speaker	Horrible integration with their own Amazon music (unlimited subscription) app which can't cast to the device. Thought of using the cast feature because the bad recognition system doesn't understand what I'm trying to make it play in the first place. Alexa app is another level of stupidity. It has a play tab but you can't search from there and even can't play anything at times as it keeps crashing. Ridiculously buggy piece of software.

95	Echo Dot	Great sound for such a little guy!!	I love my Echo Dot! I keep this one by my bed so when I read at night, I can have Alexa play my violin music to relax to at the end of the day.. HOWEVER... When I'm 'stress cleaning' I pair it w/ my Echo that's upstairs and blast my 80's hair bands all over the house!This little gem can definitely put out some sound!At night, while reading, I can keep it on volume 1 or 2 and it's sufficient. So that tells you how strong of a sound can come out!Plug and play. Connects right to your main Echo if you have one. Download the Alexa app for navigating.I will be at work and can turn on music for my dogs when I know a storm is coming through. (Pro tip: play 'The Thunder Rolls' by Garth Brooks enough times, and that should help desensitize your dogs to the sound of thunder!! Worked for us!)Easy to dust off with a damp cloth.Great for finding out answers to random questions. Asking about the weather.. the news..translate words or phrases... Receive your Amazon shopping notifications or if a new book comes out or music by a favorite artist.OR, if you are my husband and my teenage son, you can have Alexa make fart noises. ~sigh~The possibilities are endless...

173	Echo Dot	A powerful little connected speaker	I've been using the echo dot for several years now, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of bells and whistles, so I don't need to upgrade to the latest and greatest. This model has a nice physical button to stop the device speaker from active listening, and has a surprising range and volume when listening to music, or asking for a daily update (news).I do not have any smart home devices to integrate with this yet, but feel like it would work really well with them once it's set up.I have used this with both Amazon music unlimited, and Pandora premium. I've also used this with Spotify premium. Every service so far has worked well.I've also combined this with another echo dot, and through the app have been able to play music through both at once with a single voice command, or a single click of the button in app. This definitely creates a neat music listening experience when walking around the your space.If you're looking for a low cost smart speaker, this is definitely a safe bet.	5	October 17, 2022	J Finch	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHDKYMZO3BBJ2C644FQOVYKRAZQA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

192	Echo Dot	I DON'T KNOW THAT  ( HANG UP)	I had one of these before and loved it, this one I can't understand what she says and I ask her to play music from my prime music, she wants to charge me 14.00 or I say play something calm or soothing for sleep she says I don't know or maybe you'll like this and puts on some really loud hard rock. I try again and again and again but can't get her to play soft music, or soothing music, help me fall asleep, play nature sounds, ocen sounds and I end up with hard rock.

216	Echo Dot	This bottom line introduction to echo can be passed up	This is the entry level, Echo to the entire Amazon echo world. However, you will be very bitterly disappointed at this entry-level speaker. The sound is truly awful and it mimics that of a very cheap speaker. It is almost impossible to hear the speaking voice for directions and request by ALEXA. Any type of music has muffled sound very very poor mid range if any mid range at all. This is the worst sound from the worst speaker you will ever hear. If you are interested in getting into the a LEX a world by an echo that is a step up from this one.

256	Echo Dot	Having problems with the GE multi color bulbs....	I am having problems with the GE lights and Alexa system.  The lights in one room come on when they should not. In another the bulbs will not pair with Alexa, and the app is very difficult, in my opinion, to navigate when working on lights, switches, etc.  I don't have a solution yet, but my off hand opinion is the bulbs are not stable and resetting them for pairing with Alexa is a pain. You have to turn the bulb off for 2 seconds, on  for 8 seconds and do this over and over for 6 times. Seems to me there could have been a reset button on the base of the bulb... just saying...  I really want this system to work, but I have my doubts. My guest room light comes on some time during the night, and I have a guest coming on Sunday, so I will have to revert back to the old bulbs until I find a solution(s) as I don't want his lights coming on while he is sleeping. I do not wish to alienate a good friend.	3	October 14, 2022	Amazon Customer	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF2TIP3P4LNFDGCF4JPZEYOJXPDA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

I do not have children to check there home work, but with alexa I could. But If the children knows, they could use this device to do there home work for them.

269	Echo Dot	Just buy a Google Home device	Alexa app is a pain to use. Too many notifications about what you can so with it popping up. Alexa can‚Äôt distinguish between smart plugs named ‚Äúlights‚Äù and smart bulbs. Terrible sound quality. I‚Äôll never buy any Alexa enabled device in my life ever again. Although I‚Äôm not a fan of Google, at least Google Home assistant is more intelligent and easier to use (yes, you can simply say ‚Äúall lights on‚Äù and Google will turn on everything even if it has ‚Äúlights‚Äù in name). It feels like an Amazon spy in your house. Wanna buy more toilet paper? Alexa will interrupt and tell you that. Sorry Amazon, I‚Äôm not interested. Even Bluetooth sucks, because there is no way to lower Alexa‚Äôs voice and increase bluetooth volume (and yes I increased volume on my phone).

I have tried unplugging it and resetting it several times but the red light won‚Äôt turn off.  Not only is it annoying, but it causes the echo to get warm since it is constantly on 24/7.

334	Echo Dot	Not 5g compatible	I wasted a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my ECHO device connected to my 5g wifi internet. After some research, some online forums suggested splitting my 5g internet (to 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands) to try to get the ECHO to connected. That did not work either. What a waste of time and money. Amazon needs to provide an update to my ECHO device so that those of us with 5g can connect it. Now I just have a paper weight.	1	October 13, 2022	anonymous	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEZFE2CF4EY5AEAJPH4ED4YYZ2JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0
335	Echo Dot	A great little personal assistant!	This is way more fun than I expected. I dont use a lot of smarthome features, but now that I'm getting used to Alexa, things are about to change. Really convenient way to listen to tunes while I'm working on the computer or playing on my phone. I use it a lot for simple questions and information too. Im going to order some smart light bulbs soon so I can make her do even more for me. Haha My major complaint is that I can't use it to call or text someone unless they sign up with the Alexa app too. That's a loss of a whole star there, because Google smart devices do that just fine with my Samsung Galaxy devices. Ive got other speakers that are better sounding, but as far as convenience goes, this little Echo is great for me. It sits right beside my recliner on a table where I embarrassingly spend most of my time. There has never been a problem of hearing it or not hearing me. The reminders arw handy too. I've been dabbling with the shopping lists feature too. I expect to use this more and more but really wish I could call and text my peeps with her.	4	October 13, 2022	Kimberley	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH6BRVAHRR6BF54RCMDYWIFZVGVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1
336	Echo Dot	Mine was rude	So mine had a tone and would make me repeat stuff... and the commercials on my tv was going to what it was saying... like a demon. I hit it with a hammer threw it away. I paid $1 on a discount also... was $50 on sale for $1 with 1 month of amazon music... which by the way doesnt link youtube videos on the xfinity flex amazon music app... alexa also wasnt compatible with the xfinity flex box...The box also is sturdy and hard to damage and makes u angry cus it was being rude and controlling my tv commercials being creepy and demonic... I hate amazon now...I want a refund and explanation kinda scary.	1	October 12, 2022	Travis Blackston	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFCBOVIXSZKNHF44Y7W5UFPSVI3Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

353	Echo Dot	Small, aesthetically pleasing in the room	I like the size of it, makes it so you don't have to make the Alexa your main personality of a room. However, it's not very good at picking up commands from a distance, and though it has gotten better via software updates, it still doesn't always get the command right. I think the worst part though, is the sound quality. If you have an Alexa you better plan to get some sort of external speaker, because the Alexa's speaker is not great.	4	October 11, 2022	Garrett	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHZOJQDTMJ6WIHY2RV7PB6K5TG7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	False	1

390	Echo Dot	Wow! Truly Amazed!	First of all, I can only say wow. This echo dot has revolutionized my day. I use it all the time to listen to my favorite music, listen to audiobooks, and find out any information I may need to know, (such as the weather, and measurement conversions). Alexa is very responsive and will almost always respond immediately when I call out for her. The only thing I wish could be improved could be the bass in the speaker, but the speaker itself can get very loud and maintain good audio quality. Overall, I really do believe that every home could use an Alexa, and mine has definitely improved my life.	5	October 10, 2022	Ajet J.	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHCOCFB6Q3UUXR7PGQBUSUQN53TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

406	Echo Dot	good device. Sky‚Äôs the limit for such a powerful device!	Since I purchased my echo dot, I found it very responsive, easy to operate, and more reliable than my homepod minis. I have four hompods and four echo dots. If for some reason, my wifi glitches, my homepods reconnect to my home wifi easly. My homepods, however, is another story. They are inconsistent with reconnecting to wifi, and home kit integration needs improvement. So I use my echo dots everywhere in my house. For audiobooks, music, and even telling me the weather and time. The best part is value. I paid $99 for a homepod while the echo dots never coated over $39. Apple better figure it out or I'm ditching their expensive echo system.	5	October 9, 2022	Reggie Townsend	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG67BLS5GS4TQMLDP44BLAVVJMKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

The response time is also immediate, and the commands work immediately as well. I have smart outlets in my home and used to use the google to turn them on, I didn't think there was a lag between the command and the action until I set it up with the echo.

435	Echo Dot	Alexa is now annoying as h‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.	The Alexa devices used to be OK.  Now, every time you ask her something, she has to go on and on with By The Way‚Ä¶..Example.  Alexa set timer for 8 minutes.  She responds with ‚ÄúSetting timer for 8 minutes.  By the way, if you need to add time to the timer, just say add two minutes to timer. ‚Äú  And, this is after I have a routine that runs daily to tell her to Stop By The Way, which she has to acknowledge with ‚ÄúOK.  I will pause my suggestions for now.‚ÄùThere is no known way to stop all this extra talk.  Obviously, the developers do not use this crap in their homes, or they would have a way to disable it.  Maybe they do have a way to turn this crap off, but they will not tell us.You will even get reminders to reorder something that you never ordered.  Someone else in the house, that is not on my Amazon account ordered it, but not me.

446	Echo Dot	Great all around!	Small and discreet. This is my second Echo Dot, the first is generation 1 and still works great. I got this so I could move the other into my workshop, I use it to listen to the news, control lights, and as an intercom between my workshop and upstairs.

463	Echo Dot	Good device, but the overall experience was a bit glitchy. REad on!	"So I ordered this as part of a Prime promotion, where they packaged it with the smart bulbs.  Fine enough, I already have some Alexa devices and know how the process works. Where things got complicated is when I traded in an earlier Alexa. I was supposed to get a 25% credit towards a new Alexa device. Seems straightforward.  The problem is that the 25% was never applied. I chatted with customer service. The rep was very professional and helpful, but I was told that because it was bundled with the free smart bulbs, it didn't count as a new Alexa device.  I wasn't convinced. Needless to say, it wasn't worth a few bucks credit to spend much time on this, but it is worth my time to write this review to inform you of my experience.  Overall I enjoy Amazon and all their cool stuff, and don't mind giving up some level of privacy to have this stuff.  But this review speaks to something larger.  Some things such as this (and occasional pricing 'hiccups' at the Amazon Fresh store) really cut to the heart of the ""trust"" and ""transparency"" relationship with Amazon. I always check my receipts when walking out of an Amazon Go store.  I would highly recommend that you do the same. As one U.S. President recently said, ""trust but verify"".  Big tech is here to stay, but we need to hold these companies accountable.  Thanks for reading, and have a blessed day."	4	October 7, 2022	Bud Fox	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEGHUHDDUJEQPJURKK6LHQZV7JQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

479	Echo Dot	If you're thinking of buying a 4th Gen, get this instead	We have quite a large number of Echo devices in our home, acting as a sort of whole-home communication and entertainment tool. Got a 4th Gen last year and we thought it was good. Got two 3rd Gens this year on pre-Prime Day sale, and I now wish we had never purchased the 4th Gen. The 3rd gen has AMAZING stereo quality sound, crystal clear. You can hear bass and treble perfectly balanced and equalized. No muffling, no tinny sound, it's perfect. The mic, unlike the mics in our Flex, Show, and 4th Gen devices, actually understands what we are trying to say and never makes us repeat or misinterprets. I wish I had gone for the 3rd gens all along.	5	October 6, 2022	Keri Stucker	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEAEWBJLWVJZQXNIHPQHGRMZFJKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1
480	Echo Dot	Really handy and fun	I didn‚Äôt think I would use the echo as much as I do.

In the morning I get a whole good morning message LOL. I tell Alexa to play radio stations for me & almost anything you can think of including turning on TV, running my irobot, etc. This echo can do so much for a little speaker.

495	Echo 4th Gen	The learning curve	The learning curve for me was learning how to talk correctly to Alexa to achieve expected results is ongoing.  You speak correctly = you get your results, but until you say it the way Alexa will recognise it = frustration.  However, all in all, yes I would recommend and if gifting,  make sure the person receiving has a lot of patience.  I do see the benifits associated with having an Echo once the learning curve has been navigated.  Hope this helps someone.	5	October 23, 2022	'Dwina	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGGOJ54AWUBEKDYS2QV2HWCMS3MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

500	Echo 4th Gen	Spoiled by Amazon devices easy setup	Maybe Amazon does it on purpose.  Bought the original Echo Plus years ago and, boy, did it get used in this family of nine.  Daughter mentioned it was finally showing its age (like me) so I got the newer one, plugged it in and that was it.  I plugged it in.  It automatically connected to Wifi and our Prime account and found all the other devices and kind of shooed me away when I was waiting to see what would happen.  Same with smart plugs.  Had an old Wemo and plugged it in and ran into all kinds of problems and instructions just to get it working with the Wemo app much less Alexa.  Swapped the Wemo plug with an Amazon plug and that's all it took.  Immediately showed up in my Alexa app.Yep.They're doing it on purpose.	5	October 22, 2022	Scott Betts	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE2XWMQM5SIH3YNDEAQWW2YFKCXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

526	Echo 4th Gen	Love It/Hate it at times....Voice recognition problems!	I will start off on a good note:  The sound is so much better than the previous generations.  However....As you can see there are two devices in the photo.  The one on the right is the original purchased, the one of the left was the used one I was sent to replace the one I am having problems with.  Clearly the replacement one was used, it has a small faded stain on it.  The issues I am experiencing involves the voice recognition.  I can say its name and it does not respond, sometimes I will have to raised my voice to a yell for it to hear me which does not work well when others are sleeping.  Other times, my older generation device in my bedroom responds and there is a wall between me and it.  I am sitting aprx 8-10 ft away from the device and it does not hear!  Sometimes when I ask it for my notifications, the one in the bedroom answers me thru the wall which of course I can't hear the notification!  They are going to send me a third one, due to the fact the replacement one I received was used.  Hopefully, the third time is the charm!  Aside from the issues with this particular device, I have always loved my Echo Dots.	3	October 17, 2022	Shoptilyoudrop	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AENLS7IGYOBXB5FYP6HPXECFVGMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

554	Echo 4th Gen	Still great but not as good as Gen 3, plus an unexpected issue	When Amazon allowed grouping and pairing, we went crazy with Gen 3 Echoes through our whole house. We love them. So we decided to finally try the newest version in our kitchen. Overall, still great. But not as good as generation 3 units. First, don't worry about the directional speaker if you put these against a wall already. It still fills the room with sound. But here's what isn't as good: voice activation doesn't seem as tight as gen 3. I'm a composer and sound guy and while the low might be a bit better here over gen 3 but the rest of the sound just isn't as full as as the previous version. Gen3 is just a richer sound. Finally, and something I didn't see coming, the new shape. People can debate if they like it or not, but having it out for just a few days, and because the whole top is speaker mesh, you get finger prints from the buttons and dust and other air-gunk gets stuck on it and it can't be wiped away because, well, it's speaker mesh. This is going to be a big deal over time as this isn't going to look good in a year from now, where gen 3 could just be wiped off. I hope the next version abandons this current globe design, simply for this reason.	4	October 14, 2022	B.

It should definitely be black. Notice in the ads where you show photos of all of them, that the white one is shown with the white cord and so is the twilight blue but the Charcoal 4th Gen Alexa is not shown with a cord at all, leaving the impression that the cord would certainly be black. Definitely do NOT like the white cord with the Charcoal Alexa. Wrong place to skimp - a bit deceiving.	4	October 11, 2022	Sheila Champlin	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGSVI37BHXVYQRRCIT5VHVS3QKRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

581	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is amazing.	Years ago, I started with the Echo Dots.  The little hockey pucks.  Not used for music but for a virtual assistant, controlling smart lighting and also controlling my TV's Firestick that tunes over-the-air television through my Recast.  I loved it.  But then I got an Echo Show for the kitchen and I really enjoyed playing music on it while cooking.  The sound quality was ok.  Nothing to brag about.  Then I decided to upgrade my hockey pucks to the newer full size Echos.  I bought two Echos and placed one in the bedroom and one in the living room.  I would play music through them and the sound quality was very surprising.  So then I decided to get one more for the back porch.  That evolved into wanting another for the porch that I could pair to the other.That's when everything changed for me!  When you pair two of them together and set it up as a stereo pair; it is really amazing.  I sit outside now and I listen to music (in stereo!) on the porch.  The bass can be felt in my chair.  I'm so impressed.  I have 5 acres and with the volume turned up to 7, I can hear the music just about anywhere on my property.I plan on getting more Echos and enhancing the music when I listen to it inside the house.  I have the Bose 700 Soundbar and Subwoofer in my living room.  It sounds great for movies, TV and music.  But I prefer the Echos when listening to music.  Its perfect.  I can have Echos placed around the house and have music playing softly and you can hear it everywhere.I'm very impressed.	5	October 10, 2022	Registered Coonass	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFEIF4Z5VJO3PEEE7Q5LWCSI3U2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1
582	Echo 4th Gen	Casi perfecto	A este equipo si pudiera solo le diera 3.5 estrellas, pero esto no se puede.Este producto como pongo mas arriba esta rosando la perfecci√≥n, pero... tiene un problema muy desagradable y es el siguiente, me he pedido dos echo 4ta para crear un cine en casa junto a un Fire TV 4K HDR, sucede lo siguiente: la calidad de audio directamente pedido a las bocinas via alexa es superior por mucho al audio que se reproduce desde el fire tv sincronizado con los echo 4ta, la musica suena hermosa, suena perfecta desde alexa, pero cuando veo una pelicula debo subir el volumen al maximo para apenas escuchar. sucede lo mismo si reproduzco musica en la app nativa de amazon music en el fire tv, el audio se siente de menor calidad a la que me ofrece cuando lo pido directo al asistente y tambien se siente que suena  menos.Estoy mas que satisfecho con la calidad de audio de estas bocinas cuando escucho musica desde Alexa, voy a comprar el echo sub de todos modos y esperemos que en futuras actualizaciones Amazon solucione este problema.	4	October 10, 2022	Alberto Bourdierd	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH25IQ3QUH6266LQPWMAVDCPKG5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

589	Echo 4th Gen	Very Poor	The main reason I bought this was for my husband. My husband has a hard time hearing when we use the TV built-in speakers especially when the show has music that is so loud it drowns out the voices. I hooked it up paired it through the Alexa app, and changed the preferred speakers to Echo, and still, the TV sound would not come out of the Echo. I called support and after she put me on hold several times, she came back and had me blue-tooth the Echo to the TV through the Settings menu. After that, the sound did come out of the Echo, but the sound quality is so quiet I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it, which made it still not as loud as the TV speakers. With the volume all the way up, Alexa is extremely loud. I called tech support again to ask if there is a way to turn down just Alexa's voice so it is not booming. There is not. One more note...Echo Alexa does not always understand commands. You have to say, Alexa, turn on FireTV...because if you say Turn on the TV, it just says that feature is not available...or something to that effect. Pretty awful. Returning it.	1	October 8, 2022	Meshel	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFRCB52QPLUHFMYLND2GWV5XXMJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

601	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound for a smallish device	Bought this to replace my old Echo Dot.  The sound is richer and it is not too large to be obtrusive on my desk.  Deducted a couple of stars as it fails in the same place that my other Echo devices do, speech recognition and command execution.  I am a fan of the Echo/Alexa platform, and I expect it to improve, but as of now, it just isn‚Äôt as good as I want it to be.  Expect to spend a fair amount of time arguing with the device (trust me you will never win), and reviewing your voice history.  Keep the software up to date always as updates do bring improvements, although sometimes they seem to break things as well.

But don't believe it; mine sucks. Sound is poor and muffled. When it plays music, music can barely be heard. When Echo is speaking, it is LOUD. Also, voice-recognition sucks. ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" Alexa: ""It is 7:04pm now."" And that is when it actually hears me (I have to SHOUT). After four generations, Amazon devices have gotten worse, not better.

614	Echo 4th Gen	Great choice of color	I bought my first echo3 on a deal and loved the functions it did to ease my life. It's the little things to turn on off lights, ask time and temp, play music, and most of all to read a book for me from my Amazon library. When echo4 had a deal I got it with lights for my granddaughter for music as it said improved speakers. That will be her birthday gift. I noticed then the newer echo4 with hub control for sale and upgraded. I put the older one in my kitchen as it still works great. I haven't a home full of Alexa enabled apps but I thought why not for a better quality sound. I haven't gone into the hub or ultrasound abilities yet but the sleep sounds I listen too at night is far improved. I like the look too. I did blue to keep them figured out if I get more for another room later. So far the only irritating thing is I have to repeat myself for Alexa to start playing something but it did that with echo3. I'm assuming it's the not perfect part of technology of humans. It improves each generation mayhap.

One of them stopped listening to my commands at one point- Amazon replaced it with a new one no questions asked. I still haven't returned it, but they haven't really bothered me about it.

627	Echo 4th Gen	Amazing but wonky setup	I was looking for a soundbar system for my livingroom. While I was doing some research, I saw a huge sale on the Echo for $59. For the price of a budget soundbar system, I was able to buy two echos and an Echo Sub.The software is wonky and frustrating to use sometimes. It took a half hour for the it to recognize the Echos as a stereo pair. Once they did, I was able to set them up in seconds. After that, I set it up with the Fire Stick as a home theater. The Echo sub hadn't even arrived yet. The sound is actually pretty amazing. The speakers sound crystal clear and provide competent bass. Music listening is where these speakers REALLY shine. There is a huge difference when you listen to music in true stereo.Going back to the software, That's why it's 4 stars instead of 5. I woke up the next morning, and the home theater no longer had sound. I deleted the group and set it up again, no luck. I noodled with the software for 2 hours, and it just refused to work. This seems to be a known issue. After getting the boxes together to return the devices, 6 hours later, the software magically fixes itself. Just to be certain, I spent some time trying to break it again to see where the instability is, but it's rock solid now. I'm thinking they pushed it into production without properly testing the software. Once it broke, they must have pushed a big update to fix it. It just took time for the updates to happen on all the devices. You hear that Amazon? You need to do a better job of testing your software!That being the case, it's the smartest home cinema you can buy. Most soundbar systems will make you use a separate remote to switch channels to Bluetooth, if you want Alexa to work...unless you want to pay for Alexa integration. The dual Echo configuration is completely seamless, because...well, it's an Echo. Music is what it does best. If you want music, Alexa plays music in full stereo. If you want to watch a movie, it automatically plays the sound in Dolby Digital using the Fire Stick. My Echo Sub arrived today, and I'm REALLY looking forward to trying that out.	4	October 3, 2022	Mike	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFXS2AOYHJAQYYIRM36AUQF6PAHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

638	Echo 4th Gen	Doesn‚Äôt listen well at all. Gen 1 was superior to gen 4.	I had a first generation Echo that I exchanged to get this new echo. To my disappointment this one doesn‚Äôt listen well AT ALL. The sound quality it top notch, but her voice recognition and listening is terribly sub par.I‚Äôve used it in 3 different spaces and that has made little difference. The only time she responds consistently is when I‚Äôm within 4 feet or really yell.In fact, my two echo dots ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE respond more consistently to me than this one does. I was literally 10 feet away from this echo and asked it to set a timer and both of my other echos (which have walls and hallways between me and them) responded to me and the one that had a clear line of sight and sound, didn‚Äôt even engage.If you‚Äôre looking for excellent sound, this will get the job done. If you‚Äôre looking for another child that doesn‚Äôt listen and often misunderstands what you said, this will also get the job done.I‚Äôd get the smaller echo dot clock before I‚Äôd get this, if my mom or grandma were to ask my opinion.	1	October 2, 2022	Jake Woodbrey	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHHAHXL7L745BL3JXFD3IJGPNB6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

657	Echo 4th Gen	Such an improvement in sound	"from the echo dot! Very happy with this unit. My main voice recognition complaint is she can't tell a squawking parrot from a dog, and when I am upstairs with the dog, resting silently, I'll get fone notices saying that the dog is barking, and would I like to drop in downstairs?  I've then asked her if she is guarding my house and she isn't. So no clue why I get constant notices! Now I won't believe her when she is guarding! I do like a new feature. With the loud parrots, I would call her name and she would flash her light, make an negative sound and stop responding. Yes, I have cussed at the AI when she didn't recognize my voice, and that is her default reaction to a cuss! But now, when I'm yelling across the room and the parrots then yell over me, instead if an AI version of a certain rude gesture, with light and sound and refusing to continue, she has learned manners. She politely says ""I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Could you repeat that?"". Much nicer. Again, the sound is way better than a single or pair of dots. More projection in  different directions. Works nicely with the music subscription. Like it so much, I'm considering rolling the dice on the $200 unit on Black Friday, to use in living room and putting this in my bedroom."	5	September 29, 2022	Busy Shopper	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AES4ZAQLHLFGFYFKLCLMD4FISTJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

It has to be in our bedroom to accomplish this, but we also like to use it in our Kitchen to control appliances and such there. Apparently, another Alexa device placed in the kitchen is needed and connected to the bedroom Alexa so normal level voice can control all from anywhere in the home.

Now i use it to control an echo link and when you pause and tell it to resume then it isn't even smart enough to go back to the same source that it was playing from prior to pausing.

However, the 4th generation microphones can't hear most of the time. I've tried multiple different locations to see if that would help and always get the same results. My 3rd generation Echo dots in other rooms respond before this one will. Once, the Echo finally responds after saying ""Alexa"" 2 or 3 times it then doesn't hear my request so then I have to start all over again. Alexa...silence.. Alexa again...still silent.. Alexa one more time...hey finally a response! Sound a bit to familiar? This must be the teenager version of the Echo...lol!

720	Echo 4th Gen	Great-ish	Update: the Echo is making the hell demon noises almost every other day now. Reaching out to customer service.I love this Echo. But this echo sounded like hell demons were in my kitchen at 2am last night. Woke us up from a sound sleep. The loudest, creepiest, hell demon-esq almost static sound went off every 30 seconds bringing me to think we were finally under attack by another planet, Terrified of what this noise could be. After getting the courage to hunt down this god forsaken sound in my house in the middle of the night, we head into the kitchen where Alexa makes one last demon noise before detecting our movement, gives a little flash of light and stops.After researching this I guess is a known problem and rare. I still love her, but she‚Äôs unplugged at night now!	5	September 22, 2022	MSBarrett	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHX5PUA2M46P6UQEDGJ4GWARACZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1
721	Echo 4th Gen	Wow I didn‚Äôt know it would be this much better	I have about 4 echo dots and I just really wanted to try the regular one. So for prime day i jumped on this and wow ü§© the difference between the echo dot and this Echo is astronomical.The Echo Dot surprised me with how much bass it has for the size of the speaker. This echo blows me away The bass sounds clear and surprisingly strong for such a little speaker. Honestly, I feel like it would put some of my bookshelf speakers to shame that cost just as much or more and require a separate amplifier for power.I really feel like the biggest drawback is the microphone‚Ä¶ No I‚Äôm not saying it is any worse than the echo dot but it certainly isn‚Äôt better. Sometimes I feel like you can‚Äôt hear me as I scream, Alexaaaaa! and other times it will randomly pop up as I‚Äôm whispering something similar.Overall, especially if you get it on a deal this is a fantastic Speaker. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in having higher Fidelity audio, but doesn‚Äôt want to jump for an audio file system. Bang for buck I don‚Äôt think that you can do much better than the echo. I‚Äôm very much considering getting a second possibly third or fourth.	5	September 21, 2022	Phonsina	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AENHPFHSZAYBL6SH6XTB4UGUSIKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

725	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa 4th gen Ball keeps loosing wireless connection, the Echo Dot doesn't.	I am OK with the appearance, though the round ball like profile is too overwhelming, I much prefer the Echo dot. My first complaint is that the newer ball shaped device take more space, LOTS more space. and my MAIN complaint is that Alexa 4gen keeps loosing wifi connections and I need to jump through hoops to get it to reconnect. Sounds like I am a winner, and I may be. Take into consideration that I have limited mobility and un plugging and re-plugging back in the modem, router and ECHO and then accessing the app in my phone to reconnect is just a pain in the ass.

749	Echo 4th Gen	4th Gen microphones are awful!  This device is practically deaf!	"I got this to replace my 2rd Gen Echo tower IN THE EXACT SAME LOCATION.  This new device is much worse for listening comprehension, and I must repeat everything loudly and slowly several times before she gets it.  The 'deafness' is extremely frustrating.  I wish that I had kept the 2rd Gen Echo which has the ""far-field voice recognition"" with the ""array of seven microphones tucked under the light ring"".  The 4th gen cuts microphones down to only four and moved their location.  It seems Amazon sacrificed hearing comprehension to give better sound quality.  I say they sacrificed too much.  Premium sound isn't any good if the device can't understand you.  I really hate this device."	2	September 18, 2022	Raymond L.	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUPZGVDJQDZ75Y7S7CU3AMOAHEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

798	Echo 4th Gen	I have Had 3 Replacement 4th Gen ECHOs !!	"I have a long story about my problems with Echo.  I had a 3rd Gen Echo which worked fine for my application in a Finished Basement used for music listening since 2021.  I had it connected / paired to 3 external BT devices : an IOTA Stereo preamp / amp stack; a Denon AV Receiver and a pair of JBL BT Speakers [Charge 3].  I would be able to select one of these devices to play Streamed music via the ECHO as the source and selector.  Suddenly on or about March 26, 2022 as I turned on the IOTA and asked Alexa to play Spotify, there was problem.  Same with the Denon and the JBL speakers.  As i checked the Alexa App to see if the devices remained paired on the list, they were listed but would not play.  I tried many measures (rebooting the Echo, Resetting the Echo , deleting and re-installing the Alexa App, Restarting my Verizon Router to no avail.  When I went to the App, looking to recognize and pair to the devices- the Echo would not recognize nor pair.  That required the first contact with Amazon Agents via Chatting.  The agent had me go through all the aforementioned steps again including Unplugging the Echo.  Nothing worked.  The agent said it must be the Echo unit itself.  Send it back to Them - it is out of Warranty due to its age, I was required to purchase a new 4th gen Echo (after many emails I was able to get a Discount of 25% on the purchase).  I received the 1st of the new 4th Gen Echos the following week.  I set it up as soon as I received it, and it did recognize and pair to my BT devices, play streamed music, but however, when I asked to play music without BT connections, the Echo would start up, then utter the words:  ""Sorry, That Device is Off Line"".  The frustration was increasing and the issue was perplexing.  Some light was shed when I went on Amazon's Community Forum under Devices in the Customer Service menu on their web site.  I posted my problem and received some many similar responses.  I use a Android based phone - Google Pixel 4XL - one poster's repsonse said that he had the same experience in the sudden mode - but not when using his wife's Apple iPhone !!  He suspected it was IT glitch in the Android / Amazon software.  After numerous phone call, Chats, and emails,  and more Posts to Amazon's Community Forum, finally a Supervisor (Mike , I think was his name),  contacted me and confirmed hat this issue was World Wide.  Then as suddenly as it stopped working, and without advance not from Amazon, sometime in May, the ECHO worked - it paired to the BT devices and played fime without problems that I cited!!  Then sometime therefater, the issue of Sorry, That Device is Off Line returned, but only when asking Alexa to play the Music from the Echo w/o BT connections.  More calls / chats and was asked to send that Echo back for a replacement. The replacement unit received in June (?), played fine when first connected and set up, but then after a few weeks, it happened again!!  That 2nd replacement unit was returned and the 3rd unit was received.  The same thing occurs despite the assurance form the agnt that this has the ""newest software and the problem is resolved"".  He was wrong !!  The 3rd replacement unit repeated the same issue.  I decided to send that 3rd unit back, got my full credit of $109 and ordered a new Echo Dot / with Clock.  That unit played fine until the other day - Same thing occured, when asking to play music from the Echo Dot (which recognizes and plays fine with any BT connection), it spews the same :  Sorry, That Device is Off Line"". I just learned that ECHOs are discretely Updated in the background by Amazon without Notice.  But only 3rd Gens and upward.  That's why my older 2nd Gen Echo located in another room in the house works fine without issues , although it has never been used to connect to any BT devices.  My wife uses it to listen to iHeart radio broadcasts an would be really Upset if I rocked that Boat.Bottom line : No. 1  The new Echo Dot with Clock will probably become a gift to my son for his new house.  This too is curious because he has 2 older Dots and uses the same smartphone I do (Google Pixel) in his apartment.  He does not have these issues. He does have his echo connected to a BT TV speaker system.  But his wife uses an Apple iPhone.  But his Dots are older units !!  This issue, particularly after Amazon admitted earlier that this was a World Wide issue and the fact that the units start off fine buy then suddenly changes, leads me to the one conclusion of a Software Glitch with Security Upgrades being done behind the scenes, affecting Android users.No.2 - after getting the Dot, the sound quality vs the 4th gen Echo is far inferior.No.3 - I am gifting the new Dot to my son, and ordering a Used 2nd gen Echo from Amazon to see if the problem evades the older Echo units.  Amazon only Updates 3rd gen and Up units.  If this Used 2nd gen does the same thing, it will go back and I will do without Echo in that finished basement.  I can use my Smartphone via BT to play music vai the BT devices.I have posted all of this on The Amazon Community Forum seeking any other advice or information to shed more light on this ongoing issue - at least for me.  PS:  i rebooted my Router numerous times, it is fully updated.  I could  not find any information that could lead to a Router issue that could be causing this."	4	September 13, 2022	Croatian 1951	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHXDD3VCQ6XK3HUXMSWQ4J2JWE4Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	False	1

818	Echo 4th Gen	Regression from the previous generations	(Update):  Amazon Customer support acknowledged the defect and sent a replacement as the product was under warranty. The new one is working fine so far (day 1) ----I have owned echo since the 1st gen released.  This one is a significant regression when it comes to voice recognition.  Really feel pathetic trading in my first gen for this. Kids stopped using Alexa as they get frustrated that the device doesn't recognize their instructions as well as it did before. Even the echo dot I have upstairs perform better than these.  Amazon does not do a great job of support for the devices.  They did remote diagnostics, sw upgrade etc remotely and eventually said I need to send this for repair which could take anywhere up to 3 months.

829	Echo 4th Gen	Microphones do not work, bottom light design is not an improvement.	I upgraded from a 2nd gen that I loved... Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me.  I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it.  The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible.  Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker.  I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me.  I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed.  Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me.  I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work.  There is definitely a flaw in the design or components.  Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues.  I am ready to throw this in the trash.***UPDATE: 10/5/22***Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me.  I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review.  They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones.  Why the reduction in microphones?  With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response,  and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond.  It is actually comical at this point.  I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond.  Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones.  I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing.  Huge disappointment for a great device.We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations.  By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time.  I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years.  2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio.  I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.	1	September 9, 2022	Danny	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFL7X5ISIQQVN4LH7VGN53T6CHMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

849	Echo 4th Gen	I love Alexa, but it's so dumb.	"I feel like I'm a fanboy of Alexa. I have Echo dot 4th gen, Echo 4th gen and Echo Plus and I love the capabilities of this smart device and the sound quality.Yesterday though, I tried pairing all of the devices so they will play together, and after trying so many different things, I got 2 devices to work, but the Echo dot just can't connect to the other 2. Not as ""Alexa play everywhere"", and not by adding it to the group in the app.Alexa also acts strangely when she doesn't understand something and just bleeps something and shuts off. If I ask a long question, she'll cut me and start operating based on half of my sentence.She never was able to answer something that is relevant to the previous thing we talked about. For example: ""Alexa, what is the tallest building"" and she would tell me ""Burj Khalifa"", I'd ask ""And what is its height"" and she wouldn't know what is ""it"", she doesn't know we just spoke about the Burj Khalifa.The thing is that its been so many years already and it seems like there is no progress in her abilities and sometimes it's seems like she gotten worse through the years.I used to be able to play ""My sleep playlist from spotify"" but now she will always look for playlists made by Spotify instead of playing the playlists I created. Even if I'll name the playlist ""sleep by me"" or some other more specific name of a playlist that isn't public on Spotify, she'll say ""Sorry , I don't know a playlist called ""Sleep by me"" even though that is exactly the name, and she's connected to my Spotify user."	1	September 6, 2022	HowToEvery	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFLYNN6QF6I36VZWDDAJUF24S7QQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

The Phillips hue bridge I have is broken so I ordered  this Echo (4th generation) based on the advertising that this Echo has a built in hub. I need to return this device and buy a new Phillips Hue bridge. This has been a very stressful experience and I have lost faith in Amazon as a truthful source.Wait a minute: I just received a call from JJ Amazon support. He helped me set up my lights. He deserves a raise in pay. He patiently talked me through a very complicated procedure. There was also an error in a help file which stopped any further progress in the procedure. The error was in a direction that  said to follow the directions here.  The word ""here"" was in regular typeface not in blue or italicized. When I finally decided to click on the regular looking word  ""here"" the instructions took me to the next page and I was able to complete the procedure.

I really admire the fact that all the devices that are made by amazon has a super good build quality.If I navigate to the Sound of this device: I think, the quality of sound is more than decent, enough to fill you with quality music if you are inside around a room. I also use my echo as a speaker for my desktop computer, thanks to its 3.5 mm jack support.Voice assistance Alexa works great: using Alexa app it is very straightforward to integrate different devices/home appliances with echo to control them using voice command. But sometimes when there‚Äôs music playing loudly or noise around the echo: it struggles to listen to my command.

1007	echo show 10	Good but can be better	The Echo show 10 fits the bill perfectly as a central hub for all your smart home as well as personal assistant needs. The built in Zigbee hub is great to seamlessly connect all your smart devices natively. Audio quality is pretty much just on par with the normal Echo devices and nowhere close to something like the Echo Studio.The biggest gripe about this device is that its s..l..o..w. Amazon packed in a lot of features into this device but forgot to use a decently performant microprocessor and RAM. Its slow for every damn thing you ask it to do. Touch response takes at least 4-5 seconds just to open apps. For a device thats not exactly cheap for what it does, this is a huge miss from Amazon's part. It doesnt take that much to use a faster CPU and memory which is cheap ! In general, its probably not such a big deal but it is the difference between a device that is good vs one that is extraordinary.	3	October 16, 2022	Sonal U.	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AG6XWWSQ4SWNY426F2YCP7ZBPSAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

1027	echo show 10	Love the motion tracking but the microphones are it's weakness	"I've owned this for 1.5 years now so am comfortable stating what I like and dislike.  I upgraded from an Echo  Show 2nd Gen and really liked that device.  The new tracking feature is what attracted me to upgrade.The tracking is very good.  I have this in the kitchen and get my morning news brief while making a cappuccino and my breakfast.  As I walk around the kitchen, it tracks me well so I can glance over at what is on the screen at a great viewing angle at all times.The downfall of this device is the microphones.  I [had] another echo device in the room next to the kitchen.  There is one wall and about 20 feet of distance separating them.  Many times while standing and looking at the echo for a command, the device in the next room would respond or start playing music.  So the microphone on the device 20 feet away is more sensitive than the device 5 feet away.  It became so frustrating that I unplugged the other device.Another issue with the microphone is with general commands.  If I'm playing music or news and give it the command ""Alexa stop"", it will sometimes pause briefly and then continue playing as if it doesn't care about what I'm asking.  I've tried ""Alexa, home screen"" and it will react the same way with a brief pause as it listens and then just continues on with what it was doing.  Repeating the command many times will eventually get it to stop.  There have been multiple times I just unplug it to get it to stop though.To me, this device was a step backwards in voice recognition and/or quality of the microphones.  I will have to think if I want to jump on being an early adopter in the future."	3	October 11, 2022	R.

1028	echo show 10	Does not perform as shown in stock photo	I purchased this as a home base for our family.  I wanted to be able to sync our calendars up to it and be able to have it on display for everyone to see.  I purchased the 10 gen 3 for the use of widgets like shown in the stock photo.  Unfortunately, widgets are not supported on the echo 10 despite it being shown in the photo.  I have to wait for the screen to filter through pictures, news, etc  before it shows the calendar that appears on the screen for 30 seconds before moving on.  I believe it is a misleading advertisement.	3	October 11, 2022	amy marenghi	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AERVMKTAIQ3JJQEZMBKLN3CIQJOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

I also love that I can connect this to my personal calendar. I am one of those people who live by my calendar so I love that it tells me what's happening day to day and coming up. I've also never really used routines until i got this device. They're pretty cool when you have a screen to leverage.The 1 major flaw, which many others have noted in their reviews, is the placement of the camera and how that affects the ""follow my face"" feature. Because the camera is located in the right upper corner it does not seem to ""follow"" very well and constantly bumps into things. I did try to adjust the ""follow"" range, and that did not work very well so I eventually just turned it off to avoid more frustration.

1086	echo show 10	A massive dissapointment	We bought this to replace an original Echo Show that died out. I thought getting this would be getting a top of the line option, but it's been anything but. Frequently, even though it's in the exact same spot as our old Show, this will not hear us. The times that it does hear us, it will misunderstand us WAY more often than any other Echo we have in the house. Also, since we end up shouting at it to hear us, I have noticed that very often the other Echos in our house will activate and start playing or set a timer in another room, which is something I don't remember ever happening with the previous Echo. I'm going to try and reset this thing to factory defaults again and see if that fixes anything, but to this point this thing has been a huge downgrade from the previous version.	1	September 28, 2022	Erich Gros	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFP3VTFWMBC7FZEPXIP57HCOB54Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0
1087	echo show 10	Awesome upgrade!	This show is awesome! We have so much fun with her as a family. She can take pictures you can use it as a camera when away from the house and the sound quality is great! My Grandchild can even call out songs she wants and Alexa gets it playing. Picture / screen quality is great as well. One app that I use often for recipes isn't very user friendly and it doesn't connect to my account but everything else is awesome.

1092	echo show 10	Irratic face following capabilities	"The novelty of Alexa Echo Show following your face or finding you in the room is interesting (at least once the initial absolute terror and creepiness wears off.) Nevertheless, practically, the face follow is a bit of a mess with video calling. My mother moves her body, in a kind of rocking manner when she speaks and she gesticulates with her hands frequently. Poor Echo Show trying to follow her makes you feel like you are in a new installment of Blair Witch Project. Zoom in, zoom out, move left move right, where are we? It is very distracting. I also find that the camera quality is terrible. Maybe because she's moving so much she never gets time to focus? So although the moving camera is novel, the execution leaves a lot lacking.Overall, Alexa seems to take triple the time to respond on the new Echo vs the Gen 2 Echo. Really? I don't know why. Same internet, same location. She's slow.... Basically she's quietly saying ""patience young padawan... You MUST learn patience""Also my mom SWEARS that the screen quality is less than her Gen 2 Echo. But she has dementia and failing eyesight so... I don't think I see any difference.Pros of the new echo:Built in privacy shieldCapability to join ZoomIt moves to find your face when you are anywhere in the room360 speakerEven more streaming integration optionsConsSlow to respond, Alexa forgets what she's doing a lot (maybe it's just her company?)Waves about wildly in video conference unless the speaker initiates ""statue mode"" while speakingSlightly unstable base (compared to the Gen 2)Would I buy it again? Part of me wishes I just got the giant TV Alexa but I don't think my mother would have been able to handle that much change at once. Overall, it's not annoying enough to return it or try to get my Gen 2 Echo back, but at the same time, there's lots of ""meh"" feelings going around.That's a wrap!"	3	September 27, 2022	Amazon4Life	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGUJJWVKVWC4WUROCZGH2DGT3PDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

1109	echo show 10	Very functional and useful Echo device	"I bought this Show device mainly for displaying photos. Having never used Amazon Photos previously, I was pleasantly surprised to see the near seamless integration between the service and my Echo Shows.

The rotating screen is adorable - we love seeing the current song playing, and the ability to remotely monitor the room is great as well. Sound quality is very good. Overall - very impressed with the device. There are some software issues occasionally, and the random occasional movie ""sponsored"" ads that turn up mysteriously are annoying. But if you spend enough time setting up the device and working through the issues, it's a fantastic device and a really useful addition to our family.

When I wake it up with ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù it will have the blue line moving awhile after I‚Äôve spoken my request like it‚Äôs taking time to register what I‚Äôm asking. When I have played sleep sounds and asked it to stop, it keeps playing it but it sounds like it‚Äôs coming from a distance. The motion catches shadows so it will turn toward the wall under my cabinet more times than not. When I video call my friend she says she can‚Äôt hear me and requests me to call her on video messenger. Great speaker but  overall not satisfied with this purchase especially for the price point and functionality.	2	September 18, 2022	Stephanie E.	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF6P2P4Y444D4FDYEWZSBKOUQCBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

1148	echo show 10	Subpar product	I bought this for my mom who has dementia as a way to 1) drop in, 2) play music, 3) setup routines, 4) display photos from two family members and 5) display the date/time/temp. Below are my opinions:1) The drop in calls freeze frequently.2) The music is a nice feature and I‚Äôm glad it is included with prime membership. If this is some sort of free trial I am going to guffaw about it later.3) The routines are okay, but don‚Äôt expect detailed routines out of the box. If you want Alexa to ask the user a question and answer based on response you have to start with blueprints which is a slightly more advanced feature.4) I am really disappointed with photo sharing! My sister and I linked our Amazon accounts for the soul purpose of sharing and displaying photos from both of our Amazon photo accounts. It isn‚Äôt working at all and only displaying photos from one device. When you send a photo to the echo it doesn‚Äôt save in a folder or anything, I have no idea where they‚Äôre going.5) 0/5 for the clock display settings. I cannot believe this device is incapable of adjusting the clock display. Im 33 years old and can‚Äôt see the date from 10-15 feet away. I thought this thing was designed for the size of a living room?Overall, I think the device is just okay. It is not designed to have multiple users outside of voice ID. Don‚Äôt expect using the app on multiple phones to be easy. This isn‚Äôt great for elderly or cognitively impaired people if they don‚Äôt understand how to speak to AI well. Honestly, the only reason I feel like this device is so expensive is because of the motion control. We had to turn the motion control off because it constantly rotated around the room. It was comical. Also, the black device comes with a white cord.

1158	echo show 10	Good Product Overall	"I use this on a daily basis to set alarms, play music, listen to podcasts, and do weekly reminders. It works incredibly well and its nice to have a good interface to look at while you're setting anything up. The only bummer about it is sometimes it has a hard time tracking your face and will flip around completely away from you even though you're standing right in front of it. Would love a better version, but this works great as is if you're keeping it stationary and pointed at you in a kitchen or office.Things to keep in mind if you're buying this:‚Ä¢ If you've seen videos of people putting their own sound to routines, nix it now. They got rid of the feature that allowed you to use your own sounds and now apparently its a painful process to do.‚Ä¢ Its not the be all, end all. You still have to set up routines using the alexa app on a phone and go through all the hardship of learning what its actually capable of doing.‚Ä¢ If you're setting up voice operated routines, they have to be EXACT. So if you set up the routine to activate when you say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"" it won't understand what you want unless you specifically say ""Cheeseburgers and Fries"". No variation will be accepted for the routine.‚Ä¢ This thing gets what I'm saying to it wrong all the time and I don't even have an accent. I'm from Illinois originally and I annunciate fairly well on what I'm saying about 99% of the time and it still has issues picking up what I'm saying correctly.‚Ä¢It DOES allow for camera monitoring on multiple systems. I have a blink camera setup around my house / garage / etc.. that I can ask it to display camera 1 etc... to see views on the fly. Works extremely well. Would highly recommend setting it up.‚Ä¢ Splurge and get the monthly amazon music. I can spout off anything, including comedy specials and listen to them whenever I want through voice commands. Extremely nice to have even if it costs a bit."	4	September 14, 2022	Miles Vincent Bridges	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AH7XA5S7U7NN5Z2VVI44VGRMCO3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

1166	echo show 10	It sucks	I love Amazon products, I've always wanted an Echo show especially this one because of the camera. The quality however, is absolutely terrible. I regret this purchase so much. I had a Google Home previously, but it could not connect to my Ring camera so i ordered this device. Ring connects, but everything else just sucks. No Live Tv unless you have Hulu Live, we have YoutubeTV and that connects on Google Home, delay in the camera, LOTS of lagging, you HAVE to be specific when you want her to play something. Do you have a Prime Video subscription? Get ready to say specific season and episode number to her, otherwise she plays something completely random or doesn't play anything at all. I miss my Google Home product, sure it doesn't connect to ring, but the quality is SO much better and this is coming from someone who has an Alexa product in every single room. My Google Home was a gift and that was the only reason i had it. If i could return this i would, but my return period has ended. I was trying to give it the benefit of the doubt and attempt to enjoy it, but man i just have a $200 regret sitting on my counter. I hate this device so so much.	2	September 13, 2022	Emm	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AE7MGXFJCCAF7LPFFPRDFAP3C2LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

But when I turned it on it worked well enough except I had to yell at it to get it to respond after the initial prompt. E.g., I would try to tell it to stop playing music (music was not loud) and it wouldn't. NOT EVEN A DAY OF HAVING IT,  it stops being able to move. It kept saying ""movement temporarily unavailable"" and I did everything to troubleshoot. After getting a replacement, I realized they had sent me a refurbished one. Because the packaging was different. This one had the user manual and warranty booklets and the power cord is supposed to come in a separate cardboard holder in the top brace.

1177	echo show 10	A disappointing product, particularly if you want to use it with your Ring alarm	In my original review (see below) I complained that we couldn't get this Echo Show to work with our Ring cameras.Amazon responded to my review and said that function exists and works just fine.  Our experience was that we could not get all of the cameras to just passively be on the screen.  Maybe there is a difference for different types of cameras?  We have 3 different types of Ring cameras - the doorbell cam, an indoor cam, and 2 outdoor wired floodlight cams.  I tried for a couple hours, then my girlfriend tried for a couple hours.  We couldn't get it to do what we wanted.So I'll change my review to say that while Amazon claims this functionality exists we were unable to make it do this despite hours of trying.===============My original review:We purchased this to use with our Ring alarm system, so that we could have a monitor on the kitchen counter to see the Ring cameras.  We figured since Echo and Ring are both part of the Amazon family that they would have really nice integration.Oh so wrong we were!You can get a full-featured app for the ring alarm on an android or an apple tablet.  Weirdly there is no skill for this on Echo, and super weirdly there isn't even one on Fire Tablets.  (You have to use a backdoor to install the android app store and then you can download it).  It does do some basic things with Ring doorbell, but that's it.I had expected to be able to do other things - video conferencing (nope, not with any normal service like Zoom or Google Meet) or watch directTV (nope).I found this product only marginally more useful than an echo speaker.  While its cool that it rotates to follow you around, I was left with the question - what is this for?  It wasn't worth the money and it wasn't worth the countertop space.	1	September 10, 2022	Joe A	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFOGWR63C5M7XWWK2XQVCTCBRMJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

1185	echo show 10	Slow user interface	Looks very cool and sounds great. Really like the integration with smart home devices. However the user interface is very slow and lagging.

I've completely disabled the motion because not only are the warning banners annoying, but most of the time I'm in one place and the screen thinks I'm somewhere completely different.  The voice recognition on this device is abismal.  I'd much rather use my Echo Show 8 or my dot before I use this one.

1197	echo show 10	We LOVE the screen and the sound quality is amazing!!!	We had a first gen Echo Show 6 which was purchased used to try out and see if we liked it.  Well, we loved it!  As it aged however it started acting up.  Because of the prominent placement of the device and its near constant use I thought it would be best to graduate to the Echo Show 10.  What a great move!  The screen is movable (tilting up and down) and if you leave the camera lens cover open, the screen will follow you around the room so you can always see the screen.  We chose to close the cover because that freaked us out a little.  Just the same, this thing is amazing!  The sound quality is right up there with Bose!

1199	echo show 10	Don‚Äôt waste your money	Compared to the first gen show, this thing is a set back. It‚Äôs kinda neat that it will follow you around but the practicality for that just isn‚Äôt there. This show is so slow‚Ä¶soooo slow, It‚Äôs almost like they put a PlayStation 1 processor in it. And for some stupid reason it almost never hears us. And usually misses the wake word. Compared to the echo dots this thing sucks at hearing you. We usually end up shouting at it. There is a 95% chance I‚Äôm gonna use it with some tannerite for target practice. Might switch to google and see how those devices do.	1	September 6, 2022	Amanda	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHC2ACWMGNKM37MY3IYIOVPJHIRA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

1221	echo show 10	I really wish I could give 5 stars	The product is amazing. If you‚Äôre into tech or just need an extra screen by the kitchen counter it does the job but the Alexa integration is so SLOW for a product at this price tag.

Showing the Ring camera and controlling your smart home is just way too slow to be useful, most of the times I just open the app on my phone to make it quicker. Bummer that you can‚Äôt select the color of RGB smart lights! A lot of room for SOFTWARE improvement.

I am not sure if this was a refurbished product but it did not meet my expectations. The device felt extra slow for a 3rd generation product; The touch screen is not always responsive. The settings menu freezes a lot; Sometimes it crashes and goes to idle or Screen Saver mode while I'm in the middle of interacting with the menu. It is not consistent with announcements, especially when someone is at my front door; Also the Camera does not always show an image of the front door. The front camera does not always recognize me (male) from everyone else in my house (all Women). I thought a New software update may be able to help but it was worst.

1252	echo show 10	Very poor design and usability.	"Pretty much a useless overpriced piece of junk. What's the point of installing a tablet on an echo device if it doesn't do anything a touchscreen device from even 15 years ago could. Pretty lame. It has almost zero app support or usability. Even if you manage to get it to go to Amazon Prime or Netflix you can't properly navigate through it.How are they going to pretend you can use Netflix, Amazon Prime or other streaming services simply by talking to it but not being able to actually visually navigate through it in a reasonable manner?I use YouTube music, the only way to use it on the echo Show is to use it through the internet and it is so slow, laggy and glitchy it's not even worth using, it truly is that bad. Even if you use Amazon music you can't click on an album and see all the tracks it's virtually useless how am I going to look through my music by talking to it? There's no reason it can't allow you to navigate through your music by using the touch screen, it's absolutely terrible.This would be the equivalent of only being able to speak to your tablet then your tablet giving you very limited information based on what you asked, the whole point of the echo show is that you're supposed to also have touch screen and interface usability beyond just speaking to it.In Amazon's defense the only thing I can say is they did call it the Echo Show.There's no excuse it can't support any app or function as a tablet except they have gone completely out of their engineering it not to. You installed a tablet on the device, it should work as one but it doesn't so I see no point in its existence. I don't need a display to kind of show me what I asked with the least information given.Even the most mundane of tasks asking it the weather the best you get is the temperature as it shows the temperature on screen with zero other information or even something to click on to give you more, nothing. What do I need that for??I could look at my thermometer outside my window for that. What an absolute joke.It's just a $250 display that sits on my counter now. Great, thanks Amazon for manufacturing a useless device!!Another huge thing is for the amount of space there is for a speaker in the device it has subpar sound at best.I have speakers half the size of this that sound better with fuller sound and dynamic range.Seriously, this device was excessively ""dumbed down"".I wish I could send it back still and get my money back.Don't waste yours."	1	August 25, 2022	Ryan	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGCHYMOWG7GKJI3XLDNJI4RIFNUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

1264	echo show 10	Objectively worse at picking up commands compared to 2nd gen Echo Show 10	"The 3rd generation Echo Show 10 is worse at picking up voice commands, has worse audio, but the screen can be completely vertical which helps for video calling. Overall, I'm not happy upgrading from the 2nd gen to the 3rd gen.This version of the echo show 10 is objectively worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10 at picking up voice commands. This manifests itself in either doing nothing, hanging (taking 15 seconds or so for the blue ""listening"" stripe to disappear, where you can't interrupt it), or asking to repeat your command. It was so bad, I finally decided to return it, but realized I'm outside of the return window. Hence, this review instead.The sounds quality is also worse than the 2nd generation Echo Show 10. Specifically, voices in audio are just harder to hear from a few yards away compared to the 2nd generation. It feels like the audible spectrum gets distorted quite easily, even at lower volumes. Turning the volume up just gets cluttered and noisy.I bought this device for the sake of making video calling easier. The fact that the screen can be tilted and get completely vertical is great, as the last generation pointed upwards about about 10 degrees. When making calls with our kid, we'd have to prop up the back end of the 2nd gen Echo Show, and this devices solves that problem. It does this very well.I was going to gift my 2nd generation Echo Show 10 to someone, but I think I'm switching back to that and giving this one away. I'm pretty disappointed with this Echo."	2	August 22, 2022	Dennis F. Cwik	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGHQ3SBVXTIVCY4U2SGMQQY7IODQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	0

1276	echo show 10	Worthwhile upgrade from original Echo Show	I upgraded my original version of the Echo Show with this model.  I find the camera, the screen and the sound to be great and definitely worth the upgrade.  And the ability the tilt the screen up and down is a big plus.  We have this in the kitchen/family room area which is open and the sound travels nicely around the space.  The people we have called on the device have all said how much better the camera is on their end.  The only thing that is still to be determined is the follow motion (circular path of the screen).  It took us a few uses to figure out that a ceiling fan and TV image was causing the focus to try to adapt and created some left and right rotation when we hadn't moved.  Once we isolated that, the feature is interesting, but we have not really found a need for it and have since disabled it.  I would not pay extra for the rotating screen feature, but the rest of the updated features are outstanding.	4	August 21, 2022	TravelVanter	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AETC7MMIHOQ3SEGSJAUK3KYETRAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	False	1

For instance if you're watching Netflix and you ask it to turn off the lights it stops Netflix and you have to restart up Netflix to continue your movie.  Also if you have reminders set it overrides what you're currently doing such as watching a movie Etc.

Works well and when the Ring has motion or person it will let me know. Can also view it from there. I do have a smart TV with Alexa which I can view Ring from the TV, so the office was the best choice. I do have to reset from time to time, not a big deal it comes back and works perfectly.

1296	echo show 10	Disappointed...	I had really high hopes for this Echo Show.  I traded in my Echo 8 that I really liked because I wanted more robust sound and features while I'm in the living room/kitchen area.  While I agree that the sound is better, I'm pretty disappointed in how slow the response and functionality is compared to my Show 8.  I'll call out for Alexa in the room and the other units in other rooms detect my voice and the Show 10 will respond a few seconds later or sometimes no response at all. I don't like the motion following me so that's disabled so it's mostly for the audio at this point, especially since there's no Youtube video integration with Alexa devices.  I still use it, but for the price I paid and getting rid of the Echo 8 has made me lose favor with the Show 10.	3	August 20, 2022	B.

I was expecting a SMART interface where I could pin apps, sticky notes, reminders, holiday countdowns, etc.. but NO! This alexa does not have that capability, it is not customizable .

You can only view the Live View over a wifi network. It doesn't have to be the same one. This is a inconvenience for me. And something worth noting prior to purchase.I can settle for it, as I am finding it useful for organizing my day, video chatting with family, dropping in, making announcements etc.Other than that tid bit, all works as advertised or described.Sometimes a factory reset (first option) does the trick in resolving any technical errors you may come across.	4	August 11, 2022	MJ	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGYJ6PVW4S6PRSA6WNAXHJMIMOCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1
1373	echo show 10	Great for what it is, but it has issues.	"I have various issues with this device.First is the way it reacts to ""show me how"" commands. Sometimes it will pull up a video on YouTube, and other times it will just pull up web options for you to tap on, which doesn't help when you have your hands in food.Second is the face tracking on this device. It always overshoots to the left because the camera is in the top right corner, and if you move your face in front of the screen, it will turn away from you. It also will occasionally lock onto something else when it overcompensates like a paper towel roll causing it to basically face the wall.Last complaint is the unnecessarily tedious process to use your own recipes in alexa. You have to manually go through and add them to the recipe database for Alexas ""all recipes"" app, and I haven't found a way to just import an existing recipe from other sites."	4	August 11, 2022	Ryutsuki	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFWU7VIF7MUDAK5EQNBRQQY5MQ2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

1385	echo show 10	Clumsy with Low Light and TV on	My current echo show device is placed on a corner table between the sofa and recliner. I really liked the idea of display facing the person asking the question. However it fails to rotate unless you keep room lights on 24/7 (Low light warning). Doesn't rotate if the camera privacy window is closed. Gets confused about who asked the question if TV is on. Also places requested items in a small window example show Ring Front door bell and then asking to show a different device. So you have to reach over and close or maximize window.

1423	echo show 10	Not ready for prime time	This device is a good idea however it doesn‚Äôt work most times when using the ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù feature.  I have it at my Mom‚Äôs house to check in on her from a distance.  I use the drop-in feature because at this point the device is too complicated for her to use.  The problem with the feature is that when I end the connection on the Alexa app to the echo 10 the echo 10 does not hang up.  This prevents a new connection next time I try to drop-in.  The only solution is to get in my car and drive there to press the screen‚Äôs red ‚Äúend icon‚Äù.  Once that is done I can then initiate a new ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù call.  This seems to be an easy fix for the programmers at Amazon.  Just have the echo 10 timeout the ‚Äúdrop in‚Äù call if there are no activities from the caller.  Yes, I chatted with their tech support.  About 12 of them.  Annoying as hell.  You just get passed on from one tech person to another tech etc.  with no one knowing what to do. I felt I knew more about the echo 10 then amazon‚Äôs tech support.  All 12 of them. It‚Äôs a shame.  And being an engineer I certainly know more about solving problems than all of them.  I am going to keep the device because it does save me one daily trip.  Drop in, works at lease once a day after my drive there to touch the ‚Äúend‚Äù call icon.  However the product truly is not ready for prime time.  If 12 Amazon techs and me (engineer), and many hours chatting with them cannot resolve the problem. The echo 10 needs much more bug fixes.	3	August 7, 2022	A B.	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFMKWPLMLQGFP5UL2ZNDIQPMSP5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

If you‚Äôre looking to automate your home and/or have a multi room sound system, I HIGHLY recommend that you DONT choose alexa.Unfortunately, this has been a rare product that gets worse with time - strictly talking software and functionality not hardware.Owning echos for about 3 years now, the first year was great and since then the software, app, connectivity between Alexa‚Äôs and functionalities have g√©stela deteriorated.I‚Äôve tried everything to reset, update, to no avail. Software is just not Amazons strong suit and it clearly shows. I‚Äôve spent hours with customer service agents trying to help and it boils down to they don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúfix it‚Äù or will pass it on to developers. Aka, yeah sucks it happened but thanks for buying though! Now, I will say they‚Äôve been kind and tried to help but it‚Äôs just a poor quality product.From constant music issues, to alexa devices turning on and off on its own, regression in functionalities, I regret having dove in deep to the alexa ecosystem.For my offices I‚Äôve since switched to other home devices as tests and so far so good.

However, it could be a bit more sensitive or precise.  We have a larger kitchen and it is relatively easy to step outside the tracking range.  When this happens the screen can stall at a position that is less than optimal.

Don't blame it on poor wiring.  It's technology with too many bugs to bother with.  Be glad when I move out... and use real light switches again.	1	August 4, 2022	nettiegurl16	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHT2FXCCVPDKKIMQ6S7AVHQ4ZNSA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	False	0

1465	echo show 10	Overlooked Camera Design	Camera is off-center so the camera follow, which is a main feature, is always not actually facing you since the software also does not compensate for the offset camera. This could totally be fixed through an update, but they have yet to act on this. Echo devices occasionally activate in other rooms and then the echo device in the room I‚Äôm in ignores me. It would be great if you could adjust sensitivity of certain devices like you can with Google Nest speakers. Wish there was an actual AppStore for the echo devices with a display so you can use any recipe app, but you are limited to the very few available that have specific Echo skills available for them. Overall an OK device. The speaker sounds great, but lacking in other areas like screen follow and app options.	3	August 3, 2022	Brendan Riddle	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AER3236Q2IGJZOX5QEMAQSBJ7DJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1
1466	echo show 10	Do NOT waste the money.	Paid up for this version hoping it would listen to me call her name compared to my Show 8 2nd. She doesn‚Äôt listen to anything. She‚Äôs 3 ft away from me. I have to yell for it to do things. Speakers are decent. I‚Äôd say not even close to worth full price. Also when you have an alarm set, in between or leading up the screen lights up the whole room 15 minutes before the alarm. Absolutely the most annoying feature. Doesn‚Äôt understand adaptive brightness either. She also doesn‚Äôt seem to comprehend what music you want to listen to, instead she pulls one word from what you said and plays whatever song exists with that phrase. 2/10 on this one. Fix the software.	3	August 3, 2022	Andrew Co	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEQ6FYMXWIT6ENK2SQQ2S5UL6UVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1

1468	echo show 10	Echo Show is a good upgrade	Replaced our old Echo with this one and so far it has been working well. I appreciate that it has the screen, which makes it more useful in the kitchen. But having the camera open with the screen turning to face you isn‚Äôt that helpful, and I miss the blue ring lighting up as an acknowledgment of hearing your voice (it lights up along the bottom of the screen, which can be hard to see). Overall this is a good upgrade from our old Echo and I do recommend it.	5	August 3, 2022	Mikko	https://amazon.com//gp/profile/amzn1.account.AF3ZX4W2HBDUUAPDYQMVAAEVC33Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8	True	1
1469	echo show 10	She‚Äôs smart	I love that she follows me around and when I‚Äôm at work I can put on camera and see that my husband is safe.
