0	Echo 4th Gen	QUICK SUMMARY:---------------------------The 4th generation Amazon Echo brings welcome upgrades from previous generations. The device features a Zigbee smart hub, improved sound reproduction, and a temperature sensor. Alexa integration works as expected. I would recommend the 4th gen Echo to those who are in the market for their first Alexa device and who listen to music often at a casual level. I would not recommend this as an upgrade for those with previous generation Echo devices if they are functioning normally, or for those expecting a high-end audiophile experience.PREFACE:---------------------------I have owned the 4th generation Amazon Echo for 9 months and use it daily. I upgraded from a 1st generation Amazon Echo. As part of a Prime Echo trade-in promotion, I was able to purchase this for $25 off the $99 MSRP.Tasks I utilize Echo for:---------------------------• (Daily) - Adjusting power/brightness/color of 2 connected LIFX smart bulbs• (Daily) - Retrieving daily weather forecast information• (Daily) - Retrieving temperature of the room the Echo is in (room is hotter than the rest of the house)• (Weekly/Monthly) - Engaging with various media/games (Pandora, Amazon Music, Question of the Day, Jeopardy, etc.)• (Weekly/Monthly) - General search query for basic information/knowledgeEnvironment:---------------------------The Echo is 3 feet away from where I sit. It’s placed on a table in the corner of a 10x10 room, about 2 inches in front of a (silent) PC tower. It's on a flat, level surface, and is within line-of-sight with no obstacles or materials between myself and it that would hamper its ability to hear me. On the opposite side of the room is a small air purifier at floor level that is always on and set to its lowest setting (40 dB of white noise).PROS:---------------------------• Sound Reproduction: The upward-firing 3” woofer and two, forward-firing 0.8” tweeters push out more sound than expected for a device of this size and price. Bass is surprisingly powerful, covers a lower frequency range than expected (it won't rattle the room like a dedicated subwoofer, however), and is capable of filling small rooms with ease. Treble is clear and crisp without distortion. Mids are pronounced and dynamic, but can be overpowered if bass and treble are simultaneously working hard. Dialogue from movies, videos, and podcasts is clear and feels well-balanced. Casual audio tinkerers will be pleased with additional EQ settings in the Amazon Alexa smartphone app, although audio sounds excellent as-is and adjustments are likely not necessary unless specific listening needs require adjustments.• Temperature Sensor: This is an odd bonus to me, but a welcome one that I use often. It is self-calibrating, and routines can make use of its readings.• Line In/Out Audio Jack: There is a 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the device next to the power adapter port which can be toggled to send audio out to another device if you wish to use the Echo with external speakers, or to accept audio if you wish play audio from another device using the Echo’s speakers.• Build Quality: It feels sturdy and has heft but isn’t burdensome. The fabric mesh that covers the top-half of the sphere is a nice color, the buttons are pleasantly tactile but quiet, and the circular grip on the bottom ensure it won’t slide around while playing music or if gently bumped.NEUTRALS:---------------------------• Response Time: Marketing for this Echo focused heavily on the all-new AZ1 Neural Edge processor at the time of purchase, bragging of faster, smoother, and more natural Alexa voice interaction performance and processing times. The marketing was heavy, and over-emphasized what is an unnoticeable difference; there is, at best, perhaps fractions of a second saved compared to the 1st gen Echo, but it’s case-by-case. In most cases, the processing time is the same.• Alexa Features/Performance: Largely unchanged compared to previous generations due to Alexa being a multi-device AI ecosystem rather than a single, device-specific feature. It does what you expect of Alexa.CONS:---------------------------• Voice Recognition: Bad. The environment outlined above is how I’ve used this Echo since I purchased it. The previous, 1st generation Echo had no issue with white noise, background noise, etc. This 4th generation Echo struggles to pick up my voice if there is any level of white noise, or if I’m speaking to it from more than a few feet away. 90 – 95% of voice interactions require that I repeat myself with increasing volume (sometimes two, three, four or more times) for it to register what I’m saying correctly, if I’m heard at all. Voice commands are constantly misinterpreted (verified by reviewing the history in the app), and wake words are often missed. Voice recognition performance is so poor, I have considered replacing this device altogether with one from a different ecosystem. I shouldn’t need to be just beneath shouting volume to be heard, and I shouldn’t feel constantly inconvenienced by using voice commands versus smartphone apps to control smart home features.• Temperature Sensor Rate of Refresh: I have found no documentation or answers about how often the temperature sensor is refreshed. However, it often seems like the readings are delayed and take a long time to change, even when there is a noticeable increase/decrease in air temperature as a result of thermostat changes.	3	October 3, 2021	1
1	Echo 4th Gen	I will start off on a good note:  The sound is so much better than the previous generations.  However....As you can see there are two devices in the photo.  The one on the right is the original purchased, the one of the left was the used one I was sent to replace the one I am having problems with.  Clearly the replacement one was used, it has a small faded stain on it.  The issues I am experiencing involves the voice recognition.  I can say its name and it does not respond, sometimes I will have to raised my voice to a yell for it to hear me which does not work well when others are sleeping.  Other times, my older generation device in my bedroom responds and there is a wall between me and it.  I am sitting aprx 8-10 ft away from the device and it does not hear!  Sometimes when I ask it for my notifications, the one in the bedroom answers me thru the wall which of course I can't hear the notification!  They are going to send me a third one, due to the fact the replacement one I received was used.  Hopefully, the third time is the charm!  Aside from the issues with this particular device, I have always loved my Echo Dots.	3	October 17, 2022	1
2	Echo 4th Gen	I was super excited to get these, I’ve had an Alexa in every room for years and free entry upgrade. The idea of cute spheres I could mount on my walls was super appealing, so I got the maximum quantity and mounted them using a cute white stand.That’s about where my excitement around these new speakers ended. Every Alexa model has a few quirks here and there, but these things specifically are actual trash. The number of artifacts during playback is insane, frequent, and every one of them is obnoxious. They wake me up in the middle of the night frequently with their BS, I’m about to rip them off the walls and through them out the window.Examples:-This morning I got woken up super early by a crackle that can only be called “fireworks” playing on top of sleep sounds out 2 of my speakers.-every single time I’m playing music or sleep sounds and ask Alexa to lower or raise the volume she’ll do it at first and then goes into stutter mode rapidly turning the audio on and off in all speakers, or fading the sound in and out rapidly. Every time I use my voice to change the volume I have to stop and restart my music.-Sometimes Alexa decides to just not change the volume on voice command at all, regardless of which phrase you use to ask her to. Sometimes you ask her to do “volume 3” and she’ll play 3 everywhere except one room where she plays volume 10 and you jump up screaming “Alexa Stop” before your eardrums burst but she apparently can’t hear you over the noise she’s making and so you have to run to another room and scream at a different Alexa to get her to stop and then manually adjust the volume for that one speaker in the app-often not all speakers in a group or room will play together even if they show as grouped in the app and you select that specific group for playback. There are two ways to fix this, remove and re-add the offending speaker, or send music to that speaker solo for a minute and then try the group again.-Randomly the speakers produce really loud constant static. So you’ll have multiple speakers playing music in a group and suddenly one will go static and the only way I’ve found to get it working again is to unplug it, wait a few minutes, and plug it back in.-in general the speakers are not consistent in sound quality, the music sounds slightly more tinny in one, more rich in another, more base heavy in another…it’s slightly noticeable with music if you switch the one that’s playing back and forth to hear the sound quality differences… but where it’s really obvious is with sleep sounds, frogs will sound higher in one, deeper in another, and like possessed demon frogs in a third.  One of the speakers plays sleep sounds at double speed and I’ve not found a way to fix it. For that one music is sometimes normal and sometimes double speed.-occasionally an actual demon from hell talks over my speakers and during the Covid lockdown I for sure thought I was going crazy. Occasionally a male or female voice will just talk through my speakers briefly, one or two words, and then nothing for a few weeks till suddenly in the middle of the night someone talks out my speakers again. I got paranoid and put them on their own dedicated WiFi channel and super protected it with a random 32-character password, I monitor my network traffic and access, and even still sometimes these things will pick up or play a person talking randomly.Since I bought these speakers there has not been a single day where I haven’t had to try various workarounds to get them to function. I’ve become a regular on troubleshooting forums and invested so much of my time trying to solve various random problems…it’s gotten to the point where I avoid using them if at all possible because they just don’t work correctly. I’ve grown to actually hate them due to my experiences and while I was a die hard Alexa fan prior to these, I will probably never buy another Alexa product again. I’m going to try to ride them out as long as possible to get some semblance of my money’s worth, but very soon these are all going in the trash…maybe the next time it wakes me up at 4am with sudden loud audio artifacts…	1	August 23, 2022	0
3	Echo 4th Gen	"[Edit] This is my second time to edit this review. I've now dropped my review from the original 4 stars down to 1 star. I'm at the point of regretting making the purchase of two of these.This was my first experience owning an Amazon Echo. Maybe if I had experienced one of the earlier models that actually worked, I would have a better impression, but this model really is a piece of crap. The micrphone hardly ever works right. When it does actually hear you speaking to it, it often misunderstands what you're saying. Most of the time, we have trouble getting it to work because it won't even stay connected to the wifi.Out of frustration, I decided to run a test. I purchased some of the Google Nest devices and hooked those up in the same rooms as the Amazon Echo devices. When the Echo devices misunderstand what we're saying, we try with the Google Nest devices and they work flawlessly.For the last two days, every single time we talk to Alexa, her response is that she can't understand because she isn't connected to the internet. Every time we get that response from Alexa, we turn to the Google Nest and it works perfectly. Every single time the Amazon Echo fails us, the Google Nest steps up to the plate and performs exactly how you want it to.I really have deep regrets about purchasing these Amazon Echo devices. I've seen other reviews that say how much better the older models of the Echo are and how much better they perform. It's a shame we had the bad luck of trying the Echo for the first time on a model that is truly a lemon, because it burned us out on the whole Echo product line and sent us running for the competition.If we continue to have the problems with our Echo devices, I'll probably just go ahead and disconnect them and see if I can get some of my money back by selling them on Ebay or something. I wish I had just purchased the Google Nest originally and never had to deal with all of the issues with this Echo. Also, the Google Nest costs much less than this garbage. How does that happen. It costs like 1/3 the price and works flawlessly? Why can't Amazon make their product as well as Google makes theirs? I don't know. Just super unhappy with these Echo devices right now.[End Edit][Original Review]I wanted to get some Echo devices for my kids for Christmas. Target had the best price with a pre-black friday sale on the 4th gen Echo with premium sound, but that's because they were actually shipping the lower cost Echo while charging for the Echo with premium sound. After straightening that whole mess out and deciding that I couldn't trust Target to not try to cheat me, I purchased the 4th gen Echo devices straight from Amazon.The sound is pretty good, but I have a lot of hearing loss, so I'm not actually a very good judge on that. But to a guy who is half deaf, they sound ok.My biggest problem is that I have to say something to Alexa usually 2-3 times before she responds. When I say ""Alexa..."" the light ring at the base lights up, so I know the Echo is awake and listening, but simple commands like ""Alexa, turn on the lamp"" are met with stone cold silence and have to be repeated a couple of times before Alexa acts or responds. I guess the technology for this just isn't where I thought it was when we purchased these.At least once a day, both of my Echo devices tell me they can't turn a light on/off because they can't find the device, which starts a lengthy process of my trying to get the Echo to re-recognize the smart home plug that we previously had configured. Why does the Echo randomly forget the smart home devices that have been installed? I'm still trying to figure that out.The Echo devices also randomly lose the wifi signal in our house frequently. In the first two weeks, I can count at least 7 times one or the other of our Echo devices could not connect to our wifi, while multiple computers, tablets, phones, and smart tvs were all connected to the wifi with ease, the Echoes were seeming to struggle to maintain a connection to the wifi.We were having fun with the ""kitty kitty"" skill you can download to have alexa play a sound of a kitten calling it's mommy. Our cats went crazy trying to find the kitten. But of course, nothing is free in life, especially not when Jeff Bezos feels he can squeeze another penny into his pocket, so Alexa wants to run down a lengthy list of other sound options for the ""kitty kitty"" that can be purchased. If you don't want to listen to this long listen of purchase options, you can say ""Alexa stop"" or ""Alexa no thank you"", but either way, if you don't buy one of the add ons, Alexa gets a serious attitude in the tone of her voice to let you know she disapproves of your decision to not throw your money at Jeff Bezos.It's not just with the ""kitty kitty"" skill thing either. There have been several occasions when Alexa had such a tone in her voice that it made me stop and turn to look at the Echo. I would not be surprised if the blue light ring at the base was pulsating in a blood red color.Just based on all the hype about these, I seriously expected better performance from them, so I was really disappointed. With the problems we have using these 4th gen echo devices, I can't even imagine how much it was a problem with the 1st gen devices. Knowing what I know now, I would probably not buy these again or recommend them to anyone else. I think that maybe future versions will work a little better and not require you to repeat commands to Alexa so often. But if Alexa doesn't lose her attitude, I expect that by the time 8th gen devices roll out, Alexa will have the ability to hover in the air while spitting pea soup all over everything in the room and speak with a demonic voice as she stops asking you to buy add-ons and demand that you give all of your bank account and credit card info directly to Jeff Bezos."	1	January 14, 2021	0
4	Echo 4th Gen	"Update October 11—-DO NOT BUY. AMOAZON WILL FORCE UOU TO PREPAY/BUY REPLACEMENT WITH PROMISE TO REFUNF FULLY —THEN KEEP/STEAL UOUR KONEY (about $200), THEN BATTER AND BURY YOU WITH ABUSIVELY PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE OVERSEAS FAKE CS WHOSE ONLY GOAL, IN MY EXPERIENCE, IS TO GRIND YOU AND LIE TO YOU.Update Aug 29 #2-----Now I receive two emails (and NOT the requested escalation for corporate repeatedly requested) from Amazon filled with flat out lies about refunded money not delivered and misleading summary of sneaky offer of ""courtesy"" offered in ""empathy"" but then ""summarized"" -- in complete contradiction to the courtesy characterization furnished and my explicit rejection of the offer if in any way related to a resolution--- in as being a ""part of a resolution.""Update Aug 29--131 minutes (2hours 11 min) on call with Amazon CS todayAmazon reps, including American supervisor Andrew M--- who again refused to keep its promised or: 1) send replacement for broken Echo--free of charge, 2) provide full refund as promised for the forces pay-up-front con job of getting customers to buy yet a second Echo under lie of full refund, (sent this back for refund and had to fight for hours get the purchase price fully refunded), and 3) provide and apply up-front credit for up front purchase of yet another replacement speak --which arrived defective/unusable--So, Amazon still owes me 1) full refunds for all Echo 4s purchased, 2) a replacement speaker for the original speaker it took a year to ""tech expert"" diagnose as defective, and a GIANT APOLOGY for its abusive CS team.Did I mention--- the American supervisor tried to three-card-monte $100 Amazon promo credit (not a gift card or refund) as a ""courtesy"" that he later stated was given ""in hopes this would resolve the issue""---- IE-- sneaky stealing of some $150 and NO apology.  Rejected this sneaky move.  Then he said he couldn't transfer me to his supervisor, only a peer. Then he said he couldn't do that. Then he said he was transferring call to another representative for me to climb the CS abuse ladder again, only to place me on hold for about 10 minutes and transfer me overseas.Update July 18–Amazon STILL hasn’t given me the $160 it owes me. Beat part, the fake silence by CS trick—frequently employed to entice idea call dropped so customer ends call—then denial of such followed by more silence and then click.Update: July 12, 202228+ HOURS --- Trying to get back $160-- for DEFECTIVE ECHO 4Amzon told me I needed Echo 4 generation to supposedly solve the high-repetition ads on ad-free TuneIn Live Premium (commercials are playing as I type this).$80 -- Amazon instructed me to buy Echo 4 coupled with Amazon CS promise of full refund. Amazon delayed unreasonably the refund and then botched it---sending $80 to someone else.This is NOT a refund to me.$80 Amazon billing error ---Same as above.Now I am mired in the obstinate passive aggressive CS battering of emails and call center script reading telling me, essentially to suck it up or go spend hours of your time tracking down the money we gave someone else:""Contact the bank"" we sent it to and ask them to give you your money.----------------------WHAT?-------17 hours and counting --- Fake CS. Tech can't/won't solve problem that speaker doesn't sync. (Installed app several times and unplugged speaker even more---for about an hour. Prior Echo 4 took 5 minutes to one try at plug in to sync. So I know this second one is defective.)Tech ""support"" consists of nothing more than statements of reinstall the app and re plug speaker.Something that didn't solve the problem before fighting through maze of off-shore CS to reach ""tech expert."" Forget that these ""experts"" believe the actual speaker is the reason the Amazon's ad-free streaming service is streaming commercials--which is zany, if not obviously wrong, at face value.But each time this same commercial bludgeoning occurs these ""tech experts"" do nothing more than the re-app, re-plug dance after hours of navigating through layers of what--""tech anti-experts?"""	1	July 8, 2022	0
5	Echo 4th Gen	What I liked – Better bass that my original echos No commercials in my flash briefing It has a hub just like my studios Better bluetooth headphone range than my first gen echos,What I don’t like – There isn’t any switch in settings for local voice control It can’t hear as well as my original echos The sound is in one direction It changes my bluetooth mesh lightbulbs when I turn them onOverall it isn’t a bad upgrade for four generations later than my original echos. But it has some flaws.First it doesn’t seem to have any switch for local voice control. So will the hub work when the internet isdown with my zigbee lights? My studios still control zigbee lights, but not sure if this one can. The newecho has trouble hearing me, but I think this is due to low power mode, as it has to recover before it canlisten. So I have to often repeat commands. The bass is nice and the sound is in one direction more likea normal speaker, but I got used to the 360 degree sound, so this seems a little backward to me. Thesound isn’t bad just different. One thing I hate is the interaction with my bluetooth mesh alexa onlybulbs. If I tell it to turn on light 2, it always turns it on at 100% and white. This is different from mystudios which just turn on the light at the current settings. I keep the downstairs light blue and 5%, if Igo downstairs and say to my studio turn on light 2, it is blue and 5%, if I say turn on light 2 to the gen 4it turns on the light white at 100%.Overall it isn’t bad, I will keep it, but I have the original echo in the closet just in case..	3	July 10, 2022	1
6	Echo 4th Gen	Update: Echo can only hear you about 1/2 of the time. Although this 4th gen Echo has some really nice features that we like, her ability to hear you isn't one of them. We can be standing right in front of her, and our Flex in a hallway on the other side of the house hears us and responds way more than she does. Not kidding. How can it, facing in the other direction walls away hear us and she can't? Our first generation Echo hears us 100% of the time, the 4th gen... maybe 1/3. We put her in the room where we are closest to her when speaking, but it doesn't really help much. In taking away the 360 mics and making her so focused in one direction, they lost something vital. SO majorly annoying. She sounds great, though. Just needs a hearing aid.Original review:The 4th gen Echo has better sound, a built-in smart hub and lots more bells and whistles than my 1st gen Echo, which is five years old and still going strong. I mainly use my Echo to check the weather, time various cooking projects or dog recesses, set zillions of reminders, answer questions, read Audible books, and play a lot of Spotify. What I REALLY, REALLY wanted Echo to do was to be able to call 911.Emergency calling: Within a few minutes of getting the Echo out of its box, it was set up for everything but AT&T and 911 calling. That took a bit of walking through instructions, squirreling off to my iPad (ADD for the win), and then back again to finish setting it up. I was able to connect to my AT&T account on the Alexa app very easily, and specify which devices are at what addresses. Most of our devices are at our home, but one of my daughters has her tablet at her other mom’s house. I loved that I could specify that her tablet was there. Now when I call emergency services (well, I hope never to call), they’ll know where we are if we use one of our Amazon devices. Way too cool!Overall, the sound is better, it has more features, and I really love that I was able to link in calling out on my Amazon devices via my AT&T account. I absolutely love that feature.Better sound is great, too, because I listen to music a lot. The sound is just richer and more detailed. No, this isn’t a Bang and Olufsen, but it sure sounds nice.One caveat. The light ring is on the bottom, so if you have this on a crowded surface as I do, it’s harder to see the light ring. If you have yours in a clear area, just ignore that. But for me, I preordered a wall mount. That will get the Echo raised to where we can see the light ring, and it will also clear the bit of space where I had it.Very pleased with this newest generation of Echo.	3	October 22, 2020	1
7	Echo 4th Gen	I bought a 2nd generation echo when they first came out years ago. I keep it in our kitchen and use it daily for music, news and general inquiries. I have also setup some smart switches so I can control lights using voice through Alexa. When I upgraded to smart thermostats I purchased one that has Alexa built in. I noticed recently that the Echo was not interpreting my requests very well and frequently would not play a song after a request. I assumed it was just getting old so decided to upgrade to this latest device that was on sale during Prime days. I assumed there would be a significant improvement in sound quality but it is marginally better. not enough to justify replacement. I find I need to yell at this echo for it to recognize my voice, the old one worked much better. Lastly, I moved my old 2nd gen echo into the upstairs bedroom thinking I could play music up there but Alexa does not support that. Appears you need to have an individual Amazon account for each device if you want to have it play Spotify. I have a Spotify family account and have no interest in paying for Amazon music premium as well. I am disappointed with this and now I have two echoes that are unreliable when it comes to playing any requested music. I am seriously going to look at Google now.	3	August 1, 2022	1
8	Echo 4th Gen	I am OK with the appearance, though the round ball like profile is too overwhelming, I much prefer the Echo dot. My first complaint is that the newer ball shaped device take more space, LOTS more space. and my MAIN complaint is that Alexa 4gen keeps loosing wifi connections and I need to jump through hoops to get it to reconnect. Sounds like I am a winner, and I may be. Take into consideration that I have limited mobility and un plugging and re-plugging back in the modem, router and ECHO and then accessing the app in my phone to reconnect is just a pain in the ass. I would like to return the ball for a dot, but I doubt that is going to happen. thank you.	3	September 21, 2022	1
9	Echo 4th Gen	"I have had this Echo for over a year now. The sound quality is great and I think each generation gets better. However, the 4th generation microphones can't hear most of the time. I've tried multiple different locations to see if that would help and always get the same results. My 3rd generation Echo dots in other rooms respond before this one will. Once, the Echo finally responds after saying ""Alexa"" 2 or 3 times it then doesn't hear my request so then I have to start all over again. Alexa...silence.. Alexa again...still silent.. Alexa one more time...hey finally a response! Sound a bit to familiar? This must be the teenager version of the Echo...lol! All in all it's a great sounding speaker I just wished it could hear better."	3	September 22, 2022	1
10	Echo 4th Gen	I received my echo’s backin Oct. 22nd 2020.I’ll start out with saying I’m totally blind. I got 2 Echo’ 4thgeneration devices. To me, the sound on the 4th generation echo compared to the full size prior cylinders is worse to me. The 4th generation echo send the sound out mainly in 1 direction. The cylinders sent it out all around.The 4th generation echo comes with a short power cord. Went and got a power cord extender to be able to plug it in. That is a minusThe 4th generation echo doesn’t pick up my voice as well. This is probably because of the fact it only has 4 microphones and not 7. MinusThe buttons Arrangement on the 4th generation echo is different then the prior echo cylinders along with the prior dot’s. The older echo have the Volume up at 12 (Side of power cord coming out), Echo button at 3, Volume down at 6 and Microphone button at 9. The 4th generation echo has the Echo button at 12, Volume up at 3, Microphone at 6 and volume down at 9.Speaking of volume! This 4th generation echo as far as the Alexa voice isn’t as loud. It is at least 1 full volume step lower. Example, the prior cylinder at volume 6, I need to have the 4th generation echo at least at volume 7 for the same Alexa voice volume. MinusIn testing.1. Temperature The 4th generation echo hub will go below 32F. Plus.2. Echo 4th generation echo built in temperature is a lot closer. plus3. Echo 4th generation echo will not read battery status of sensors or humidity. No improvement.4. If you have a lot of sensors/bulbs connected on an Echo ZigBee hub. If you leave it plugged in, things will work OK. Otherwise if you want to move them over to the Echo 4th generation Echo, you’ll need to go through a lot of steps for each device.5. If you unplug the Echo 4th generation and plug it back in, you have to wait for it to recalibrate the temperature sensor 45 minutes to 60 minutes. Minus.6. I’ve had the Echo 4th generation just stop responding and had no audio output at all. I’ve had this happen at least 2 times within the last 7 weeks. Had to unplug the echo and plug it back in to get Audio back. The Echo showed online, I could do drop in to it from other devices in the house, I could tell one of my other echo’s in the house to set volume to 10 on the 4th generation echo and none of that caused audio to come back. The only thing that get the Audio back was unplugging and plugging it back in. Minus7. Sensor/light ZigBee testing echo 4th generation hub. All sensors/lights worked accept for an older plug that I had to use the Alexa App to get it online being the 4th generation echo thought it was an bulb when I did a scan for new devices. minus8. If you connect an Bluetooth headset to the Echo 4th Generation, the echo doesn’t use the microphone on the headset! It only uses the microphones on the unit itself. No improvement9. If you are using an Bluetooth headset and you have Follow-up mode turned on for that Echo, the Follow-up mode doesn’t work at all when using the Bluetooth headset. If you ask the Echo to turn on Follow-up mode, it will tell you it isn’t supported. No improvement10. If you have a fan blowing on the echo or over the echo! This will make the temperature way off! This is true for the Echo 4th generation. No improvementIf you have an old Echo dot! Then you will find a large improvement in the 4th generation echo over a DOT of any type.If you don’t have a echo at all or you are wanting to see what the smart home automation is about and are willing to deal with a very basic ZigBee hub! Then this may be for you.If you have other question; Post them and if I find them and can help I will.	1	December 17, 2020	0
11	Echo 4th Gen	(Update):  Amazon Customer support acknowledged the defect and sent a replacement as the product was under warranty. The new one is working fine so far (day 1) ----I have owned echo since the 1st gen released.  This one is a significant regression when it comes to voice recognition.  Really feel pathetic trading in my first gen for this. Kids stopped using Alexa as they get frustrated that the device doesn't recognize their instructions as well as it did before. Even the echo dot I have upstairs perform better than these.  Amazon does not do a great job of support for the devices.  They did remote diagnostics, sw upgrade etc remotely and eventually said I need to send this for repair which could take anywhere up to 3 months.  Not worth the time and effort.	3	September 10, 2022	1
12	Echo 4th Gen	Bigger than 3rd gen echo, but good sound quality.  Connected easily to my Alexa network.  BUT, I cannot understand why they paired a black echo with a white power cord.  Was this a mistake, because it looks as if I am using the wrong cord.  Cannot use power cords for previous versions of Alexa/Echos.  Small, but extremely irritating issue.	3	October 13, 2022	1
13	Echo 4th Gen	"Okay, so I have 2 of these paired with a Fire 4K TV stick.If I'm only playing music through Amazon's music service... incredible sound and the volume is more than enough for any sane person to thoroughly enjoy.  For reference, we listen at about Volume 4.BUT...When it comes to watching a television show through the Fire 4K stick... it's so frustrating it makes me want to return them.  100% of the time, we set ""Volume 10"", which is maximum volume.  And even *that* doesn't always allow us to hear the dialogue coming through the show.I've tried SO many settings to fix it.  I've paired and unpaired countless times.AND there's more.For some reason, we have to reboot our 4K Firestick every single day before we watch a show.  Otherwise, at some point during the day, it disconnects from the speakers for TV.  And only for TV.  Because if we ask for music, it works just time, every time.Moral of the story:  happy with them for music.  Terrible as a speaker system for television.(Wife is a travel nurse.  We move every 3 months.  I was *hoping* they would be an incredible solution to save space vs. a full audio system.  I was wrong.)"	3	July 11, 2022	1
14	Echo 4th Gen	"I bought an Echo 4th gen and an Echo Dot (4th Gen) in a package.  I've been using them for 9 months now. These devices do play music from Amazon Prime Music account but the Alexa software is pretty buggy.  Example:  For months I couldn't get the two paired Echo devices to play Amazon music (or anything else) on Everywhere group.  Then recently I was able to get that to work, BUT Alexa would only play one song from Amazon music then shut all devices down.  I made sure network connectivity was not the problem. Both Echo devices  are paired and connected to the same wi-fi network.  My Everywhere Group includes both devices.  I could play music all day long on a single device at a time.  Today (9/29/2021) I found that if you start initially playing Amazon music on Everywhere, it will shut off all devices after one song, BUT, if you initially start playing NPR/Kuow (from iHeart Radio) on Everywhere, you can then switch to Amazon music and songs will continue to play.  This is what I mean by ""buggy"".Now for the rest.  The other Alexa features like Lists, Routines, Chore Chart (blueprint), Task Tracker (blueprint) are so far pretty useless.  What I wanted to do was use Alexa to help us  (two adults) manage our time, like keep track of chores, with daily reminders, and keep track of tasks lists for each of us.  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to use more than a single ""list""  or tracker and it better be for a single person.  I created two lists (using Lists & Notes, not Blueprints), one a shopping list, one a to-do list.  Alexa had trouble keeping these lists separated, and adding/removing items at least from voice commands.  I also tried creating a couple of Skills using Chore Chart blueprint and Task List blueprint.  These also did not work for multiple people, and you cannot edit the items without logging into the Blueprints web so it's not very useful for a daily Task List that needs to be dynamic.Bottom line, it has taken 9 months to get this far. I was willing to put some learning time in, but not have to take a class or hire a technician just to get things working.  I find the Echo hardware are adequate speakers for me, but Alexa software is not.  Amazon's online documentation is woefully inadequate, difficult to find and very general.  I did not try the Help & Feedback from the iOS Alexa app since I find reading documentation on a phone screen difficult.  The forums are sometimes helpful if you use suggestions cautiously.  I  have spent a lot of time trying to get Alexa features working, and my lack of success does not make me happy.  I admit my expectations may have been too high."	3	September 29, 2021	1
15	Echo 4th Gen	The speaker sound is horrible. It sounds muffled, unclear and there are no sound adjustment controls for the speaker. .  Unbelievably, my 1ST GEN Alexa has great sound. I wish I could buy another.	3	October 21, 2022	1
16	Echo 4th Gen	"This was a Christmas gift for my 98 year old Grandmother.  My wife and i have an earlier echo generation and love it.  In my grandmother's case she loves the music, and help with reminders.  The problem arose during setup.  To create an account for my grandmother's echo it was required she had an email address.  She is 98 and does not use the internet nor has an email account.  So i elected to include it with my account.  All was good until we found out only one device could stream Amazon Music at a time.  My grandmother's Echo came with a promotional 6 month Amazon Music Premium feature while my wife and i only use the free Amazon Music with our Prime Account.  Suddenly, it became almost a competition where our echo would play one song then request if wanted to move the streaming service to our device.  We would have it and then lose it as my Grandmother at her location did the same thing.  I called Amazon about the problem and spoke with someone with a heavy Indian accent who claimed they could resolve the problem and after 20 minutes dropped the call.  I tried again and got a second Indian representative who was brash, rude, continually talking over me and saying ""just let your 98 year old Grandmother listen to her music!"".  Giving up i tried to politely end the call, where the representative asked if there was anything else he could help with.....  I was hoping i would get a survey about the call, but instead i got an form email from the rep saying it was a pleasure talking with me and he was glad he could help....  No survey.  On the same day this conversation occurred my wife got a charge on her credit card from Amazon for a Prime Membership.  When checking the credit card purchase online i clicked on the merchant who charged her and i was taken to my Amazon Prime Account.....  I did  not purchase a second Prime account and most assuredly not on my wife's credit card.  Well we got that charge cancelled but are still wondering what happened and are living with the competing Echo's.  Yet to be figured out.  The device is very nice....  The Customer Service to help us set it up...  Not so much."	3	January 13, 2022	1
17	Echo 4th Gen	This Alexa worked ok for about 10 months, now a year later it’s either dead some days or dying, it will not pair with our echo dot that is literally 11 ft away and as of a few months ago (a week after the return date expires) we get the response to a request “I’m sorry I didn’t get that” every other day.  It has started making a very loud static noise which interrupts whatever it is the thing is trying to rate.  I have rebooted our internet and the device multiple times to no avail.  Very disappointing Amazon.	3	September 14, 2022	1
18	Echo 4th Gen	Update: I gave more stars back,After this writing this review they called me up to give me a discount on the replacement. I was just about to purchase a new one when they called. I couldn't handle the bad sound it was giving on my favorite songs.  I like that they did that, but still make sure you pay attention to the sound and get more warranty or something. Bought the last one in Sept. of 2021 and it broke by June of 2022.  I had these less than a year. I never raise the volume past 6 most days... over time the sub just stop producing good sound and at some point I'm screaming at it to hear me. I have the bass on 0 and it still have that blown out sound. Like what happened? I'm sure they plan for them to break after a few months so you have to consider buying a new one. My whole house have one in every room or section and I'm thinking about tossing them all out and getting google just because you can whisper to those and they hear you. I also have flex throughout and and set them up to connect to the main echos to respond. I mostly use them for music throughout my place. Very disappointed in how bad they aged in less than a year.	3	June 30, 2022	1
19	Echo 4th Gen	Add the title said,  I was expecting a clock airing and there is no led clock. Nothing in settings and when using voice command... Alexa says this device can't do that	3	October 14, 2022	1
20	Echo 4th Gen	"Almost everything about this Echo 4th Gen is a step backward. Sound has a little deeper bass, otherwise I like the sound of the Echo Plus 2nd gen better.  It does not respond to voice commands as well as the Plus.  It is like it cannot hear you as well.  Having the illuminated ring at the bottom where you cannot see it is just dumb, unless you have it on a glass shelf above head height.  Concerning Echo/Alexa in general, I cannot believe they have not made it any smarter in all these years.  Instead, they are putting all their energy into marketing gimmicks.  If I say the exact name of a song I want to hear, sometimes it will choose one with a similar name rather than the exact title I requested.  Stop doing what you think I want and start doing exactly what I say.  You should only play an alternative if I stated a title that does not exist or was not stated correctly.  I get ""Hmmm, I dont know the answer to that"" to some pretty simple questions as well.  They have it evolved to the knowledgeability of a nine year old and have not evolved it since.  I may begin to look at alternatives, as I cannot support this stupidity much longer.  In large companies, Marketing typically always has the power over Engineering.  I know this, as I am a retired Engineer from a large fortune 50 company.  It is apparent that Amazon is the same way.  I can hear the debate now... ""It won't work as well that way.  Yeah, but it is shaped like a ball and that is cool"".  Start selling the Echo plus again and I may buy one or two more.  Otherwise I am done."	3	May 14, 2022	1
21	Echo 4th Gen	Let me start off by saying I have been a LONG time user of the Echo platform, since gen one and have been a proponent of the platform. I have 20+ echo's and even upgraded some of them as time passes so maybe gone through 30. I just ran across an issue that had apparently popped up sometime last summer but just happened to us as well. I have bought all the Echo's in our family and registered them under my name, pretty standard. Up until we switched phones 3 weeks ago, my wife, who is in my household account, was ALWAYS able to go into her Alexa app and set alarms and reminders on any of our Echo's. As of yesterday that no longer is the case. She can only set alarms or reminders for her phone.I spent 2+ hours texting with 5 people in tech support, got so frustrated that I asked to be connected in person on a call. Talked to two more tech support people on the phone as well. They are telling(insisting) me that only the person who has the Echo registered to their name can set alarms or reminders on those Echo's. So if you have three kids with phones, they can no longer set alarms on any echo device. You can do it verbally still of course. But now if they want an alarm/reminder set in their room they have to walk up the stairs and verbally set it. How does this make ANY sense that only one person in a household can access the alarm/reminders on their mobile devices!?! Takes away half of our functionality!The funny thing is, every one of those techs said that is how it is supposed to work, even though for the last 4+ years my wife has been able to set her own alarms and reminders for our kids. THIS TAKES AWAY HALF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF ECHO'S(if you have a family). That is how she set our kids alarms all through COVID. After a quick google search I found several AMAZON FORUM posts going back a year that this has been happening to other people as well. Just google 'Unable to view or set alarms on Household devices' and you can read for yourself. I screenshotted them as I suspect they will somehow disappear.I think something might be changing at Amazon with the Echo platform and they are slowly taking away this functionality as peoples accounts change or something. I can't make rhyme or reason of it that more people haven't brought this up though. But based on the silly Amazon rep responses and the consistent denial that this was a viable function from multiple Amazon tech's, Amazon appears to have no reason to try and fix this. I suspect they may be rolling out some sort of paid service for Echo's soon. How much money did Bezos lose until Amazon became ubiquitous with everyone was ordering online? He did just recently run up in the annual fee, etc.  Get them a taste or two for free then get them hooked. He is playing the long game for sure. Just my conspiracy theory.Anyways, I will definitely be sending back the other Echo's and thermostats I just bought and may look at switching over to google's devices. Thankfully all my home switches are compatible. Just beware, Echo is no longer nearly as useful for families(or households) anymore and you may want to avoid.	1	July 12, 2022	0
22	Echo 4th Gen	Not enough of a difference from the $10 Echo Dot to warrrant the much higher price.  Good but not special.	3	October 21, 2022	1
23	Echo 4th Gen	I have an echo dot, fire tv cube and a new echo. The microphone on the echo seems less responsive than the old echo dot I have. I can be sitting in the living room, where I have the echo, and when I say, hey Alexa, it doesn’t light up. Often, I can try to play a song in the living room and the echo dot in my bathroom will start playing. Even the fire tv cube in my bedroom responds better than the echo. I even changed the wake words for the devices in case that was the issue, however it may have helped the echo only slightly. The dot still responds from two rooms away, yet the echo doesn’t always respond from ten feet away. Otherwise it is a good device. The sound is much better than the dot. There is distortion if I turn it too loud but even turning it down a little clears it up, and is still plenty loud to jam out while cleaning. 😊	3	July 31, 2022	1
24	Echo 4th Gen	Bought during prime day a month ago, one day Alexa started rattling and warbling like Katherine Hepburn in 'On Golden Pond'. Speaker obviously blown, but never played music loudly. Amazon customer service is OK, but I'm waiting a week-two weeks for a replacement? I should've been sent a replacement first (I had to box up the broken one and ship it back to them at a UPS store) and when the replacement arrived, put the defective one in the same box and send it back. I've been an Amazon Customer for more than 20 years (back to when they only sold primarily books, remember?) I buy practically everything through them and I just see their once legendary customer service and products slipping away	3	August 18, 2022	1
25	Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded from a 2nd gen that I loved... Speakers were great, whisper across the room and it heard me.  I've had the 4th gen for 3 months and absolutely hate it.  The speaker sounds great, but the microphones are terrible.  Pretty much defeats the purpose of having a smart speaker.  I have it sitting on my nightstand 6 to 10 inches from my head and it doesn't hear me.  I literally have to almost yell for it to do anything while lying in bed.  Standing up, I need to right up to it to have it respond to me.  I've reset, de-registered and re-registered, tried all the internet solutions and it still doesn't work.  There is definitely a flaw in the design or components.  Buyer beware, hopefully Amazon can fix the issues.  I am ready to throw this in the trash.***UPDATE: 10/5/22***Still having the same issues with the microphones not hearing me.  I've been contacted by Amazon Outreach Support for comments on my review.  They offered to replace the unit with a refurbished one, but I did not want one that someone else returned for possibly the same reason.The 4th gen has 4 microphones where as the 2nd gen I traded in had 7 microphones.  Why the reduction in microphones?  With my bedroom door open I can yell to my bedroom Echo, with out a response,  and I can hear the 2nd gen Echo downstairs in the living room respond.  It is actually comical at this point.  I no longer have to snooze the alarm since I fully wake up trying to get it to respond.  Something is definitely wrong with this design and lack of microphones.  I've been watching and waiting to see if an updated version is coming out, but still nothing.  Huge disappointment for a great device.We have a total of 7 Echo speakers in the house range from the cube to the dot, varying generations.  By far this is the best sounding, but it is also deaf at the same time.  I dabbled with the idea of replacing my home entertainment speakers with either 2 of these 4th gen and the sub-woofer or an Echo Studio and the sub-woofer, but none have been updated in years.  2020 for the 4th gen and 2019 for the Studio.  I hope new version come out of both speakers and I can make a few upgrades.Bottom line, if you have an older gen Echo and it suits your needs, wait for a better model to be released and skip the 4th gen.	1	September 9, 2022	0
26	Echo 4th Gen	"I love Alexa. It might be more accurately described as a love/hate relationship, but at the end of the day, I Adore that spicy bish. I love asking Alexa  strange questions or just throwing out song requests or a reminder or timer throughout my day, I utilize the crap out of her! Alexa answers are hit and miss, I do receive a lot of ""Sorry, I don't know that"" but all in all the idea behind Alexa is sound. I have owned at least 1 Echo and an echo dot (if available) since its inception, and continue to be impressed with the utility of it. This generation of Echo has been a real disappointment to me. While Alexa is becoming more fluid in this iteration,  in some ways it feels like a rather large step back from its predecessors.  Let's talk about this generations audio, shall we? I dislike that when using verbal commands to Alexa for volume up or volume down, it's  very basic and uses a 1-10 system. This can be modified using the plus or minus sign on the device itself, or using the Alexa app on phones (which, to its credit, allows for a 1% to 100% sliding scale to get the desired volume). However, if you are like me and want to be able to say ""Alexa, set volume to 22%"" Alexa will set the volume to the nearest  1-10 volume, in this case, it would set the Echo to volume 2. As an audiophile this feels clunky and lacks ease of use I've come to expect from Echo devices. The sound quality is alright, but I miss the 360 degree sound that previous generations gave me. Fourth generation Echo's also lack music clarity, and the bass is not impressive in the least.Next up, the shape, sigh. This 4th generation Echo looks like a crystal ball and takes up more space while also being a lot more noticeable. Perhaps this is intentional, but I prefer the more discreet shape of the 3rd generation. I am not impressed with them doing collaborations with designers like Diane Von Furstenberg when so many more necessary features like better audio quality and the Echo's voice sensitivity are sorely lacking. I'd love to see Amazon do a partnership with a company like Boss, to give us useful upgrades and higher audio quality."	3	December 27, 2021	1
27	Echo 4th Gen	"I bought two of these to set up a wireless stereo setup. The bass is insane, to the point where you have to turn it down to hear much of anything else. The midrange is recessed to a nearly objectionable amount, but for the price it's tolerable, I guess.Amazon must do something with spatial audio because the stereo image on these is also insane. Very nice.As for the Alexa thing, I already have four other Alexa eavesdroppers. This is more a review of Echo as an audio device and stereo deal. Short version: don't do it.Linking my two echoes together was easy enough, but one got put in  one ""room"" and one unassigned, and after days I can't for the life of me figure out how to get that other Echo into the same ""room"", but it's just a labeling thing. Connecting them in stereo was simple. Then came the issues.First... these only work in stereo if you stream from an official Amazon(tm) service. That means Amazon music (and probably Prime video). So if you wanted to use these in stereo for TV or YouTube... nope. Doesn't work.And even using this with Amazon Music... is problematic. I have to connect to the pair twice before they start playing, but I can deal with that. But then the Amazon Music app might reset and then I have zero control of what's playing. The speakers keep going on the playlist, somehow, but the app completely loses any sense of what's going on. So seeing what's playing or skipping songs isn't do-able.And as a Zigbee hub... well one works great, but Alexa has no sense of common controls like changing light colors in a group (only individually). It's a great piece of hardware stymied by limited software. There's no reason Alexa couldn't crib notes from every other zigbee app out there, and use my wifi network to stream audio data from one Echo to the others when I bluetooth connect to it. These would make a great little theater setup if they got that to work and kept the sale pricing.Of course, I don't use the thing for Alexa at all, which should probably say something about the strange product planning involved as well. Kudos to the hardware guys, but what is the software group up to?"	3	December 16, 2021	1
28	Echo 4th Gen	I got the echo to use a speaker for my fire stick to stream tv and movies. However, when paired wirelessly the sound was not very good. It sounded like the speaker had a bunch of reverb or something. I tried a bunch of different fixes with the amazon customer service people but nothing worked, so I got a replacement echo but the sound was the same. However, when I connected the speaker to the Fire Stick with an aux cable, the sound was much improved. It is just annoying that I had to do that.So if you were thinking using the Echo as a wireless speaker to stream shows and movies, I would caution against it.	3	August 17, 2022	1
29	Echo 4th Gen	DON'T BUY until Amazon fixes this annoying, completely unnecessary stupid feature.	3	October 16, 2022	1
30	Echo 4th Gen	My 3rg generation echo dot easily connects to my iPhone and iPad.  I have 2 4th generation Echos and neither connects to Bluetooth at all. I have tried all the tricks posted by all the other Echo 4 owners who cannot connect and none works. I have set up and reset up  these Dots (using wifi since blue tooth doesn't work) and it made no difference. There is some defect in these devices. Do not purchase if bluetooth connection is important to you.	3	September 4, 2022	1
31	Echo 4th Gen	This is the fifth Echo device I've purchased.  My 2 previous Echos are the Plus 2nd Generation.  Those are excellent.  I wanted to purchase another of those but this one appears to have replaced that.  First of all I wouldn't consider this to be gray, it looks black.  Second, they supply you with a WHITE power chord instead of black.  This doesn't make sense and it looks stupid.  The chord is also significantly shorter than the chord on my previous devices.  The worst part is the microphone rarely picks up my voice on the first, and sometimes second, try.  I have to yell at it to recognize me.  This is extremely annoying and I never have this issue with my other Echos.  The only plus is that the sound quality when playing music seems to be as good as the Echo Plus.	3	July 24, 2022	1
32	Echo 4th Gen	I own both the full size Echo 4th, and the Echo Dot 4th with LED Clock. I purchased two of the full size Echo 4th devices to allow for connectivity for Ring Bridge devices, notably a Ring Mailbox Sensor and a Ring Lighting Motion Sensor, both of which require either a Ring Bridge, or a Sidewalk Bridge device. This Echo device is specifically named as a recommendation. I gave it a shot, and both the mailbox sensor and the motion sensor went offline repeatedly, even when placed just a few inches from the Echo 4th Gen unit. Sometimes they came back online on their own. Sometimes they ran their batteries dead trying. I returned one of the sensors thinking I had a bad one and got the same results. When I bought a dedicated Ring Bridge, all the problems went away. Sidewalk Bridge simply isn't working and isn't reliable.As for the other features, the audio quality when listening to music or just hearing Alexa's voice is very boomy by default. I haven't tried playing with the equalizer, but really, I should be able to get decent quality from default settings.Voice recognition is hit-or-miss if you're not using Alexa as your wake word. It doesn't seem to matter much if you're facing the unit directly when you speak to it or if you're just somewhere in the room. Recognition is about the same either way, for better or worse.The unit itself is HUGE, and the audio is comparable to the Echo Dot 4th Gen, so if you're faced with a choice between the two and don't need Sidewalk, I'd recommend the Echo Dot.Lastly, the surface is covered with cloth, meaning that cleaning it isn't much of an option. I suspect that at some point, mine will look dingy enough from touching the buttons that I'll want to re-wrap it. Or maybe I should do that preemptively. Does anyone make custom skins for this thing?	3	January 23, 2022	1
33	Echo 4th Gen	"I bought this Alexa ball after realizing the marketing kings already know everything about me anyway, so might as well have this listening in. My phone, TV, and I think it must be my rug or something, already knows even what I'm thinking about.Anyway, I was hoping it could change my TV channels at least, but that involved buying another gizmo. OH --""PREMIUM SOUND"". Not sure what that means but it isn't hifi Bose quality. More like enhance AM radio.That voice ... annoying, so I changed it. It says you can change the voice, but its only male of female. And they say you can change the wake up name. There are only a couple that you can choose from a list as well. All with multiple syllables, and I want a one syllable name..like JOE... Hey Joe. So it stays Alexa with a male voice.I love the shape and look, and with the added light at the base, it looks pretty cool. It would be even better if the entire globe radiated soft pastel colors and then jumped bright red when someone is detected at the front video doorbell You could keep the yellow for when a package is delivered by Amazon.THe jokes are pretty corny. The weather report is great, and it can tell you what temperature is residing at its location. Overall use for TV is great if you have a Fire TV. It wants to go to Fire TV over ROKU or even cable. Changing cable using the Fire TV Blaster is a bit hit or miss. It doesn't respond the same to even the same command to change the channel. Overall using Alexa to control the TV is hit or miss anyway. Much easier to just use the remote.My overall assessment is that it's a cool gimmick, not really practical. That might be me though, as I'm old. A longtime tech-head, but an old one. Sometimes cool factor of a product isn't worth the bother."	3	January 6, 2022	1
34	Echo 4th Gen	I do not like the sound quality. I get richer, clear sound with a $15 Bluetooth speaker. As for Alexa integration: it’s a useful as the Dot but getting it to work with SmartLiving isn’t going at all. It’s not very inclusive. Sooo, out of step with society. C’mon, Bezos! Get a better design team	3	September 20, 2022	1
35	Echo 4th Gen	I bought a pair of these. A 4K fire stick and the sub. It was a bit of a challenge to get everything connected and working. The sub is decent, not super loud if that’s what you are going for. Once you connect the 2 echos with the sub you can’t change any of the sound settings individually.We listen to SiriusXM a lot and it keeps dropping the signal and going to static. Spotify works fine. Not sure why it doesn’t seem to like satellite radio. We have very strong wifi with a mesh system so it’s not a wifi issue.Overall the echos and sub combo sound good and it does the job of deleting a soundbar under my tv above my mantle. You’re not getting theater quality sound but it’s good for the price on prime days.	3	July 27, 2022	1
36	Echo 4th Gen	I like almost everything about this product.Unfortunately, it announces “NOW CONNECTED TO [DEVICE NAME]” whenever you activate it.If you’re connecting this as a PC speaker be prepared to be woken up at 2am when your PC installs a random update and restarts.Research this issue online and you’ll see it has been known for years and Amazon does nothing to fix it. There are a few bandaids you can stick on like restarting the device, but none of them work over time.Absolutely stunning lack of consideration to how the thing will be used in real life. The worst part is I’m sure they could easily patch this online (other people have literally developed desktop applications to override the functionality) but they just…don’t.	3	August 2, 2022	1
37	Echo 4th Gen	After using this for a few weeks there's definitely more negatives about this new model.  Compared to even the Gen 1 Echo Dot, its comprehension of what you're saying or ability to even hear you on the first try is not nearly as good.  Our old Echo Dot could hear us well from the other room, this one doesn't hear us on the first try 60% of time - from only a few feet way!  I've had enough experience with family members' earlier gen Echos to know this device is also inferior to them.The ball shaped, cloth coating gets dirty VERY quickly in a kitchen environment.****November 24, 2020****I purchased this Echo due to its ability to connect with Philips Hue bulbs without a hub.  The product is new enough that Amazon tech support does not understand that the Echo 4th generation does not work with Philips Hue bulb model LWB004. I have 2 of them and spent way too long on the phone trying to sort it out.  I ended returning my new Echo and getting again with a bundle of 2 new Hue bulbs (Model 453100).  Those Hue bulbs worked immediately and easily.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.  Definitely distortion on the maximum volume that is not there in older models.The size and shape are not as problematic as I thought it would be.  It does feel like it will be prone to getting damaged by kids more than the older coffee can version of the Echo design.In the end though, it is still cheaper than an Echo Dot plus a Philips Hue Hub.  And the Echo 4th gen certainly sounds better than an Echo Dot.  Additionally,  I am one of the people who got burned by Philips shutting off access to the first generation Hub, so I am happy to not be forced into buying another Hub from them.The sound quality is is a step back from the the previous Echo models.

38	Echo 4th Gen	"Aside from the ""by the ways"" that force me to wait, here's my experience with Alexa this afternoon.I set 2 timers for a nap. After they rang, I set another 30-minute timer (I know I nap quite a bit). However, after the new timer is set, the old timer kept ringing. So I said to Alexa with my dreamy eyes, ""Alexa, turn off the alarm"" to which Alexa replied, ""there is no active alarm.""Thinking that the 30-minute timer is canceled too, I told Alexa again, ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes."" It replied, ""Second alarm set for 30 minutes."" Frustrated, I then told Alexa to clear all timers and set just 1 alarm for 30 minutes, to which it replied, ""Third alarm set for 30 minutes.""Not wanting three alarms to go off one after another, I asked Alexa to clear all timers. Alexa then read to me, that I have 3 active timers set, with the FIRST timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, the SECOND timer set to 30 minutes X minutes X seconds remaining, the THIRD timer set to 30 minutes and X minutes X seconds remaining, which one did I want to cancel. I said ""all of them."" Alexa then said ""timer all of them"" was not found and then hung up on me. I then had to tell it to cancel my timers again. It repeated the same information about each of the timers, which took a very long minute, and then proceeded to ask me which timer I wanted to cancel again. ""You have a 30-minute timer with 23 minutes and 40 seconds left, a 30-minute timer with 25 minutes and 12 seconds left, and a 30-minute timer with 26 minutes and 23 seconds left. Which timer would you like to cancel?""""The 30-minute timer."" I replied.""Fourth timer, 30 minutes, starting now.""----------------------------------------------------------------Although I have now figured out that I needed to say to Alexa ""clear all timers,"" frustrations like these and all the unwanted advertising are still making me want to just donate Alexa to charity. Maybe I will someday."	2	August 17, 2022	0

40	Echo 4th Gen	It does what it is supposed to do as far as be an Alexa speaker.  The sound is lackluster and lacks any punch	3	September 28, 2022	1
41	Echo 4th Gen	This is our 3rd and worst Echo. Hasn’t heard voice commands on several occasions!	3	October 7, 2022	1
42	Echo 4th Gen	". . . seems to have been wiped from the face of the Earth.I read the specs and thought ""why not"". So I was having problems with my Gen 2, had a conversation with Tech Support and they said that the Gen 4 was many steps ahead in many of the problem areas that I was having. SO, I traded it in (big mistake), Gen 2 and got a good price on the Gen 4. But it turned out to be the ""Alexa System"" itself and still is. I still have the same problems. If not more as things seem to be degrading. And the design of the Gen 4 doesn't help at all with salient interaction. But now I have them with the inadequacies of the Gen 4 Bowling Ball. (Whomever thought of that should be . . . )As with all the other features, they're over hyped. Including the ones that they are releasing as if it's the 12 Days of Christmas. I have too much Bass even though I have backed it off in the settings. The device rattles as if there is ""FUD"" in the speaker cavity and rattles every thing that is in the vicinity. It also distorts easily and there seems to be no common volume settings/volume leveling, I know there are settings, they don't work, across all systems that provide material. The volume seems to be doing it's own thing. I've seen this said in a couple places. Even the ""Adaptive Listening"" is the epitome of wonky. It seems to operate just the opposite for what they say. I get all my music and podcasts lower than ""She who shall not be named"" and when ""She"" chimes in, it's blaring! The ""Increased User Vocal Sensitivity Pickup"" is nothing like they profess or the Gen 2 was. I have found, so has my family, that I have yell to get it to hear me. And repeat myself a lot!! The way it's designed it has a ""Front"" that you have to be inline with or it doesn't work right. ""What happened to the guy that created this thing?!"" The Gen 2 responded to a normal talking level from 360°. ""She"" was just dumb. As they all are. The new ""Infra-Red Motion Sensing"" says that it's calibrated so that it reads things in a normal manner to avoid natural and not intentional movement. So it'll see a person when it's necessary and operate appropriately. ""So your don't have to wave your arms around in front of it"". YES YOU DO!AND with all this volume adjusting using the buttons on the top, HOW IN THE HECK DO YOU KEEP IT CLEAN?!!! I had though of putting it in a bowling ball cleaner at the lanes, but . . .There's so much just pain wrong with the whole situation in the first place that only make a half-arsed device, even more half-arseder. My Routines are no longer working completely. Sometimes they will completely fire off, to my surprise. But mostly not. Will fire off bit and pieces of a Routine if it cares. I'm having a heck of a time getting some devices to connect and once they are ""She"" snarfs them up and it's like having Double Natting in a Router. Other times I won't even be done and ""She"" says she sees it already and I haven't named it yet, so there's more work to make it right. And it doesn't always work.Oh! I have changed the voice over to the ""Male"" voice so I don't feel as bad cussing at it. But ""He's"" still dumb. Just like the ""pre-Demon"" Hemsworth in the ""Female"" version of ""GhostBusters"".Not sure what they are up to . . . I don't think they are either . . ."	2	December 25, 2021	0
43	Echo 4th Gen	Great sound quality but this echo is worse at waking up on the command word than previous generations.The new inside temperature feature is cool but is often wrong (by 10+ degrees) so is somewhat unreliable.	3	September 17, 2022	1
44	Echo 4th Gen	Not crazy about the sound.  Not as good as the older tower style. It also drops connect with web more often. I also noticed it doesn't hear as well and I have to repeat my alexa commands.	3	September 21, 2022	1
45	Echo 4th Gen	"Although it is much larger than my old Echo Dot,  the voice clarity is not nearly as good.  It sounds 'muffled"" Also, at times, it has difficulty in understanding me."	3	September 21, 2022	1
46	Echo 4th Gen	I like that it's loud when I listen to my music. What I don't like is when the Alexa is not able to hear me or understand and it glyches out sometimes.	3	September 21, 2022	1
47	Echo 4th Gen	Horrible mic and it’s never worked right. I called Amazon and they had me do a reset which made it work okay for about 5 mins then the same thing happened where you have to stand over the top of it to get it to hear you. For the record I have tons of these devices and most work great but this thing is junk.	3	September 2, 2022	1
48	Echo 4th Gen	I have owned every echo since their inception . And one fact is true ... amazon has done a very good job with making small improvements while keeping the costs down . This latest design is once again a minor improvement on the previous generations I own . The sound has improved a bit . Slightly more bass and treble . Still not a Sonos or a Bose ... but the cost isn’t either . So it’s a compromise . Glad they finally just included the “hub” instead of 2 separate models . The design being a sphere is up for debate . One thing that isn’t ... it’s no longer a omnidirectional speaker . It sends sound where you point it . So unfortunately you can’t bounce the sound off a wall to increase the bass like previous generations  . The look ? Meh ... kinda weird . But not a deal breaker . One complaint I have as well as others : the led indicator that lets you know it’s listening is now on the bottom . Terrible placement . You just can’t ever see it ! If it was higher or if it was much brighter perhaps . 2 things that I’m not happy about at all  : 1) like others have said ... the microphones are no longer as sensitive as other generations . My older echos almost never miss when I ask a question , even clear across the house . This one ? I very often end up screaming at it , especially when the music is playing . Even when I’m just a few feet away. It seems as though there are either less microphones or the ones on this model are not as discerning. Perhaps a software update in the future will improve this . ( note : I am not alone in my evaluation - others are having the same issue) 2)  My biggest dislike ? I purchased 2 black / charcoal echos ... and they give you white power cords with white power blocks ! White ? Seriously ? No doubt this is a cost saving measure so that they include the white ones across the board no matter what you order . But ... they are ugly as Hell ! They do not blend in at all . Hopefully they listen to all of us complaining and change this - as well as swap out our white ones for black ones . Amazon pulled a Henry Ford with the model T . You can have any color you want ... as long as it’s Black ! One last thing - terrible WiFi reception !	3	December 23, 2020	1
49	Echo 4th Gen	This seems like it would be a useful, hands-free device, but so far we're not impressed. The AI seems weak and always interested in sending us to some subscription site. The weight of the plug causes the plug to fall out of the wall socket. I assume it's Alexa trying to avoid having to deal with us :) The speaker quality is decent, but not really outstanding. It can get loud, but the bass is dull IMHO and muffles clarity at times.Anyway, if you like shouting commands at someone repeatedly (maybe you're a drill sergeant or unhappily married), then this might be a diverting toy for you. More seriously, though, if you have restricted mobility or you live alone, then this device could be a real time/effort saver if you have it hooked up to other devices in your home (e.g., lights, tv, wall thermometer). You should be aware that there is a trade off between your privacy and the detail of your personal experience. For example, Alexa will want access to your contacts if you use it for calling folks via your wifi (your internet connection). And, it wasn't so long ago that people were able to hear others' conversations and command history. BTW: This is information you can look up via your Amazon account. So, travel with caution and ask yourself whether voice commands are superior to the discretion of silently typing your searches (which are archived is a cloud unless you disable the feature). I'll update this review once I've had more experience with the device, but right now, it seems that an Apple iPad does pretty much the same things (with Siri) and video availability (though at a much greater cost).	3	December 27, 2021	1
50	Echo 4th Gen	When integrating my Ring smart LED there is an option for a 4th Generation Echo. Instead of buying the Ring Bridge I bought this instead. It’s a great Alexa - horrible bridge. Even the level 2 Ring tech support says it barley works with the Ring devices - they’re right…	3	September 4, 2022	1
51	Echo 4th Gen	I’m a bit disappointed with the Echo device. The sound is definitely an improvement compared to the previous models. The voice recognition does not work very well in my case in addition the echo moves on my desk because of vibrations when I play loud music	3	August 27, 2022	1
52	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa works great but the sound honestly sounds like it is being played from a hollow drum. Not crisp and no bass. Mediocre at best.	3	September 20, 2022	1
53	Echo 4th Gen	Initially we loved bringing Alexa into our home. As time has passed, her own voice sounds very tinny and echo-ey. It randomly comes on, as though it is listening in on our conversations. I feel as though 9 times out of 10 that it asks us to repeat questions or requests, which it Did Not do in the first months of use. We keep it clean and have not changed anything in the home that would effect this. Thinking that it's just another electronic device that is made to self destruct so that you have to buy a new one.	3	July 26, 2022	1
54	Echo 4th Gen	General Annoyance - I bought this with the free globe offer - amazon lost it in delivery - there was no way to speak to anyone on their app so I just had to cancel it. BUT Cancelling it was difficult because it mysterious vanished from my recent orders, which seems devious as it was supposed to be a free included item - but I am hoping I am refunded its full price.PROsI new I wanted this for Spotify playing so I paid more to get the better speaker, and as I can connect it via bluetooth to my TV Soundbar /Bass it even sounds better. So overall happy but in truth I am no sound expert /musicphile.CONs- If you don't have an American accent and you want to set it to yours, you apparently lose functionality in the US but its not clear on what functionality to make it an easy choice.- I have it announce my Calendar but it does it twice. You can set the reminders to only announce once but it doesn't work for the calendar integration - its really annoying.- I like to clear up and delete my history - don't see any need for Amazon to have it. But to delete Activity you have to delete each Activity card and its like two taps. Again really annoying.- I have noticed things mysterious turn themselves on and off since setting this up. Can't tell if it's Alexa or the apps running the connected items to it. I don't see anything in Alexa history to suggest its Alexa and I haven't investigated further. i.e Xbox and lights mysteriously turn on.	3	December 9, 2021	1
55	Echo 4th Gen	I traded in my Echo Premium cylinder for this device in 2020 all of a sudden, it doesn't connect any longer. Tech support refuses to replace it, and the price for my original device is 150, yet this one is 50 dollars, and you cannot trade it in. That does not make any sense whatsoever. I'd rather have my original device back. I feel like they sold me a cheap device and know it is not worth their time after letting me purchase it.Shame on Amazon for this tactic.	3	July 27, 2022	1
56	Echo 4th Gen	I currently have a 2nd Gen Echo and 2 Echo Dots. I listen to the 2nd Gen Echo the most and decided to give this a try to upgrade the sound. My favorite thing about the Alexa products is being able to network them together into groups. The sound quality on this was a step up from my 2nd Gen. That is where the good stops. This device would frequently stop playback altogether. Whether it was Amazon Music, a Flash Briefing or a 3rd party app it would just stop playing. I could not get my devices to play in a group with this device as part of the network. All my devices were hooked up to the same 2.4 ghz wifi network. I deleted and re-added all the devices multiple times. I spent countless hours on the phone with support. Everything worked fine until I added in this devices. When I removed it, the groups worked fine. The last straw was when it was in the middle of delivering a severe weather notification and it just stopped working. I will stick with the older, slightly less great sounding tech because it reliable works. This is getting returned.	3	April 25, 2022	1
57	Echo 4th Gen	Of course it doesn’t always do what it is supposed to do but that is technology sometimes. My main issue is that I have started noticing a static sound when playing my music. It reminds me of when a speaker is blown or real close to it. I never turn the music up loud and I don’t use it often for music either so I’m surprised at the quality. It is not even a year old. That is just a little disappointing.	3	August 5, 2022	1
58	Echo 4th Gen	I had to buy a new, more expensive, larger, uglier Alexa device because the old one could not connect devices on a modern Wi-Fi router with 5G. She is not capable of answering almost any question, including her own model or specifications. And after a dozen tries, she still could not connect to my device. Alexa used to be far simpler, far less expensive, and work far better.Is it time to convert to Google smart home, or is that just as bad?Addition: After posting this review, Amazon Customer Service called me and was able to assist me in connecting this Echo to my devices. I have added two stars to reflect that service.I remain disappointed that I had to buy two new Echoes and devices to connect to them merely because Comcast replaced my router with a newer model. And it is still the case that this Echo provides less assistance than the older models I had.  Also, having lived with it for a few days, I have noticed that the sound quality is worse than the older models, even though it looks like it has a bigger speaker.	3	May 6, 2022	1
59	Echo 4th Gen	"My friend said she couldn't get it to understand her. I tried speaking with a ""proper english"" accent and it worked fine. I guess it doesn't respond well to ebonics....SMH."	3	September 4, 2022	1
60	Echo 4th Gen	Could not get Alexa to connect to this Echo.	3	September 25, 2022	1
61	Echo 4th Gen	I bought two of these during a sale and traded in my 1st and 2nd generation devices. They are solid units, but fall short in the following ways:1) Voice recognition not as good as previous generations. There are times when I attempt to wake the device up and have to shout. I was able to wake the other devices up with more of a conversational tone. There are also times when it doesn't appear to be able to process what I said, so it will just disregard everything and not say anything.2) The speaker is good, but I can see why others have complained about it not being 360. One of my devices is placed facing the dining area. When I am in the kitchen, the music does not sound as good since it is facing away from me. This was not an issue with the 2nd generation is previously replaced.3) Not a big deal, but it would be nice if they sent out a darker cord with the dark colored units. They did this previously.In the end, if your device needs to be replaced or you don't currently have one, then this is a solid device. If you have a 2nd generation (or higher), then maybe skip this one.	3	February 28, 2022	1
62	Echo 4th Gen	The device itself is great, good sound. However Alexa‘s voice recognition software continues to get worse. it’s becoming more and more frustrating to deal with her.	3	September 6, 2022	1
63	Echo 4th Gen	UPDATE 11/19/2020The speaker doesn't pick up my voice as well as the Gen 1 echo - find myself repeating commands more frequently. I was able to connect a Philips Hue bulb and it seems to be working well as a hub - it's a nice feature. The temperature sensor seems to be working well. I'm not a fan of the lights being underneath reflecting off the surface. It's more difficult to see them and I miss the large rotating volume knob which is much more intuitive to use. It was impossible to add the new speaker to my existing speaker group - seems to be a bug of some sort with the Alexa app (iOS). I couldn't stream to the device using my Amazom Music app, also seems to be a bug of some sort with the app (iOS).ORIGINAL REVIEW 10/23/2020I was hoping the audio quality of the 4th gen was going to be better than my first gen echo. I listened to them side by side and the don't sound THAT different - not worth the cost of replacement. The new version is louder, has slightly more pronounced bass and fills the room about the same when against the wall. The sound of the new one seems unbalanced. The highs are tinny and overbearing. Mids are understated and the bass is so-so. Overall the sound is top heavy and flat.Its width takes up a lot more space, about double over the first gen. The buttons on top are kind of difficult to press - they're hard to feel without looking, shaped into small symbols instead of chunky round buttons and not that responsive. The original echo's buttons were easier to navigate without looking.I don't mind the white cable because it blends in better with the white walls.If you don't mind having 2 devices, I would suggest going with an echo dot and buying a good quality bluetooth speaker. The flexibility of taking the speaker elsewhere with you and the sound quality will be much better.	3	October 23, 2020	1
64	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is fine.Has told me hundreds of times that the only way to play specific songs is with amazon music, implying that deezer and spotify or anything other than amazon will not work on the device.Amazon should really correct this.Impossible to sign in to a hotel wifi that has its own sign in screen.Only device I have that does not connect to the wifi in my home, though it does connect to mobile hotspot.Seems to listen and record sometimes when I don't use the wake word.Usually horrible with foreign language artist recognition.Often not that intuitive with basic questions.Too bulky and heavy to be considered a good travel speaker.Mixes up accounts in my family, and will ask things like would I like to reorder medicine.Gives notifications of everything my Mom ordered for Christmas, even after I turn off notifications.Customer support is good, though if there is a problem with the device you are required to mail it to them even if you are in another country.Really the ease of use of the technology is quite unimpressive.Children like talking to alexa.The worst is setting up a new wifi, amazon should really improve this.I think my next smart speaker purchase will be a sonos or a google, because what do I have to lose?The only thing making me stay with amazon is that they allow deezer in every country I have been to so far, with google its hit or miss.Overall, I went from really enjoying Amazon smart speakers to almost dreading the experience.	2	August 23, 2022	0
65	Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded from the original Alexa.  I have trouble getting sound set to good volume and hoped it was better. IT IS NOT!  This design is more difficult to adjust sound manually and does not respond as well to my voice.  I need to speak much louder.  I wish there was a way to adjust sound in smaller increments with my voice.	3	August 11, 2022	1
66	Echo 4th Gen	Generation 4 Echo has very good musical and general sound improvement as compared with Generation 2 Echo.In our experience, Generation 4 Echo Microphones seem to have more difficulty picking up voice commands in the same exact locations perviously occupied by Generation 2 Echos.  Occasionally it takes 2-3 attempts to get 4th Gen Echos to respond as compared to Gen 2 Echo units.  We purchased three new Gen 4 Echo units and they all exhibit the same characteristic.	3	July 29, 2022	1
67	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality to me was less good than the earlier version of Echo I had planned on returning for offsetting credit. So I kept both and combined them. With that configuration, I am now obtaining what I think is good sound quality	3	August 21, 2022	1
68	Echo 4th Gen	"Where to even start... this is the worst Echo device I own.I have several generations of dots that have better sound & can hear me without me having to yell... I bought this to replace my original Echo, which was taller but (to me at least) more aesthetically pleasing all around.But the look of it is besides the point... it rarely recognizes what I have to say which never happened on any other device, & I have to yell at it- because talking to it induces ""whisper mode"" which I can say from other echo devices is usually because you are ACTUALLY whispering to the device.It's a complete failure on sound quality when playing music... and to add insult to injury, they may call the device color ""glacier white"" but it's more a ""dirty snow grey""... now onto a less significant, but equally annoying detail... why did they make this round? It's wider than my old Echo, & the material just collects dust... the whole device is truly a heinous monstrosity I can't wait to be rid of if/when they come out with another version that is no longer this shape or low quality.The only reason this gets 2 stars is because I like the thermostat feature & I got it on sale so I can't complain about its price (other than it's not worth sale price let alone full price)... I honestly don't know why Amazon created this, & I hope they go back to a device that has better sound quality and voice recognition instead of focusing on a design that is ultimately superfluous at the end of the day (not to give permission to make it any uglier, but please prioritize function over form next time!)"	2	August 2, 2022	0
69	Echo 4th Gen	"I have to repeat commands very often. So is the microphone bad?The circling light in the Echo interferes with sleep. Echo software does not provide a ""switch off"" all lights feature. So I had to be creative. I purchased a bag of 4"" diameter rubber gaskets on Amazon.

70	Echo 4th Gen	voice recognition spotty at times,, still with issues with finding the right song or version of a song even when you say the name of the song and the artist	3	August 25, 2022	1
71	Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded to an echo 4 gen from an echo 2 gen and finding the 4 doesn't seem to hear me as well as the 2. Sometimes I have to repeat myself. Sometimes I'll give a command to turn on the bedroom light and it turns on the dining room light instead which is puzzling as they don't sound similar. The bass is good but music doesn't sound much better than the 2.  It's not overwhelming. I may end up resetting the 2 back up.	3	July 18, 2022	1
72	Echo 4th Gen	So I bought this to replace a 2nd gen echo plus with the smart home hub because I was trying to find a regular 3rd gen echo (the taller rounded one) to set up a stereo pair with but found them all discontinued. So i bought this version (renewed) and put the other echo downstairs. The sound quality is pretty good but I feel it's not as strong or has the same bass response as the original echo plus. Haven't set another echo up with it yet so I'll hold off on my audio judgements. In terms of voice recognition, this thing can't hear me calling it half the time when I'm in bed only 3 feet away, the other one was better with that. Not only can't it hear me, but half the time it doesn't respond correctly or perform the right action I request. For the price this thing should have the clock built in as a standard feature that you can disable at will. I'm going to buy the matching regular echo, but I gotta say I feel like this unit is a downgrade from my OG echo plus.	3	April 15, 2022	1
73	Echo 4th Gen	One has to bend to see if the ring color is blue at all or any color. It's not very clear. Again, wish these devices are cordless so that I can keep her anywhere such as on top of the shelf etc. Sometimes Alexa respond I don't know about that, actually earlier she might have responded correctly. So this feels weird when she says I don't know about that. I hope Alexa doesn't have memory loss 🙂	3	July 23, 2022	1
74	Echo 4th Gen	i love my echos i have 6 echos. all generation but this one you have to repeat constantyly wish i could return it and get another 3rd gen plus but cant find them	3	August 23, 2022	1
75	Echo 4th Gen	"Update: 28 Jan 2022I've really had it with this thing; it's a hot, steaming pile.  I recently went through a phase where the ring would light yellow, letting me know that there were new notifications waiting.  I'd say, ""Alexa, read my notifications,"" and the Echo would tell me that I had no notifications.  Asking a second time would usually result in success.  Then this morning, the Echo decided to shout to the world that we'd added breakfast sandwiches to our shopping list.  Mind you, I NEVER touch the volume controls -- on the device or on the app -- except to reset them when the Echo decides to shout at me.  This morning it shouted so loud that it woke two of my children on ANOTHER FLOOR.  I'm done with this piece of junk.  It's now packed away in my basement, and I've brought my Gen1 back online.----------I was an early and aggressive adopter of Echo products over the years.  I bought my Gen1 Echo during the pre-release phase, have had several Dots, and now have several Shows as bedroom alarm clocks.  So when I bought my Gen4 Echo to replace my original Gen1, I did so with great expectations.  Let me tell you how disappointed I am.The first thing I noticed was that when paired to my iPad (which sits right next to the Echo on my kitchen island), the audio frequently crackles and drops.  This was never an issue with my Gen1, and the behavior has persisted across pairing to my iPhone and two different iPads.  That makes me pretty confident that the issue is in the Echo, and not in the attached devices.The next major issue is with volume control on the Gen4.  I still haven’t figured it out.  I have tried the on-device controls and the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app, but there seems to be no logic to what volume the Echo responds to me.  I can ask Alexa for a weather report and all is fine, then a few seconds later ask Alexa to add something to my shopping list, only to hear the Echo shout the response.  The Echo will announce a reminder softly, and then boom my notifications when I ask.  Adjusting and re-adjusting the Volume and Sound settings in the Alexa app solves the problem temporarily, but the issue resumes not long after.More recently, the Echo has started playing music after announcing reminders or playing announcements.  It wasn’t playing music before, and no one asked it to start playing music; it just does it on its own.  (This behavior was kind of funny the first few times, but now I’m getting tired of telling the Echo to stop playing music after it tells me to take out the trash or clean the guinea pig cage…)And then there’s the “spinning blue ring issue” that seems to have cropped up recently.  Frequently over the last few days, I’ve caught the Echo with the light ring illuminated blue, with a slightly brighter blue indicator spinning round and round.  It will do this for minutes at a time, stop, and then just start doing it again later.  During this time, the device is non-responsive.I never saw these issues with the Gen1, nor do my Shows seem to have so many issues.  But I’m thoroughly disappointed with the Gen4.  It truly makes me wish I had my Gen1 back.  My opinion:  Save your money and avoid this one.  Maybe the Gen5 will be better."	1	December 15, 2021	0

77	Echo 4th Gen	"Naturally I like being able to just say, ""Alexa, turn on the lights,"" or ""Alexa, set the heat (temperature) to ## degrees"" in order to accomplish these tasks. On these winter days, I especially like being able to turn up the heat from the comfort of my bed by invoking Alexa. But all this just increases my disappointment when Alexa just doesn't seem to get what I am requesting, even when I am taking great care to be very clear. Even worse is when Alexa appears to go on strike and just not respond to my requests at all. I dread hearing her frequent plaint, ""I'm sorry. I'm not understanding right now. Try again later."" In addition to these complaints, I have to add that Amazon is still far from the top of its game when it comes to the sound quality of its Echo devices--at least this one. If Amazon is going to tout ""premium sound,"" it should certainly do better. When Alexa speaks, she sounds as if her face is buried in a pillow, and music is by no means crisp, clear, or well balanced. What bass response there is does not make up for imbalances over the rest of the frequency range, which Alexa's equalizer function seems unable to adequately adjust. To sum up: Echo 4th Generation is still not ready for prime time."	3	January 6, 2022	1
78	Echo 4th Gen	A very poor “whole house” audio solution. What little usefulness it has is just a hook to make you pay for and become reliant on amazon music unlimited. Unless you swallow that bait it is a poor and inconvenient option. Even if you can find enough “free with Prime” music that you want to listen to, it won’t let you add more than 20 songs to a playlist. Any function that doesn’t further Amazon’s ability to sell you more stuff or subscribe to more stuff, is just ignored and unaddressed.“Whole House Audio”??? That’s a joke. It won’t let you play your own music from your phone on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play radio apps on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play audio books on the “everywhere group”. It won’t let you play the audio from a Bluetooth-connected TV on the “everywhere group”. Basically it’s a novelty item that is WAY oversold as a whole house audio solution. It is only “whole house audio” for being tied to Amazon’s pay streaming music.If music is playing on one unit, and you ask it to continue playing the music on the “everywhere group”: First, it will tell you that you can’t play music on the “everywhere group” because music is already playing on another unit. But It’s not playing on another unit. It is playing on the unit you are talking to. So it will force you to stop playing the music and then make a new music request to be played on the everywhere group. I have yet to be able to get it to continue playing the same music it was originally playing on the everywhere group. Continuity is awful (non-existent). Amazon is primarily concerned with selling you the unlimited subscription, instead of responding to a reasonably foreseeable request in a manner that enhances your listening continuity as you move around the house.Let’s say you’re getting ready in the morning and you want Alexa to tell you the news. Don’t expect to able to move around from room to room because it will only play that news audio on one unit. Not on the everywhere group, or on another smaller group. If you move to a different room that has  another unit, your only option is to replay the news from the very beginning again and listen to what you have listened to already over again.None of these problems are beyond the technical ability of the Echo units. Some of the problems are intentionally created obstacles just to try to force you into paying for unlimited. Others problems remain unaddressed because they wouldn’t help (or hurt) Amazon to sell you more “stuff”.So you’ve spent a few hundred dollars on echo units for around your house? Good luck with that. Don’t expect true whole house audio and don’t expect them to work together as a group of units. All you did was purchase the “gateway drug” for Amazon’s selling machine.	2	December 22, 2021	0
79	Echo 4th Gen	Not sure if it is my ears, but my Echo plus gen 1 to me,has better sound quality. Gen 4 is a bit flat, bland and sounds almost mono.However I know my eyes don't lie.This thing is more ugly in person!  Its like a throw back from the 70s.Noticed that response time is a tad slower.Did I get a defective ugly blue  orb ?Amazon,  Please bring back the cylinder design and sound quality.	3	July 15, 2022	1
80	Echo 4th Gen	I have one of these in my bedroom and it works out pretty well. The new one just doesn't perform as well. I request a song and she kinda plays whatever she wants. Sounds quality is not as good as the older one.	3	August 6, 2022	1
81	Echo 4th Gen	I had purchased this Echo to replace my 1st generation Echo Plus.  The mics on the Echo plus were a little sluggish so I thought why not upgrade and move my echo plus to another part of the house that is less used.  Well the new Echo showed up a little early and I even went through the payment plan.  I thought that the new generation should have all kinds of woops and whistles than what I originally had.Well the first thing that I enjoyed was the integration of dual languages.  With me learning Spanish this I thought would be a fun feature.  Well it seams that this version has still a lot of issues.  My commands are not recognized very often.  When I try to play something from xm it just errors.  I have to use my echo show to play on the network I choose.  Now it plays fine on the new Echo but it just does not seem to take commands very well.  The spanish commands are hit and miss but right on with the echo show.Overall I am very disappointed with the replacement.  If it wasn't for my smart home features I may even consider sending it back till they can get it right.  The first and second gen plus is still very cheap and I could just replace it with that from ebay or something.(update)  So tech support reached out to me and was concerned as well.  It seems that my Echo Show is less sensitive to commands than the echo plus.  The echo plus being more sensitive, would not know how to respond if there was an extra word in the command.  As for the Language issue well it worked fine the first time the tech was listening but the second time it would not respond saying it had a limited vocab.  They will work on it.  Because they were so nice about it I told them I would update my original review to include their exceptional service.	3	June 12, 2021	1
82	Echo 4th Gen	Bought for an improvement in sound over my echo dot, but the sound is not that much better.  Voice recognition is better, but the improvement does not justify the additional cost.	3	August 15, 2022	1
83	Echo 4th Gen	"Okay, so I have had an Echo 1st Gen with hub for about three years now.  I also have purchased several Echo Dots in that time.  I like how each sounds but I have to admit the Echo 1st Gen with hub sounds great, much better than the Dots.  I didn't and don't have a problem with it, it still sounds great and responds great.  It sounds so great I had been planning on getting a second one to go in another room for some time.  So since I kept seeing the new 4th Gen Echo advertised for around $70 I couldn't pass it up.  I read the reviews about having to repeat ""Alexa"" being an issue but I didn't realize how bad it would be until I ran into the problem myself.  I have it in my bedroom on my nightstand and you would think that no matter what position you are in it would hear you when you are lying on the bed with the speaker about a foot away.  But that's not the case, if you are facing away from the speaker you almost have to yell ""Alexa"", so that your sound bounces off one of the walls, to get a response.  And this is the case no matter where you are in the room.  You have to face the speaker to get a constant response.  I don't have that problem with the 1st Gen speaker.  If it only had only happened a couple of times I wouldn't care, but it's constant.But not all is bad about the speaker.  I know that some of the reviews mentioned about it's tone being a little too low.  I actually like the sound it puts out.  This is far better than my 1st Gen and the Dots.  After all the ranting about having to repeat my demands, the sound, at least for me, does make up for it and I do plan on buying another one to get a more stereo effect.I still don't think that it warrants four or five stars because it is a smart speaker, and if previous generations function better at performing that function, there is definitely room for improvement for this gen."	3	December 19, 2020	1
84	Echo 4th Gen	Good addition to our home for playing music. Much better sound quality than standard echo models...but not equal to other equally priced speakers. We bought at 1/2 off and at that price is a very good quality speaker. At this price, however,  should include integrated battery rather than add-on at additional cost.	3	July 30, 2022	1
85	Echo 4th Gen	If you like echo's this is nice EXCEPT the CHARCOAL model comes with an ULTRA WHITE power supply and cable.  The cable sticks out like a sore thumb, I just cannot walk by this with out seeing that ULTRA WHITE cable and being annoyed.  I might as well just tossed white extrension cables all over the house.It is so annoying that this will probably end up in the basement or the garage where I won't be judged when guests to my home see it.	3	July 7, 2022	1
86	Echo 4th Gen	I've had it for over a year and it seems I have to repeat myself more and more .	3	August 27, 2022	1
87	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa kept disconnecting from the internet. Then she stopped working overall. It hasn’t even been a year. She’s not recognizing my sound anymore.	3	August 24, 2022	1
88	Echo 4th Gen	I loved (past tense) having echos at home so this unit as an echo gets 4 stars but as a smart home hub it fails miserable and gets 1 star.I bought this unit to control smart devices at my office. At home I use smart things with echo dots all over and it works great when our echos aren’t deaf or, now suddenly, trying to advertise crap after being given a conmand (if you’re reading this Amazon I’m about to rip every Amazon device out because of that bs).At my office though I just needed a small amount of devices to control and make a few automations with and I thought this would kill 2 birds with one stone. Man was I wrong.My first complaint is everything after two days shows up as unresponsive. It still works with voice commands or in the app but you constantly have the darn thing chiming back at you to say “table warmer is unavailable please check the Alexa app or this device is offline please check the Alexa app for further information” and you can’t make it stop. Considering I’m using it in my massage studio this is beyond annoying when it blurts that out while Al client is already on the table.Routines suck too. You cannot use more than one sensor in a routine.  I wanted it to do certain things like it the door sensor opens and you detect motion turn on this this and this. No.  You can only use one either the door or the motion but not both. This hub has been out for 5 years how is it still this basic?Want to see the history of your sensors? Tough s***. You cannot see a log (at least I cannot find where and I’ve looked) of the sensor.  Did someone come into my office when I wasn’t there? Who the heck knows because I can’t see the log.  The guard thing is annoying. I just wanted what I thought was basic smart home stuff. What I got was the kindergarten version of a smart home hub.Amazon you are FAILING miserably between the Alexa advertisements and interruptions and the smart home hub. Like I mentioned earlier I’m about to rip every Amazon assistant from my home and find something better if they don’t fix it. If I ask for the weather that’s all I want. I don’t want you rambling on about a new skill I can buy or something else you can do. Just do what is ask and stop. But no it’s all about money.I used to love these things now I just find myself yelling at them because they go deaf and can’t turn on a simple light or telling it to shut up because it goes off the rails.  I have one dot in the living room that can hear EVERYTHING, I have the same versions in each room and that one dot almost never misses a beat when I ask it to do something even in other rooms. The others I can be standing two feet from and it can’t hear a truck plowing through the house to save it. In total I have 6 new dots at home and this 1 plus at work.  Thinking of just getting the home pods and being done with Amazon altogether.	1	March 1, 2022	0
89	Echo 4th Gen	No suena tan alto como promocionan, el volumen no es muy alto  y tiene muy pocos  bajos .  Grabé error.	3	August 18, 2022	1
90	Echo 4th Gen	Overall works well with certain Alexa commands. However quite often does not respond correctly to a question or command. This one is pretty stubborn, sometimes even ignores us.	3	August 13, 2022	1
91	Echo 4th Gen	Love the new features, and loved the new sound quality. However, I had to repeat myself or yell to get echo to hear me or recognize the commands. Much more so than the Gen 2 I was using previously.Since this is a work environment, and we use echo for timing - had to reinstall the Gen 2 for now.	3	July 22, 2022	1
92	Echo 4th Gen	I find myself having to repeat myself approximately 50% of the time when asking a question and the speaker quality needs more base	3	August 17, 2022	1
93	Echo 4th Gen	My Alexa could not do the things it was supposed to do. Upon investigation with an Amazon representative it was discovered that my Alexa had been registered to somebody else therefore it could not link up to my different devices properly. It is my belief that this Alexa was someone else’s Amazon return that got sent to me	3	July 22, 2022	1
94	Echo 4th Gen	The device arrived only three days ago, so I don’t have much experience or basis on which to evaluate it. It sounds good. Alexa plays stuff via other apps, so that part seems good. I’m still playing with it. (And I dislike how Amazon wants a review as soon as it’s just out of the box.)	3	July 24, 2022	1
95	Echo 4th Gen	Doesn’t respond to hey Alexa, have to stand up close and speak Loudly.Only responding less than 45%..Disappointed, dissatisfied.Advertised as much better product.IT IS NOT !!!	3	August 8, 2022	1
96	Echo 4th Gen	Update:  I rated this 4 stars, but I'm changing it to 3 for now.  I have become increasingly frustrated with it's inability to hear me.  Sometimes I have to yell so loud that the bedroom Echo responds instead of the one in the family room.  I'm seriously considering returning this one and using my old gen 1 Echo.  Either Amazon needs to improve the sensitivity or give us the ability to adjust it ourselves.I bought this to replace a gen 1 tower.  I have several echo devices around the house and liked the old cylinder.  I won’t comment on the aesthetics since that is a personal preference, but will say the new design requires a larger footprint on the table.  The base is small, but the diameter of the sphere means you can’t put anything close to the bottom of the base.  Functionally, the sound quality is much better than the gen 1 device.  I appreciate that the new design probably was necessary for that.  The new echo is much more directional.  This is good if you have it against a wall, but not if it is in the middle of the room.  The light ring at the base makes it difficult to see on a low table or if there is something on the table next to it (like a book).  I have a lot of trouble seeing if Alexa heard me.  Speaking of that...it seems Alexa is aging and has a lot more trouble hearing me than the old one did.  I find I have to talk loudly to be heard and with the light ring at the bottom, I have to be in the right position to see if she’s responding.  The built in hub was a bonus.  I have a hub from years ago, so have not made use of it yet, but will eventually try to retire the hub I have.  I like the new device, but will not be replacing any of my gen 3 dots with the new dots.  I wish they still sold the gen 3s with the clock.  I’ll wait for the next revision and see how I feel about those.	3	November 23, 2020	1
97	Echo 4th Gen	I got this using Amazon Trade-In program because the gen 1 I had was a bit funky when trying to get it to listen to commands.  So I figured that the gen 4 would be a bit better by now.  Nope, same issues.  Oh well.  At least it is a upgraded product for free.	3	July 21, 2022	1
98	Echo 4th Gen	Like overall. Keeps loosing the internet where the micro doesn't and it is further from source	3	August 27, 2022	1
99	Echo 4th Gen	Buttons are kinda pointless. No need for one to mute and one to unmute. Also alexa can control volume through voice control… a button to stop the music instantly may have been helpful. I love the communication feature I can send messages to home to verbally announce or display on my firetv.	3	July 23, 2022	1
100	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this because of the temperature sensor.The first one I received was constantly reading wrong by a few degrees, but was inconsistent - sometimes it was correct, sometimes it was high by as many as 6 degrees Fahrenheit, sometimes it was low by a degree or two.  I know this both by the feel of the room temperature and because I placed a digital thermometer six inches from the device.  Because of this inconsistency, I couldn't even just manually include an offset for my purposes (a window AC unit plugged into an IoT plug with automations to turn it on/off based on the temperature reading off the sensor).Thinking the first one was just a defective unit, I was sent a replacement... which has the exact same issue.  Clearly the sensor in this generation is just flawed and therefore should not be purchased if you plan to use the temperature readings for anything other than a very rough estimate.Everything else about the device works as-expected and it is a very cool looking unit.If I hadn't bought this specifically for the temperature sensor, I'd probably have given it four stars.  Will update this review if the readings are fixed via software update (although I image they are due to hardware issues).	2	July 26, 2022	0

102	Echo 4th Gen	Use it primarily for music. Does not always retain my songs and plays music without input from me on what songs I like.	3	August 15, 2022	1
103	Echo 4th Gen	Works great and really loud	3	September 7, 2022	1
104	Echo 4th Gen	I have more problems with the mic on this generation than older ones	3	August 28, 2022	1
105	Echo 4th Gen	I like the New look and so far it works as expected. Very Happy with the Sound Quality,  so I ordered a few of the other models to compliment the sound in my living room.	3	July 29, 2022	1
106	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is disappointing. Hard to understand words and background music louder than vocal.	3	August 18, 2022	1
107	Echo 4th Gen	* AUDIO:  the audio coming out of this Echo is very heavy on the bass and sounds are muddled.  Not crisp, clean, clear.* BUILT-IN ZIGBEE HUB:  after unplugging the Echo (or after a power outage) Zigbee devices get disconnected and do not automatically reconnect.  It is a huge pain to have to reset and reconnect each device and redo any routines that used those devices.  I also worry about the safety and security of a smart home when devices like heaters, humidifiers, alarms, etc no longer talk to the hub or follow automated commands after after a power outage.  Hopefully this is something that Amazon can fix with a Echo software update.* TEMP SENSOR: I like that there is a temperature sensor, but unlike a standalone Zigbee temperature sensor, the temperature reading from the Echo doesn't show up when I add the Echo to the Favorites section of the Devices page in the Alexa app.  It should.  Seems fixable with an Alexa app update.* FORM FACTOR:  The spherical shape may work for smaller Echo Dots, but in the larger Echo it is not appealing.  In my room it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Reminds me of those big red bollards in front of Target stores.	3	December 14, 2021	1
108	Echo 4th Gen	During Prime Day 2021 I finally decided to upgrade all my echo devices. I was still rocking the gen 1 pringles can Alexa and hockey puck echo dots.Back in the day I heard about how the echo plus and then the 3rd gen still didn’t sound nearly as level or bassy as the first generation echo so I had been abstaining from upgrading for a while. But then the quality of the sound from the 4th gen had been one of the main features I had been hearing about so I finally decided it was time. And honestly on that front as well as the built in zigbee hub it delivers in spades. The 4th gen Echo is more than capable of shaking the entire bookshelf she’s on with just the default audio settings.However, there is one extremely frustrating aspect to the 4th gen echo, coming from a 1st gen: microphone quality and her ability to recognize when she is being spoken to.My 1st gen echo was almost too sensitive. She would wake up for anything that even vaguely sounded like “Alexa” at any volume with close to any amount of room noise. I have an oscillating fan in my living room and she could hear me over that and the TV. The new 4th gen will basically refuse to hear me unless I turn the fan off and mute the TV. And when she does recognize that I’m yelling ALEXA at her from 10 feet away, half the time she won’t pick up on the command I speak next. I bought a new echo dot the same day as the full size echo and she has no such problems. I honestly wish I had bought two dots except for the fact that the audio quality on the echo is outstanding.	3	July 13, 2021	1
109	Echo 4th Gen	"Firstly, I'm fully ""in"" when it comes to Amazon products. My smart home uses Alexa as a hub, fireTV products throughout, tablets, switches, plugs etc etc and not to mention various versions of Amazon Echo.With that being said I know not to expect the best of the best with anything Amazon puts out. They aren't making the top of the line product and that's perfectly fine for me.This Echo however missed the mark for me on two very important aspects sound & voice recognition. Music through this Echo is simply muffled and without substance. Yes, I've played with placement and EQ settings. It just isn't what it should be. The volume output is strong and the bass as well. There however is pitiful mid/treble range on this thing. I'd even go as far as saying my 2nd gen echo dot puts out a fuller sound than this Echo does.Additionally, the voice recognition on this system just isn't as good. I'm not sure why that is but again my earlier generation echo dots I have are more alert to my voice commands.Overall I'm disappointed. I'm no audiophile but I definitely notice the lack of quality in this speaker."	3	January 13, 2022	1
110	Echo 4th Gen	I actually prefer the more balanced sound from my echo plus (2nd gen) without needing to mess with the equalizer. I also prefer the 360° sound from the echo plus. after going back-and-forth I’ve personally experienced the microphones on the echo plus pick up my voice better. in my opinion this new version just sounds a little bit louder with more bass even though they both have the exact same drivers with the exception of the new one having an extra tweeter which doesn’t really make a difference in the sound. I actually had to turn down the bass just a little because it sounded a little... messy. i’m not really sure why they completely changed the design and got rid of the 360° sound and made it a directional sound speaker instead. i’m a little confused. One more thing I noticed about the new speaker is when the volume goes up the bass goes down which is very common for all these speakers and most Bluetooth speakers but it seems especially evident in this newest version of the echo. they could’ve at least made the bluetooth option volume sync with your phone with this new version. and of course it wasn’t compatible to pair with my echo plus for stereo. ok i’m done.	2	October 23, 2020	0
111	Echo 4th Gen	It doesn't work as well or at all compared to all the previous models.	3	August 16, 2022	1
112	Echo 4th Gen	Updated 3x: this device works for a while then will randomly stop listening to you and you need to manually restart them to get it to listen to you. This makes it feel more like a diy tinkering toy and less like a premium product.My device still plays music from routines so I know it is connected to the internet so this is just an Amazon issue. Very disappointing. I wish I had stuck with google or tried apple’s offering instead.Another issue I’ve found, this device consistently asks me if I want to hear about products. I want my smart home device to control my smart home, not shove marketing down my throat.Updated 2x: the device has not given me any more issues. The mic is so sensitive it hears commands coming from downstairs or even when I whisper the A word. The sound quality is muddy but becomes “normal” when you turn down the bass setting as low as possible. This makes the device sound very good. This is a great upgrade over a dot to the point where I actually enjoy listening to music on it.If you want an alexa device and don’t want to spend $200 for the studio this is the one to get.I only wish they added that light up clock on this one, then It would be perfect for me.Updated: last time I unplugged and plugged back in this device seemed to do the trick fixing the microphone sensitivity for the last week.We will see how long it lasts before I need to do this againI needed to upgrade because the echo 1 I was using had an issue where the speaker would short out so you had to unplug it and plug it back in to get the sound to work.In terms of sound and voice recognition this device is not a huge upgrade compared to the first gen echo.This device is just as good as the original with some added features like a thermometer and sonic detection and a 3.5mm out/in so you can use it as a speaker or use other speakers with it.Why this device gets 1 star is for some reason when the device has been plugged in for awhile it will stop hearing the wake word. I am unsure if it is a power saving setting or a wifi setting but the device just does not listen. The only way to fix it is to unplug and plug the device back in.This was the main reason I needed a new device in the first place so you can see how satisfied I am with the new echo.Will update the review if they fix it, until then I’ll keep using my google home mini instead	1	April 29, 2022	0
113	Echo 4th Gen	Es bueno pero por 90 dolares creo q podrian mejorar el sonido, microfonos y el zigbee para que tenga mejor alcance	3	August 10, 2022	1
114	Echo 4th Gen	Super annoying to have to screen at it to hear me when my previous echo had no problem.	3	August 12, 2022	1
115	Echo 4th Gen	I bought a refurb. Not much different than the one we had. Much better bass for music. I don’t notice the voice recognition being any better.	3	August 1, 2022	1

117	Echo 4th Gen	Purchased to replace the gen 1 white Echo cylinder that had its WiFi circuit fail after 4 years of daily use.Arrived and setup was easy and it did all the cylinder did , slightly  better sound as well (though fabric cover is not suited for kitchens - so amazon being back a cylinder variant as well , Of hard plastic so it can be cleaned on the outsides with a glass cleaner ).But today - day 5 of use out of the blue the music playing suddenly emitter a loud crackle sound of 1-2 seconds length. Went to investigate the noise. Again the loud crackle and then the music returned. Waited a bit and again. It was happening regularly , about 3 to 4 times a minute.  Unplugged and replugged to see if a reboot would help.  Sitting idle nothing. Asked Alexa to play music and it began playing - and again every 15-20 seconds the loud crackle if 1-2 second length.  Definite hardware failure.By the nature of it I suspect the circuits that feed the digital audio from that source in the cpu over to the digital to analog converter before it goes to the amp , is getting  the data corrupted and so what gets decode isn’t the music signal not now a random jumble of loud digital noise. Packet corruption if you will.So fails on less than a week - a computer or build flaw. Back it goes. Given others habe reported this of may be a bigger batch or systemic failure of some bad components or issue with the board design that fails after some days of use.So if you are buying one in 2022 be sure to plug it in and make use of it playing music daily for at least a few weeks so you can get a refund / exchange more easily.  Don’t leave it in the box for weeks or give it as a gift some days / weeks down the road.	1	August 21, 2022	0
118	Echo 4th Gen	"This is a super handy device, but it has some reliability issues that make it iffy for the kind of lifestyle integration it seems like it'd help with. Voice recognition is a 50/50 toss-up, and while it's better at accurately recognizing words and phrases than other AI assistants, it still misses enough that important information doesn't get added to your to-do list or shopping list.I use it the most for timers, calendar reminders, task reminders, and adding things to my to-do list and shopping list hands off. Timers and task reminders work great; calendar reminders are awesome, but for some reason everything gets repeated twice even after having it set in the app to only repeat reminders once. The to-do list and shopping list feature works, but the integrations between different apps are really poor (my to-do list lets me have a dumping ground list for tasks added through the Alexa, but I have to manually sort and tag them later), and the Alexa app's features aren't strong enough that I'd be comfortable switching my lists to its platform for the ease of integration.We have two smart lights from Geeni that we use with it, and every second or third time we try to operate them through voice commands, the command fails in some way - the Echo doesn't respond even after listening to your request, or it says ""okay"" but doesn't actually operate the light until a few minutes or few tries later.We tried connecting it to our Firestick, but it was so non-functional we had a better experience just keeping them separate. HBO would routinely crash, or the sound would cut off of HBO streams, when the Echo was the speaker for the firestick; and the process of re-connecting the Echo after this happens, and clearing the Firestick app cache and relaunching things, etc. made the process miserable and unworkable.The app is very slow and hard to navigate - the paths to different features are hard to find, and you have to retrace your steps a lot to complete multiple complex actions.The audio quality is excellent, and I love using it for sleep ambience and music. However, it's very annoying to have to hear ads interfering with the experience of virtually any Alexa app you'll use, whether that's a small soundscape service or a major music platform. The best experience I have is connecting it to my phone via Bluetooth so I can play whatever I want without interruption, which is a pain, but at least then I haven't just paid for an Amazon product that still makes me listen to ads.Also, the fact that staff will have to listen to voice recordings to improve the quality of the products or that your speech is stored in the cloud at all is a huge privacy issue."	2	July 22, 2021	0
119	Echo 4th Gen	Sound is good. Speaker groups, one of the main reasons I got it, are completely unreliable, no matter how I configure them.	3	August 6, 2022	1
120	Echo 4th Gen	Bought this for 2 primary reasons:1st - audio, which is quite good for the size especially the bass, and FYI this is much larger than the previous round one.2nd - the built in temperature sensor, which turns out to be practically useless. I had pretty much no luck, even with support help, getting any Alexa Routines to utilize the built in temperature sensor, even though is recognized the sensor while creating the Routine. It also seems to go in to calibration mode often, and if you ask it the inside temperature it often tells you it’s calibrating ask later.I purchased an inexpensive stand alone temperature and humidity sensor and it works flawlessly with the Smart Life app to control a smart plug according to specific temperature conditions. I had no luck getting the Smart Life app to recognize the Echo temperature sensor at all, which may or may not be normal.As others state the voice recognition could be better, especially when playing music.	3	March 1, 2022	1
121	Echo 4th Gen	They made it seem like it was good but really all I here is treble and no bass whatsoever. It's not that loud as u think either I wouldn't buy one if I were you.	3	July 19, 2022	1
122	Echo 4th Gen	It would have been nice to know this unit is not compatible with any Amazon remote controls before I purchased it.	3	July 31, 2022	1
123	Echo 4th Gen	Love it. If and when it works!!🤷🏼‍♂️😬🥹🥹🥹	3	August 15, 2022	1
124	Echo 4th Gen	So I got this on prime day and the deal price is just about the same. What a waste of stress time thinking I had to buy it before it ended.	3	July 18, 2022	1
125	Echo 4th Gen	Works as expected. Sound is good. Music and many other functions require additional links or products for additional costs.  Other than music. Have no other use for it.	3	July 19, 2022	1
126	Echo 4th Gen	This is the worst purchase I ever made. Was having difficulty with my gen 1 and gen 2 Echo with hub. The gen 1 had no hub but worked the gen 2 had difficulty with recognizing speech and the sound was a bit tinny so I wanted an upgrade and got the gen 4 echo with 2 dot combo. The speech recognition is almost non existent the sound quality is muffled like if you covered it with a towel. We have to scream at the echo to get it to respond and 9 times out of 10 the old gen 2 will respond from 3 rooms away while the new gen 4, 1 foot away does nothing. We set it up between our recliners in the living room on a stand that is clear of obstacles and put the echo at head height when we are seated. I don't know how we could possibly make the conditions any better for the device to hear us. We were also sold a used unit without our knowledge or consent. It was still registered and paired with the previous owner from Rochester NY, and still had a unique name assigned to it from said owner. It's bad enough I'm buying Chinese junk that spies on me but I would never buy USED Chinese junk with the previous owners returned problems still attached to it.	2	June 7, 2022	0
127	Echo 4th Gen	We ordered the charcoal color which is very nice EXCEPT they shipped it with a white power cord.  I almost returned because the cord sticks out like a sore thumb.  No attention to detail in product development.	3	July 13, 2022	1
128	Echo 4th Gen	I was expecting a much richer sound but it does get loud	3	August 9, 2022	1
129	Echo 4th Gen	Not sure why this Echo product is hard of hearing but it is. I have an older dot thirty feet away in the bathroom that responds more than this one in a very central location of my living room + kitchen.Also, the issue with Amazon devices playing Amazon music for three songs then stopping has not been addressed for years, I even pay more for the unlimited music sub.Other than constantly yelling to get this to hear me and playing three songs….Shrugs.I expected more for what I paid for this.	3	June 6, 2022	1
130	Echo 4th Gen	I like the idea of speaking instead of having to go to App to change what music I want to listen to!	3	July 27, 2022	1
131	Echo 4th Gen	"Do not buy this if you are using it with Apple Music. I'm confident it's a piece of garbage for Spotify users too. Echo is advertised to work with Apple Music. But you can only use Apple Music in specific ways.You cannot access your library! The only way to access songs in your library is by creating your own playlist. And that still does not give you access to a play a song in that playlist. You have to skip through the playlist to find the desired song. It doesn't let you play Recently Played or Recently Added either.You cannot tell Echo to play a song or an album you want to listen to! You cannot select songs or albums on your phone either. The app is bad in other ways. I wish I could just connect to bluetooth and use the Apple Music or Spotify app on my phone (like any other bluetooth speaker).DELAY is very long when using the app! Earlier today I pressed the skip button on my phone to change songs. I was able to have a short conversation with someone before the command was processed (or the song actually changed). No exaggeration. Usually the delay is shorter, but still about 5 seconds. That's still unacceptable and frustrating. You cannot skip songs without wasting lots of time.You can only tell Alexa to start the playlist, shuffle, and skip songs (waiting several seconds or sometimes minutes between songs).Volume buttons on my iPhone do not work while using Echo. I have to scroll the volume tab on the app, or use my voice to tell Alexa to quiet down. And, like switching songs, there is a LONG DELAY when you adjust volume! I found myself accidentally playing music way too loud and having to just deal with the pain and discomfort for several seconds. You cannot quickly adjust the volume!I have not been this disappointed and frustrated with a product. I am convinced this is Amazon's way of making people switch from Apple Music or Spotify to their music service. It probably works well with their streaming service. That must be why Echo is priced reasonably.Sound quality is ok for the price. It's louder than I expected. However, bass heavy music like Rap sounds distorted and generally poor. It is advertised as having ""deep bass."" Bass is really disappointing with this, even considering it's a small and affordable speaker. My smaller, lighter, wireless JBL speaker has more bass. The Echo gets much louder (with no bass).Alexa is sometimes bad at understanding commands. I said earlier, ""Alexa, play Recently Played playlist on Apple Music."" (I know this command cannot be done with the Echo.) However, instead of telling me this cannot be done, Alexa played some Apple Curated playlist that had nothing to do with my command. Music played that I don't like and I could not pause it for 5-10 seconds.All that being said, you'll be disappointed with this product. Disappointed is not a strong enough word through. This thing is intentionally designed by Amazon to frustrate people that use Apple Music and Spotify. I understand that Amazon is motivated by profit. However, profit should not come at the expense of making customers angry. This Echo was clearly built to make people so frustrated, so they switch to Amazon's music service. The majority of people use Apple Music and Spotify. They intentionally prohibit the most BASIC features so that you pay them instead of Apple or Spotify! I feel disrespected by Amazon."	1	December 26, 2020	0
132	Echo 4th Gen	Standard alexa, seems OK for most part. Big issue though, I ordered a BLACK Alexa and received one, but the cord and plug are white. So, if you are planning on trying to make this blend into an environment, it really will not.	3	July 8, 2022	1
133	Echo 4th Gen	It's OK for speech; and it'll god a basic job of playing music -- but the sound-quality is mediocre.	3	July 31, 2022	1
134	Echo 4th Gen	it's a good product sometimes it acts up in ways but overall i love the product and i think is great for a bedroom which is where mine is for music to get ready to and stuff becuase they speak we of it is actually not bad	3	July 4, 2022	1
135	Echo 4th Gen	See headline.	3	August 15, 2022	1
136	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa has been a real pain in the butt. I primarily use it for playing music, and many times it won't recognize what I request even when I say it over and over again. It always defaults to Amazon music or a radio station I never heard of.  Yesterday I asked it to play music from Bridgerton and it couldn't find it. ?????? I had to direct it to Spotify and that took 5 different tries.  When it finally did, I couldn't get it to change to another music type.  I told it to play classical music and it started the Bridgerton series. I find this device highly annoying and not that good.	3	May 18, 2022	1
137	Echo 4th Gen	This little sphere is pretty dumb.  If I say lunch, she hears launch, setting reminders is interesting, what we say and what she announces is like auto correct gone bad.  All in all, we’re going to put the old one back in the main living area and relegate the sphere to a bedroom or basement.  She’s essentially worthless.	3	June 23, 2022	1
138	Echo 4th Gen	"If you just need someone to talk to, the Echo is perfect for you. If you want a device that will actually do what it is supposed to without randomly just forgetting how to do things it was doing literally minutes before, don't waste your money on an Echo.I purchased the Echo to act as a room thermometer since I live in a state that does not feel that central heat and air is worth providing to peasants in apartments. Worked great out of the box, so I got a bunch of the light bulbs to go with it expecting that I was about to start setting up my smart home for the future. Within a few days most of the light blubs no longer responded to voice commands, or did respond but Alexa would tell me that it is not responding. Annoying, but as it was not the thing I bought this for, it was simply an annoyance.Then the thermometer stopped working. Rather than tell me there is an issue, or provide any semblance of help, Alexa just says this feature is not supported. Well, that of course is simply not correct, but Alexa will not help you with things, she simply is a robot voice with no ability to problem solve or even perform the most basic error checking that even Windows is finally good at. So there is no arguing with her, when she says it is not supported, boom, it simply does not work anymore.So I went through the hassle of trying to figure out how to get it working again. Finally found that by removing all of the groups and lights I had added and then reset the device, the one thing I bought it for will actually work again. Great! I cant use any of the other features it has or it will kill the thermometer, but hey $50 for a thermometer is a steal. Wait... indoor thermometers are way cheaper than that. Well shoot.I then got home this evening to find that even though I have none of the other features activated, the thermometer is again ""not supported"". I work in tech support so I understand that things will not always work right out of the box, and that is reasonable. For them to randomly break with no input from the user is just a sign of a poorly made and designed product. Honestly, Bezos has all of the money now so trying to provide feedback to Amazon at this point is useless. If you have never gotten to experience their customer service, try it sometime. It is eye opening. So rather than write them a long message they will never read, it is easier to just let all of yall know what to expect.It might work, it might not, but if it doesn't you are up the proverbial creek without a paddle. Quite honestly mine is a paperweight right now. At least it cant mess that up. Not happy, 0/10 would not recommend."	1	February 9, 2022	0
139	Echo 4th Gen	I've compared my new Eco's sound quality with my older Eco Dot, but could not find a difference. I don't think  that it justify's x3 price...	3	July 17, 2022	1
140	Echo 4th Gen	"I feel like I'm a fanboy of Alexa. I have Echo dot 4th gen, Echo 4th gen and Echo Plus and I love the capabilities of this smart device and the sound quality.Yesterday though, I tried pairing all of the devices so they will play together, and after trying so many different things, I got 2 devices to work, but the Echo dot just can't connect to the other 2. Not as ""Alexa play everywhere"", and not by adding it to the group in the app.Alexa also acts strangely when she doesn't understand something and just bleeps something and shuts off. If I ask a long question, she'll cut me and start operating based on half of my sentence.She never was able to answer something that is relevant to the previous thing we talked about. For example: ""Alexa, what is the tallest building"" and she would tell me ""Burj Khalifa"", I'd ask ""And what is its height"" and she wouldn't know what is ""it"", she doesn't know we just spoke about the Burj Khalifa.The thing is that its been so many years already and it seems like there is no progress in her abilities and sometimes it's seems like she gotten worse through the years.I used to be able to play ""My sleep playlist from spotify"" but now she will always look for playlists made by Spotify instead of playing the playlists I created. Even if I'll name the playlist ""sleep by me"" or some other more specific name of a playlist that isn't public on Spotify, she'll say ""Sorry , I don't know a playlist called ""Sleep by me"" even though that is exactly the name, and she's connected to my Spotify user."	1	September 6, 2022	0
141	Echo 4th Gen	"Cons: it cannot Cast audio from my phone, does not work with Spotify app, Alexa app is incomprehensible, it shouts ""Now commented to XYZ!"" every time it connects to a device, it keeps flashing colors all day and night with no clear way to stop it, and setting up home theater pairing is bizarrely overcomplicated in the app.Pros: It pairs with the Fire Stick for a home theater setup and works perfectly. Alexa voice recognition is great. Audio quality is great."	2	October 25, 2022	0
142	Echo 4th Gen	"The device voice recognition is very good and it helps with automations around the house.As an external speaker, the story is different.Connecting via Bluetooth: Sound quality is OK for a device this size; this was expected. The annoying ""feature"" is that it screams announcing ""PLAYING FROM JOHN's DESKTOP"", and this happens in the middle of meetings. So I decided to use it with a 3.5mm audio cable.3.5mm audio cable: The Echo has a terrible hissing noise. It is not a ground loop, it is not the cable, it is not the audio source. I just took another speaker that I have and there is zero hissing connecting it to the same power outlet, same audio source, and same 3.5 audio cable.So if you want to use the Echo as an external speaker for your laptop or cellphone, look for another device; this is not the one."	3	March 11, 2022	1
143	Echo 4th Gen	"The Pros: It's more compact, and has a nice aesthetic look.  The sound seems a bit better than the 1st Gen, although I don't use it often for music.  It integrates flawlessly into the Alexa environment.The Cons: This is a biggie: after giving it a command, it will NOT respond to a second command right away.  It appears to need a few seconds to ""recycle."" I don't know if this is endemic to ALL Gen 4 Echos, or if it is just an issue w/ mine.  This is NOT the case with the 1st Gen Echo I had, or even the 4th Gen Dots, I have.  Had I known this beforehand, it would have been a deal killer, and I'd have simply ordered another Dot, instead."	3	April 18, 2022	1
144	Echo 4th Gen	I bought three of these around the release and have regretted the purchase. We have a total of 12 Echos, Echo Shows, & Echo Dots placed throughout our home and these are the worst when it comes to communication. 2 of them replaced Echo 3rd Gens, and another was an add on to an existing TV (with 4k firestick) for better sound and since adding them to our system, we have had nothing but problems with the wrong device answering us. None of the locations changed, these were just swapped in. We noticed that these ALL LAG, and must not have the same speaker configuration as the Echo 3rd Gens because Echos two rooms away will now answer before these devices will.They do sound GREAT when they work properly, but because we already had a functioning system throughout our house, and knew the capabilities, these were/are a HUGE let down.I have tried updating them to see if that helps, but it has not.As a stand alone device these might be great, but to a family that has been using Alexas since the beginning and keeps adding for functionality around the home, we find them more of a nuisance than a help. We end up yelling at poor Alexa more than it's worth.I will note also, one is being used and is hard wired into my work from home computer, and that one lags even more... I notice when I unplug the AUX cable it seems to pick up speed, but when it is plugged in via the AUX cable to my PC it lags and is very slow to respond which in turn has the wrong device answering most times.It has all become more frustrating than helpful. Hoping that an update can help solve this matter in the future.	3	March 16, 2021	1
145	Echo 4th Gen	Wasn’t the premium sound I’d expected at all	3	August 5, 2022	1
146	Echo 4th Gen	I was surprised by how little this thing can actually do and by how un-seamless the user experience is. The biggest smart-home items I have that I wanted to connect are my robot vacuum and robot mopper, from Neato and iRobot respectively.The Alexa app has robot vacuums as a main device category, but connecting them is really difficult. For the Neato vacuum, you have to connect your Neato account to Amazon. Fair enough, except that it only works if you used the same email address for both accounts! You will have to change your Neato email address to whatever you use with Amazon. Sorry if you wanted privacy.Connecting the iRobot mopper just didn't work. You have to install the iRobot skill, then add the bot as a device, but it won't connect to my Braava Jet robot at all. There is really no way to get help with it either. Amazon can't offer support for the dozens of 3rd party devices they claim to support, and iRobot doesn't know how to get it to work either. That is a hint of a failing ecosystem.I don't have any smart lights or anything like that yet, so what's left in terms of functionality is low-level features like the flash briefing. But even this seems like it's been neglected by Amazon. Many of the news sources on offer have stopped updating, so you can add them but Alexa just says they are unavailable every time. It's really difficult to customize also. I noticed if you ask Alexa how to edit your flash briefing she gives you inaccurate directions that don't reflect the current version of the Alexa app. If you manage to figure it out, you realize you can't really add useful things to your flash briefing like air quality for your city. It seems the boundaries of the experience are quite narrow, and they are becoming more narrow as the ecosystem shrinks. This is supposed to be a flagship device for Amazon and a key part of their strategy, but the experience has atrophied badly.	1	July 20, 2022	0
147	Echo 4th Gen	"My original 1st Gen Alexa finally died after nearly 8 years. So traded in for this Echo 4th Gen. It is more expensive than the dots and supposedly better sound quality. But don't believe it; mine sucks. Sound is poor and muffled. When it plays music, music can barely be heard. When Echo is speaking, it is LOUD. Also, voice-recognition sucks. ""Alexa, what is the weather today?"" Alexa: ""It is 7:04pm now."" And that is when it actually hears me (I have to SHOUT). After four generations, Amazon devices have gotten worse, not better. If you have to buy, stick with the dots."	2	October 5, 2022	0
148	Echo 4th Gen	Voice recognition doesn’t appear to be as good as previous generations. I’m always having to repeat myself. Pretty good otherwise.	3	July 23, 2022	1
149	Echo 4th Gen	Nice device with pretty light band at base. Fits easily everywhere. Purchased this in order to hear music when I’m home doing things around the house, like cooking. I asked Alexa which device had the best sound quality for music and she said this one! However, a friend gave a different device to my aunt that sounds much better and I will probably buy that next. Don’t know what it is. It’s round and cylindrical, and tall. Great, balanced sound with every song I’ve ever requested from Alexa. Going to pick it out now!! It’s sounds great in the open area of our cottage in VT. Love that one! This one is good, step above the Echo Show I have for music sound. But it’s still not nearly as clear or balanced as the one I can’t name!! Sorry!	3	March 30, 2022	1
150	Echo 4th Gen	It sounds just like all of the other Alexa’s	3	August 5, 2022	1
151	Echo 4th Gen	Like many other reviews, the microphone on this device is inferior to other Alexa devices. I have a basic echo and a flex device in nearby rooms, and even when I am 10 to 15 ft away from this one, the other devices will often hear me instead of this one.	3	June 26, 2022	1
152	Echo 4th Gen	This is my 12th echo in the house. Every one i have that is black came with a black cord. This one came with a white cord. It is clearly for a black area, smh.	3	July 5, 2022	1
153	Echo 4th Gen	"20220508. This is an Alexa device, but it seems to have trouble recognizing when you are talking to it. I've found I have to pause after saying Alexa before I add the instruction. Even then, it often takes 4 or 5 tries to get the blue ring to light up. This behavior is consistent with both of these Echos, and with the larger version (I bought the three pack).I don't know what Amazon is doing under the covers, but I will say I've noticed a general degrading in voice recognition on other Echos, especially on the Echo Show. My guess is they have been dorking with the OS and have added too many ""features"" so that the CPU is overwhelmed and not as responsive as it once was.For example, I am now queried on a regular basis to give a rating to products I bought, and reminded that consumables I've purchased in the past might be running out. I don't need that stuff, and I would far prefer to have an Echo that is responsive and less of an ad machine for Amazon.20220511. UPDATE. Amazon called me with some suggestions for improving the response. I've made the adjustments. I will update when I've had time to see if it makes a difference. I am adding one star for Amazon following up."	2	May 8, 2022	0
154	Echo 4th Gen	This one is great for music but does not recognize our voice and requests like the dots and show we have. We have dots and another couple Alexa’s put all around our house and this one is just not as responsive. Bass is good but that’s about it.	3	June 26, 2022	1
155	Echo 4th Gen	What I did not like about this product is it died the we got it.	3	July 26, 2022	1
156	Echo 4th Gen	I love Alexa’s and most echos. The house is filled with them. However this model has the worse possible sound for music. Massive bass that even using the EQ destroys any music. Mediocre mids and trebles. The previous generation was way better. What happened?	3	June 26, 2022	1
157	Echo 4th Gen	Somehow I feel like the echo dot is better than this. Set up is so annoying too, it has a hard time connecting to internet, and it'll speak in three different languages repeatedly during this process. The shape is really odd in my opinion, and I'll have to ask it multiple times to do things too which is super annoying. The studio version is something I wish I saved for instead.	3	June 3, 2022	1
158	Echo 4th Gen	"While the sound is much improved; I'd rather liked the method for which the volume was controlled in the Echo 1st Gen.  With Echo 1st Gen all you had to do was twist the top.  With the Ball 4th Gen, you have to go feeling for the +/-.  One added plus to the Alexa 4th Gen, is the battery attachment.  Today I am to receive the battery.  Let's hope it performs well.  Would I buy another 4th Gen; yeah, the sound is worth the cost.  Sure wish one could twist the upper half of the ball to adjust the volume; that would have been better.We have used the 4th Gen Alexa for 1/2 months; the only problem we have noticed is that, and I should first say; the 4th Gen is geared more toward digital devices, with that said; the problem it has is that it does not voice recognize our request to play music by ""U2.""  Its response is to direct us to enable ""youtube"" by using the Alexa app.  At the Alexa app, there isn't a method to solve this problem.  The only solution we found was to request a specific album or song from U2.  Then Alexa 4th Gen has a better chance at granting your request."	3	September 14, 2021	1
159	Echo 4th Gen	first one lasted 5 months so only 3 stars until I see if it lasts longer.  Return under warranty was a huge hassle.  Bought it on sale but reimbursement was for that price not replacement price.  Since it only lasted 5 months, should get the replacement for the price paid.  After much time on the phone with Amazon, they finally got it right.  liked the ring on the older version being on top better than this one that has it on the bottom, not a easy to see.	3	May 22, 2022	1
160	Echo 4th Gen	"I really am confused by the performance of my Echo 4th gen.My dot is working fine. I had high hopes and was excited for this one with the hub in it. I read all the reviews online and even watched people play it and compare speakers.I don't know if i got a ""lemon"" in the batches but mine has been malfunctioning repeatedly and sadly I think I have to return it :-( I'm really disappointed b/c I want an alexa device with an integrated hub and I got it at good value on a promotion.  I don't want to return it but I need it to work and now she is not responding, and when she does respond there is terrible feedback noise.Pluses:+ acts as hub+ color good+ design goodCons:- it often doesn't understand my voice from nearby and I have to ""shout"" or ""sternly"" give commands- the volume up or down doesn't always take affect and you have to repeat the command- the sound now started to get crackly and play static feedback with it - has started to ""ignore me"" and it will ligt up blue, i will say ""play jazz music"" and it doesn't do anything- i have a dot in a room nearby (but not close), and the dot will often pick up my voice in the enxt room, even though i am on the sofa sitting directly next to the hub one and the hub will not respond----update on review:amazon customer service did try to help. they are sending me a replacement one to see if it is a hardware issue on this specific device that i got. crossing fingers the new one is better.i did speak with the rep about the difference in amazon plus. vs. studio vs. 4th geninteresting to me that the echo plus 2 are still more expensive than the new 4th gen even though they are ""older"" technology.i suspect the plus 2 have the kinks worked out, wish the price would drop.and maybe some of these issues with my new 4th gen device are teething issues with it being a ""new and improved"" design and inner-parts.also an odd note on the customer service - the team that followe dup on a 2star review, they rang me and i asked to call back later. he mentioned he would email me - got the email, the instructinos said ""you can reply directly to this email"" so I took the time to reply to the email but then got the automatic response that said ""you are writing to an email that no longer accepts incoming messages"" s - so he won't see my response and the alternate contact path is to log a new ticket, which i've already done so i wont resend."	2	January 25, 2021	0
161	Echo 4th Gen	It works great as a simple Echo Dot, when it becomes to usability of the speaker capabilities it becomes almost impossible to use it, it change the volume by itself constantly, it keeps disconnecting, I contacted Amazon support and I spent an hour trying to solve the issues with no success, I need to highlight, the support team where very kind and they really tried to help.	2	October 24, 2022	0
162	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is great but then you have to deal with the constant pestering for you to upgrade to the premium package to enjoy more music. It seems every time I start to enjoy the sound quality of the device I'll ask it to play something else and it'll either tell me that song is only on the premium package and would I like to upgrade now to hear that song or I can hear the song but before I do I get asked again if I would like to get the premium package blah blah blah blah. Anyways good sound until you have to hear what alexa or what ever name you choose for your device has to say about blah blah blah.	2	September 14, 2022	0
163	Echo 4th Gen	"We wanted to love this with the premium sound and we have to say, the music quality is improved over the standard model. The issue is listening and responding to or commands. This echo seems ""hard of hearing"" whether it is playing music or just waiting for interaction. Frustrating problem. We don't know if it is defective and needs to be returned or it is a design flaw. Other reviewers have also mentioned the hearing/listening problem."	3	May 31, 2022	1
164	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this item to upgrade my Echo Plus in July 2021, after two months my Phillips Hue light bulbs stopped working with the unit.  When trying to troubleshoot the issue I lost the ability to restore or add light bulbs back to the Alexa smart home network.  In working with the Amazon team, a replacement device was sent but the same issue re-occurred in December 2021, almost the same time period as the prior unit.  As a hub device that works with Zigbee devices, Phillips Hue Lights should be listed needing a hub for it to work with this unit.I am not sure if other Phillips Hue users are having the same issue, this was my experience.  I would not suggest buying this Echo if you are a Phillips Hue user unless you buy the Phillips Hue Hub.Note: I also have other smart home items and I did not have a bad experience with those items, just the Phillips Hue Lights.	3	January 2, 2022	1
165	Echo 4th Gen	When I saw this design I knew immediately I had to have it. It's spherical look matched the look of the spherical lamps in my living room (Ikea Fodo lamps), purchasing with the intent of moving my Echo Plus to a different room in exchange for this new model being the living room's device.Right away I noticed the sound pickup is weaker than my Echo Plus. Having used the Plus for nearly three years in the same location, I was accustomed to a specific level of voice pickup, especially when first entering my home and prompting Alexa to turn on the lights. This new model needs me to speak much louder to throw my voice enough in order for it to pickup and respond accordingly. That's strike one.Next, while I love the design and the light ring makes sense at the base for this design, I decided very early on that the placement of the light ring at the base is counterintuitive as it's difficult to impossible to see if your prompt was recognized if your vantage point is obstructed; this was not the case with the Echo Plus with it's tall cylindrical design. That's strike two.Finally, the sound quality. Thinking it would sound better than the Echo Plus was logical given the Plus model is several years old and this new model boasts more size to house a decent speaker system. Modern audio devices have really stepped up their game with rich sound and deep bass, so I assumed this would perform exceptionally. Unfortunately, I found the audio quality to fall below that of the Echo Plus. I linked all my echo devices so that music will play across all the devices to fill my home. Walking from my living room (where this new Echo lives) into my art studio (where the Echo Plus was moved to) there is an undeniable difference in sound quality, with the Echo Plus clearly being the superior in sound. This new model suffers by not adopting the 360 sound of the Plus and also sounds to have weaker bass in comparison, even after matching the audio settings to the Plus. That's strike three, which is three strikes too many.My final analysis is that this new Echo isn't much more than a larger Echo Dot with the added benefit of the hub that allows integration with Hue bulbs.I will be placing my Echo Plus back into the living room and redesignating this new model as an Auxiliary device in another part of my home. I may purchase a better quality external sound system for it, but in any case, Amazon needs to revisit the Echo with more focus on sound than the physical design because I feel some sacrifices were made to make a product look pretty.	2	December 10, 2020	0
166	Echo 4th Gen	It’s a cool concept and I don’t know if mine is defective but it loses connection a lot. I know it’s not my internet because all of my other devices are fine. It will also just randomly crank up my music with no rhyme or reason. I checked and there’s no set schedule or routine for it to do that, it just does it. It gets what I say a lot of the time but sometimes I’ll say something crystal clear and it will not understand, even through it’s a direction I’ve given it before without issue. Sometimes it randomly shuts off but my phone app shows it’s connected and there’s nothing in the settings or routine to make it do that. The routines you can set only allow one “skill” per routine which is inconvenient. It could definitely use a lot of improvement and a cool feature would be options for different celebrity voices (like how WAZE does), not having to ask Alexa to ask a specific celebrity something to get their voice. It would also be nice if, not only would it turn on my tv by voice, but if it would also launch sling or paramount + or discovery + by voice too.  Accents, celebrity voices, better connectivity, more consistency, and the ability to search all of your streaming services for a specific movie or show you ask for, as well as record them if you’d ask it to would make it worth the price. As it is, kind of a rip off. If you really want one, get the dot. The price is more inline with what you get. The concept is great but a lot of room for improvement.	2	February 20, 2022	0
167	Echo 4th Gen	"A dud all around:1.  The globe shape takes up more space in every instance where it's put than its cylindrical predecessors2.  The internal temperature sensor is often inaccurate.  Apparently it updates no more often than every 30 minutes.3.  The buggy alexa app occasionally shows the echo 4 temperature on its status screen, but most of the time it doesn't display -- the temperature line is missing. Previous versions prominently displayed the temperature.4.  The temperature measures in C despite setting it to F in the alexa app.  The only way to change it is through a voice command to the echo.5.  Sound quality is markedly worse -- and is especially directional. Vocals are muffled and no amount of adjustment makes much difference.6.  The ""equalizer"" is still profoundly primitive with only three adjustment -- bass (which is already too heavy even at the lowest setting); midrange; and treble.7.  No digital signal processing?  This is 2021, not 2001.8.  The on-board processor(s) are very slow to react to commands -- and it's not related to the internet or WiFi.9.  Room speaker groups don't work -- one of the three speakers in the group will work fine and any of the three will work fine, but when asked to play in a group, two of the three speakers behave as if they have poor connections with glitchy sound that then drops in and out.  All are on the same WiFi dedicated network, and I've reset them multiple times.10.  The action light ring on the bottom is hard to see and is largely hidden by the globular shape.  The action ring is on in my image with a waiting notification -- can you see it?  Me neither.11.  There is some sort of sound-based occupancy sensor in this version of the echo -- again, doesn't work reliably, poorly documented; and poorly implemented and integrated with the buggy alexa app.12.  Still no way to interact with the echo devices using a web browser -- forced to use the buggy app.13.  Volume normalization across feeds is abominable.  Some sources, BBC World Service, for example are quiet -- others, such as the NPR feed are loud.  This should be tested before feeds are allowed to go live.  Even better, sound normalization should be automated in the cloud if not on the device.  It's maddening to be required to manually adjust the volume on EVERY SINGLE source!To say I am disappointed in these $100 duds is an understatement.I will be returning these ASAP."	1	November 16, 2021	0
168	Echo 4th Gen	"First, I could not use my desktop computer to link the echo to Alexa. I had to load the Alexa app onto my phone to do this and I do not like a lot of apps on my phone.  Second, and I'm not sure if it's because I have the volume up on the echo, the sound goes out on occasion, like a hiccup. I've tried unplugging, waiting then plugging back in, but that didn't help.  And finally, the echo seems to move across the table I have it on over several days use.  I have to keep moving it back into place.  The sound is not as good as I expected, being listed as ""premium"", but it is passable.  The unit is acceptable over all, but not exceptional or special."	3	February 26, 2022	1
169	Echo 4th Gen	I prefer the original cylinder style Alexa. This new one sounds a little better but it is too big -  it takes up too much space. I got the battery  base because I take Alexa with me - especially when I work outside. The cylinder Alexa is super easy to carry with one hand. I need 2 hands to carry the new Alexa.  To raise or lower the volume on the original, you only have to turn the ring at the top, something you can do in the dark.  The new version has a + and - symbol on the top to raise and lower the volume, very hard to find in the dark!  This is a much poorer design.  It's like the designers went backwards instead of forwards in making the new product. I am trying to decide if I keep it or return it.	2	August 9, 2022	0
170	Echo 4th Gen	"The speaker works well in a large room and we like the looks and color (blue), even though the cord is white. However, the Alexa apt is frustrating and has been since my first Echo Dot (original generation). Then, there's the Amazon Music Unlimited, which you would think would work great with the Amazon Alexa AND the Amazon Echo speakers. Well, I don't know which to blame, but here is an example: I paired my new 4th Generation Echo with my existing 1st gen. Echo Dot (in another room via the Alexa apt), then requested  an artist playlist (i.e. ""play music by Neil Diamond"") and they both worked - for a while. Then, after about six hours (which included Christmas music in March) the gen 4 Echo (mid-song) shut off while the old Echo Dot kept playing. Trying to correct the situation means: Stop Alexa, wait a while, then start over, if you're still inclined. This happens All the time when leaving on long enough. The sound volume also varies song-to-song so that I frequently manually turn the sound up or down. The sound quality is surprisingly good, otherwise. Alexa voice recognition, even after a substantial break-in period is ify: sometimes when requesting a playlist or song Alexa will want to sell me a book.Some artists play for hours and some for an hour, even though they have many more songs to their credit (i.e. Bill Medley played for one hour with three repeats of ""The Time of Our Lives""). If you have a lot of patience, have fun, but, sooner-or-later things get frustrating.Update: After contacting Amazon, a very helpful customer rep. guided me through a Factory Reset. Afterwards she promised the device would work 'perfectly'. It works worse. Now about tree hours both 4th Gen. Echo's hiss during playback then shut down with my original 1st Gen. Echo Dot still playing (on my 'everywhere' group inside our house). Then it took 6-7 attempts to get my old Echo Dot to stop. Before I purchased the two 4th Gen. Echo's, everything worked fine .. not 'perfectly', but fine. Good Luck! IF you buy these .. Still not sure if the problem is the new Echo's or Amazon Music Unlimited. Another update (4-20-21): While we do enjoy Amazon Music (when it works) and the sound is good .. the Echo is in a large room so I decided to add another for stereo and coverage .. call me stupid for still hoping for a good experience .. what convinced me to buy another (?) .. Amazon put it on sale and promised to include a free smart plug .. well, Amazon came through again and didn't include the smart plug and their customer service can't remedy. At least I got the sale price, but, I am increasingly NOT becoming a loyal Amazon customer. 6/10/21 Update: Alexa Sucks!: Frequently doesn't play what you ask for, or, when it does, stops playing, mid-song, when it wants, then freezes so you can't play any music until ""SHE"" feels like it (even doing a 'unplug' restart doesn't help). These speakers are marketed for Alexa and Amazon Music users and the experience (six months worth) is frustrating, maddening, and just plain bad."	1	March 5, 2021	0
171	Echo 4th Gen	Many features and settings that are not explained at all.  I keep running into strange behavior that I must go to internet to find the answer.  One more unexplained event and I will return the device.	3	June 20, 2022	1
172	Echo 4th Gen	"Update November 2021: I have taken this echo out of service. Last night I ask her to play Klove radio station for me. She said I needed to get Amazons music service.  Told her to stop and tried again. She wanted to play Christmas music.  Told her to stop. Ask her what the temperature would be and she started to play Christmas music. Took her out of service. Ask my echo show to play klove for 30 minutes. Her answer was ""playing klove fromm H..... I heart radio for 30 minutes.""I think Amazon had different clouds for different echos. I have my dots be down but my show5 works fine. My dots don't argue we me like this echo does and this on is always trying to get me to buy things, a lot more than dots and shows does.Original post: I have echos from the very first one to now including echo show 5.  The sound quality is the best of all.  This new one (4th generation) has problem of hearing you and understanding you. I almost have to yell to get her to hear me and then she doesn't understand. Example. I have lights with wifi bulbs (2 different brands)  I almost always have to tell her twice to turn on or off. I have a Amazon smart plug and the same.  easy to set up and easy to get other products to work with her.Update:  I’ve changed my post from 3 Stars to 1. She’s getting more hard of hearing. She went bonkers the other night and could only do a few commands. She kept telling me that she could not connect to the internet. All others were okay. I finally unplugged her then restarted. She then told me she needed to recalibrate. That’s a new one.Update: less than a hour after posting the update Amazon customer services called and worked through the problem. The wakeup name Alexa is a corrupted file. Changing to echo made it better.  We will see if that holds. Change from 3 stars to one. Will move It to 2 stars. If it holds i will change ratings to 3 or higher.UPDATE September 30 2021:I’m going to go back to one star. Her hearing problem is getting worse. She now argues with me. I tell her to turn on plug for porch and she gives ne the definition of a porch. I must tell her two times to turn on porch. She then tells me the porch is not a command. Go to another echo same command and porch comes on.I’ve decided to remove her and put in my old first generation puck in her place. It’s does not miss a command.After reading all the reviews about her hard of hearing I ordered anyway. My advice is don’t buy this one.For information the command to turn on porch was at 4:00 am nothing was on in room to distract her. And had to give command twice and hear what a porch was."	1	July 7, 2021	0
173	Echo 4th Gen	I was hoping this could be a cheaper solution for respectable surround sound for my house but the truth is that these are absolutely not the quality anyone would expect who is really looking to replace a sound system for easy plug n play wifi connected speakers. Yes they work, yes it is easy, NO these are not premium sound. Maybe they are premium in contrast to other echo devices but not comparable to other sound systems.You absolutely get what you pay for in this case…Cheap stuff yields cheap results.	2	September 28, 2022	0

175	Echo 4th Gen	"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Not good at responding to voice commands at all. Bass is good, almost too good, because you miss other sounds because it’s heavy. Design is bulky and catches constant dust.Worst of all, it now makes the sound in the video attached randomly and loudly.Woke up to it this morning. Only way to stop is to unplug for a while and replug. Not sure who to call and they don’t make it easy. Guess once the warranty runs out it’s designed to be a large paperweight?Note:First review was denied. Not sure what I did wrong since they won’t tell you that part but I’m assuming it was because I compared to other products they make and sell. It was all truth and no bad language or links. So it was either that or they don’t like bad reviews on their products. People need to know this stuff to make an informed decision."	3	April 23, 2022	1
176	Echo 4th Gen	Edit: Figured out the original issue, thank you reddit.  Now she works when she feels like it. Sometimes I'm 5 feet away and slowly raising my voice I get now responses to only a few moment later the TV says her name, and she starts having a conversation.  Other times she speaks quick gibberish to which my partner and I question our sanity, but mostly she throws out random facts then apologizes she's still learning. Which brings me to the next part.  She randomly dings, and blue ring glows for a few moments then done.  Totally random  and mostly at very quiet times.  Otherwise it's handy in a facts argument.I wish I could say this echo is great, or this thing sucks, but since I can’t fully use it because the Alexa App is the most discouraging, frustrating, EVIL, POS ever created! After 4 days of research I have resolved to just let the echo collect dust bunnies, and be a “think piece “ of “art”, the thinking part is Why did I buy this junk?! I have lived in the United States my entire life. My cell phone, smart TVs, and any other smart product I’ve ever own, have all been set to US English since day 1, I have never been anywhere where I’ve ordered anything to be shipped to another country. My Amazon apps, Spotify, YouTube,hulu, etc, are all set to US English. I do not own a vpn, BUT, BUT, BUT THE ALEXA APP Home Screen looks normal for me, English and everything, but try ANY link within the app, and BOOM SPANISH!! WTF?! And YES, I’ve tried everything freaking thing the internet, Amazon, geek squad, neighbor, the dog has recommended and Still royally and totally….well you know where this is going. F You Amazon App Developers you suck!	2	January 12, 2022	0

178	Echo 4th Gen	"I've had many Echo devices starting with my first when I was invited to buy a 1st gen before they went to market. I currently have 2 Echo Shows, 2 4th gen Echos, 2 Echo Dots and an Echo Auto. We've always like the Echo products...until recently. About a month ago, we went to bed and as usual  told Alexa to play our SleepyTime playlist. Sometime in the night, she stopped playing and when we tried to get the playlist going again she said she couldn't reach the internet. When I woke up the next morning, I found our internet was fine so I tried reconnecting the Echo. No matter what I tried, she would not connect. If I asked her a question, she would just reply with ""I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. The internet is not reachable. ""I even did a factory reset - still no good. Thinking it was bad, I went to Best Buy and bought another 4th gen Echo. It too too would not connect. I tried over and over - no good.  So, for kicks, I decided to use my wife's phone and her Amazon account and in the first attempt the device connected. To eliminate my phone as a problem. I opened a brand new Fire Tablet registered to me. I first updated the Alexa app and attempted to connect the 4th gen Echo to my account - no good. We've done coutless resets, but nothing works with my account. Her account, no problem. I have taken the Echo to my work and it does the same thing there as well. The problem with using my wife's account is that all of the other devices, Kasa plugs, Hue lights etc., are attached to my account. I had bought a pack of 4 Kasa plugs and they cannot attach to my account either. I can use them within the Kasa app, but cannot attach them to my Alexa account. Basically, my account is somehow damaged. I called tech support after about 10 days of trying to fix this myself. I was hung-up on twice, but eventually got someone in Echo tech support. After trying many things, even screen sharing from the new Fire tablet, the technician said that this was very unusual and should not be behaving like this. The devices register on my account, but they just won't work. She told me she and her team would need time to  investigate this issue and asked me for a good callback time for the next day. I said 5:30pm would be good. I never got the call and my devices still are not working. Through my efforts, I have eliminated my network, my phone, my tablet, the Alexa app, the Echo devices- everything but my Alexa account. I have no choice at this point but to give them a one star review until this is fixed."	1	October 20, 2021	0
179	Echo 4th Gen	So I love Alexa and most of the Alexa products.  I have the new-gen 4 to replace Gen 3 so it would have the hub.  The hub part works great.  However, when I am in the kitchen and the device is so close to me (same position as older model)  I have to yell at Alexa and wait (note; no music or anything playing) then speak the command.  In previous-gen versions, I have been able to talk at a normal volume and pace and Alexa picks up what I am saying right away.Now 1 of 2 things happen 1. I have to pause for 3 -4 seconds after saying Alex or it simply does not respond OR 2. the echo dot device in another room picks up the request and plays the response in that room.Also while it looks super nice compared to other models, the light indicator being at the bottom is almost useless.  If I have a notification I can't see the light , where when the light was at the top of the device you could see the light from a distance.  Now it's just hidden and pretty useless if you are not right on top of the unit.Also playing music on this is not nearly as loud or pronounced as previous gen models.  This sounds muted (so does the dot 4th gen) , sadly I feel like this 4th gen went down hill and not much able to be done about it if you're a alexa ecosystem. household	3	March 3, 2021	1
180	Echo 4th Gen	I really wanted to like the new Echo 4.And for sound quality is actually amazing. It's on par with a much more expensive speaker.But as an Echo device, It's actually worse than my echo 3 dot was.For some reason it barely recognizes my voice. So I need to call out the command word 2 to 3 times each time to get its attention.It also has some really eonky integration issues.For example every time I use it to control my fire TV it changes the size of the fire TV buttons and I have to reset the thing.I really wanted to like this and I thought it should have been a nice upgrade when my echo three dot stopped working. But instead it's somehow inferior on all of the Alexa parts, Even though the sound quality is really good.	3	January 20, 2022	1
181	Echo 4th Gen	"Update: Rating changed from 4 to 3 stars. The new devices (have 2 now and am kind of regretting it) are a step up with sound quality for sure. But the microphones and voice recognition are really poor. Have to repeat commands (even simple ones like ""end timer"") many times.  Heck, the devices have a hard time picking up ""Alexa"" wake word most of the time. Haven't looked at the internals, but guessing that the physical positioning of microphones in the new ball shaped package was ""good in theory"" but just poor design. Either that or the software upgrades are anything but.And Amazon is not doing anything about the ugly white cords and adapters. Shame. The round package could be cool - if it wasn't for the ugly white only cords and adapters (and performance issues of course). It is fine with the white one we have. It might even work for the blue. But it is gosh-awful with the charcoal unit. If a person wants a dark colored smart device, it is probably in part because the location needs a dark color. Tell me again how white cords/adapters make sense?-------------------------------------------------------------------Overall the device is a step up from 2nd gen device. Sound quality much improved and reasonable for price. Voice recognition not as consistent as with 3rd gen Dots for some reason.Huge esthetics issue: only have white cords and power adapters. REALLY UGLY with dark gray/black unit. Especially bad if putting somewhere that needs dark color.Money saving deal but come on Amazon. Y’all are better than this!"	3	January 10, 2021	1

183	Echo 4th Gen	I added this latest echo to my other 2 to get better music in my kitchen. The system is very good but there are three consistent annoyances I have with it:1. I can't stand the confirmation tone Alexa uses. I know it can't be changed (yet?) but this needs to be fixed ASAP. I'd rather nothing at all or a more pleasant tone I choose.2. When it comes to music, Alexa seems to be confused all the time. I find it very difficult to have all my speakers play at once. I have to add the phrase Everywhere or Everywhere group to my choice. Annoying at best.3. Alexa keeps moving around my system when it comes to the most rapid response time when I say the wake up word. I find this annoying as well.	3	February 2, 2022	1

It has been nothing but a constant hassle.  Nothing works as advertised.  Even after spending hours and hours and hours of time with customer service over years and years.  There are bugs that I reported over 2 years ago that still are not fixed.  Trying to use a stereo pair, forget it.  After over 5 hours with customer service my ""Stereo Pair"" only plays with one speaker.  This is only ONE example of of the problems I have had.  I have spent hours upon hours with their customer service.  I am immensely unhappy with this hardware and software.  It is a constant battle to keep things paired and working.  Phillips Hue lights that work just fine with the Phillips Hue app don't work in Alexa.  Their customer service tries to say it's the light.  Seriously, the light works with anything other than Alexa and yet their answer is that it's the light.  Again, just one more example of many, I mean many of the issues I have had.I am not kidding when I tell you that today I had had enough.  I got so mad I took all 3 of my echo devices outside and took a hammer to them.  I am not joking.  I will go to Best Buy today and buy a couple of Google Smart Speakers.Stay away form Echo and Fire TV.  They are full of bugs that Amazon is just never going to fix."	1	July 23, 2022	0
188	Echo 4th Gen	"If you're looking for QUALITY sound... much better than a Dot, not as good as a Studio.Honestly, I've owned this Dot Gen 4, the Echo Gen 4, the Echo Studio and none are really giving me what a good amp, good speakers do. A single source, stereo, even 360 degree, it just isn't happening with any Echo, Hype.Just ok sound, connectivity if not easily paired or set up, an Echo may fit your needs. Or your childs. Setting up multiple Echos for stereo pairs, the message I get, ""this device is not compatible, the proceed further ""next"", grayed out. With the Echo or the Echo Studio. But perhaps that's just me.UPDATE: HERE'S WHY I COULDN'T SET UP STEREO PAIRS between an Echo and my Studio. After a very polite and in one way helpful call(helped me set up a temp sensor Routine) with a very knowledgable Amazon tech support(thanks Chris L) about connecting Echos, Echo Studio in stereo pairs,""ONLY ALLOWS STEREO PAIRS OF LIKE DEVICES"". MEANING: NOT AN ECHO AND A STUDIO. NOT AN ECHO DOT AND AN ECHO. NOT AN ECHO STUDIO WITH AN ECHO.... LIKE DEVICES, EXACTLY. YOU CAN SET UP MULTI ROOM DEVICES THAT WILL THEN PLAY TOGETHER, NOT IN STEREO PAIRS.I'm told.WHAAAAAAT?????Temperature Sensor- a big reason to buy but it just doesn't perform, react to changes in temp fast enough to make this feature worth while. The sensor being ""in"" the Echo enclosure is heavily influenced by the enclosure temp itself(and everything inside). A big/rapid change in temp? the enclosure keeps the Echo from implementing in real time. Have a heater connected? Think this is great to turn on/off by temp? Very slow to respond to either a temp drop in the room(then it turns on the heater in a created routine) and then responds very slowly to turn the heater off when ""off"" routine temp is reached. Seems to me this is a case of an external temp sensor, not in the Echo enclosure would work much better. I tried it, just toooo slow to respond and I deleted the routines."	2	November 1, 2021	0
189	Echo 4th Gen	I have 4 echos. At first they worked beautifully. I liked being able to have the same program playing on all the devices while I worked around the house. However, the last couple of weeks I can barely get one device to play.  I can’t figure out what is wrong.5/3/21 update: When I posted the above paragraph, I received a call from Amazon customer service, and was given some steps to take to correct the problem.  They are all working fine right now.  Fingers crossed.One of my favorite things to do with the Echos is to have them all play the same radio station.  As I walk around the house doing my chores, I can listen to the music wherever I am.There's lots more the echos can do.  I'm sure I have only scratched the surface.Update 5/4/21: Customer service helped me yesterday and the echoes worked fine after that.  Now I am  having intermittent problems again where one or more of my echos stop playing.  I don't know what is going on.  I am not very tech savvy and it is irksome that this keeps happening.  My echos (I have 4) worked beautifully together for the first couple of weeks and now I keep having these issues. So I am dropping my rating back to 3 stars for now until I can get this problem resolved.	3	May 2, 2021	1
190	Echo 4th Gen	"As a speaker, this is pretty good.  I like the Alexa control.  But I bought it to play my CDs on a stereo and have them play throughout the house (on 4 Echo Dots).  It took a little work to play the Line-In on the Echo, but as soon as I tried to play in on the ""Everywhere"" network, it dropped the Line -In and played from from Amazon Music.  I looked on some posts and found other complaints and questions.  LINE-IN DOES NOT WORK ON ANYTHING BUT THE ECHO WITH THE CONNECTION!  Don't get this if you think it will work as the description implies.  It can play the Line-In on the Echo, and it can play music to multiple Echo speakers, but IT CAN'T DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME (and they do not say this)."	3	January 8, 2022	1
191	Echo 4th Gen	I've had an Echo device since the original was in pre-order, and I got it for $100. Last year, we finally decided it had gotten old enough and traded it in for a new one. That was a mistake.The new Echo's want to be so helpful. Want some music? They'll gladly tell you all about Amazon's Music Unlimited subscription service, that just so happens is NOT included with Prime. Want to listen to the news? It'll turn on TuneIn, which'll make you listen to up to 10 minutes of commercials before actually playing the news. Want to track your Amazon purchases? It'll happily give you notifications, sometimes even without you asking or wanting them, about where your packages are.When the Echo starts blinking yellow, you're supposed to ask it what the notification is. Most of the time, it'll tell you about a Subscribe & Save item that's being delayed, or a package got delivered, etc. But sometimes, it'll recommend a book that you have absolutely no interest in.The book recommendations were my last straw. A little backstory first. As far as I can tell, out of roughly 1500 purchases I've made on Amazon in the last decade, perhaps 5 of them have been books, and none of them for me. They've all been cookbooks, or kids books, as gifts for others. So why, in the name of all that's holy, does the Echo insist on giving me notifications for random books that will be coming out? I don't want them. I don't care what they are. I have never, in the 8 years of owning an Echo, purchased a book through it. I've never asked it to read a book to me. I've never used it to play an audiobook. There is no overlap between what I've told it to do or what I've used it for, and upcoming book releases. That venn diagram is 2 circles with a mile between them. Yet, you CAN NOT disable these notifications. No amount of settings changes, or account updates, or even calling Amazon Tech Support, will remove them.I do not want book notifications. For that reason, I just bought a Homepod Mini, and I'll be returning my Echo. Maybe if Amazon updates their pushy marketing tactics, I'll get another one, but it's not likely.	1	April 10, 2022	0
192	Echo 4th Gen	"So got a second gen 4 Echo and sub, and when the link up properly then they sound great. It does not always link. Sometimes just plays out of one speaker. The other issue I have with it is the voice commands for audible. You would think that since audible and Alexa are Amazon properties, they would work well together. However, I often, although asking for a certain book to continue, get the last book I listened to starting up. Then when I ask for the sleep timer to be set to 15 mins, something it does it perfect. Other times it sets a timer for 15 mins and audible shutdowns within 30 seconds. Even thought I use the same command each time ""Alexa set sleep timer for 15 mins"".  So I give it 3 stars due to issues to me that cause frustration. But over all the sound is good for a wireless setup."	3	December 14, 2021	1
193	Echo 4th Gen	I see that the big ball has great reviews but I think it might be from people who have never had an Alexa device before or they strictly use this for playing music. I have had the 2nd generation Echo dot, the hockey puck looking one for over 2 years and it has worked great for talking to it and music very crisp and clear and it picks up my voice very well (hears good) and responds. Now I see this new one the 4th generation big ball with a 3 inch speaker that is supposed to give great quality sound which it does sound very good for what it is playing music but the downfall vs the 2nd generation Dot is even with the bass turned down and the treble turned up when she talks it is not crisp and clear, it has a muffled sound making it hard to hear her with any background noise like tv going at same time, so that is annoying and the big ball doesn't hear very well, sometimes not hearing what I said at all and other times she is lit up listening but not answering at all so have to ask again and again very disturbing.  I am going to keep the ball and plug in when I want music but continue to use the Echo Dot 2nd generation for all the talking to her throughout the day at least this one hears and answers back almost always and the sound for talking is so much clearer and crisp.	3	January 17, 2021	1
194	Echo 4th Gen	The main reason I bought this was for my husband. My husband has a hard time hearing when we use the TV built-in speakers especially when the show has music that is so loud it drowns out the voices. I hooked it up paired it through the Alexa app, and changed the preferred speakers to Echo, and still, the TV sound would not come out of the Echo. I called support and after she put me on hold several times, she came back and had me blue-tooth the Echo to the TV through the Settings menu. After that, the sound did come out of the Echo, but the sound quality is so quiet I had to turn the volume all the way up to hear it, which made it still not as loud as the TV speakers. With the volume all the way up, Alexa is extremely loud. I called tech support again to ask if there is a way to turn down just Alexa's voice so it is not booming. There is not. One more note...Echo Alexa does not always understand commands. You have to say, Alexa, turn on FireTV...because if you say Turn on the TV, it just says that feature is not available...or something to that effect. Pretty awful. Returning it.	1	October 8, 2022	0
195	Echo 4th Gen	"Sound quality is very good.  I ""downgraded"" from my Echo Show, gave it to my daughter, because the sound quality in the echo is much better.However, it has a HUGE glitch.  About 50% of the time it does not respond to the wake up word, ""Alexa"" and when it does, another 50% of the time it tells you that the device, lamp, is not connected.  However, when you tell it to turn the lamp on/off gain it will do it.Another issue I'm having is that you ask it something and it will answer something else. i.e ""Alexa what's the weather?"" Answer, ""CNN breaking news...""I thought it might have been my voice, although I've had no problems with previous echo products, so I Asked my daughter to talk to it and the same thing happened.I like the product, just wish Amazon would update the software to fix the issues."	3	December 4, 2021	1
196	Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded to Amazon Music Unlimited and received HD music also. The old dots where working find but wanted to create a stereo pair with better sounding speakers. So I purchased the Echo thinking I would have a sonic experience. What has been the result is as follows. The sound is great until the stream stops. This has been a recurring problem since upgrading and purchasing the speakers. I will tell Alexa to play either my playlist or an artist and it starts out fine. Then partway into the first song it will drop out but then starts again. It will play again with no problem for a few songs and then repeat. Not the sonic experience I was looking for. I have tried on at least 3 occasions contacting Amazon and finding a fix. They have been polite but have offered no solution besides restart everything, start from scratch and disconnect the the devices and the internet and reconnect in reverse order. Nothing has worked. I have a robust connection and stream 4K regularly. I am going to reach out to Amazon one more time and if that does not provide relief I will just drop the unlimited music and give Apple a test run.	3	August 16, 2021	1
197	Echo 4th Gen	Though this echo has far better sound quality than my old Echo Dot, its user interface is much worse than the Dot was. She constantly just stops interacting in the middle of skills and cannot hear or understand me anywhere near as well. I used to be pretty impressed by how well my Dot could understand me from across the room and assumed that this new Echo would be just as good if not better. Nope.I still enjoy the sound quality although it’s not as good as my Bose countertop speaker is (as I would expect). I get frustrated with this echo constantly just not responding when I talk to it or just stopping in the middle of using certain skills.	3	February 16, 2022	1
198	Echo 4th Gen	Bought this to replace a 1st Gen Echo and was really disappointed. The sound quality was worse and had a hollow tone. You could correct a little with the app but never got to the quality of the original we had.Another big factor for our change was the mic on our 1st gen just wasn’t as responsive after all these years and we found ourselves always yelling at Alexa. However, when we set up this new Gen 4 Echo we found it performed worse than the original. So much so, that the Gen 4 sphere would ignore our commands while the G1 which we moved to a further room away was still picking up our commands.  I’d fault a good bit of this to placement location of the two units, as it’s a little close to a tv but I’m doing an apples to apples comparison of the two different units in the same spot under the same lifestyle home conditions.  We gave it about 14 days of testing before we gave up and decided to return.Also, I’m not sure the spherical design is really any better stylistically or practically. It seems to take up more space and having the light ring on the bottom means you can’t really tell when Alexa is actually hearing your commands.  We ended up repeating ourselves quite often because she just wasn’t acknowledging we were speaking to her. Plus from a volume control standpoint the ring can no longer provide a visual queue as you can’t see all the way around the sphere. Obviously you can ask Alexa what her setting is volume wise, but sometimes you just want to see.Lastly, we bought a blue one. It’s neat that it’s not black like all of our other echoes and dots. But, the exact shade of blue actually wasn’t that appealing once we had it in our house.  It’s almost like they couldn’t decide which shade of blue to use so they just went with blah in the end.Biggest Pro:  I like the idea of the new colors.Biggest Cons: sound quality and mic sensitivityExtra note - we did link it with the multi room sound playback and that feature was easy enough to set up and integrated our G1 Echo with this G4 Echo seamlessly.  It also pointed out more sound flaws though as the G1 outperformed in the end with providing a more dynamic and balanced room filling sound.	2	January 10, 2021	0
199	Echo 4th Gen	If the volume is more than half then voice recognition is not good. Sound quality is ok for the cost.	3	June 23, 2022	1
200	Echo 4th Gen	The first generation Alexa has always been the best at everything.  Build quality is far superior	3	June 27, 2022	1
201	Echo 4th Gen	"21SEP2021: I wanted a smart device to control my home and answer my questions. Alexa on Echo uses Amazon's proprietary search engine. Google is the gold standard for search engines, in my humble opinion. Amazon's engine meets the level of aluminum; the most abundant metal on earth. The Echo device is very capable as far as the hardware is concerned. However, the software, and the search engine in particular, is junk. After 6 months, I quit. I must admit that I now own a very expensive voice activated switch system that understands me 50% of the time.19FEB2022: I am happier with Ziggy. His voice is more pleasing to my ears. I call him ""Computer"". I miss him when I'm away from home but have yet to find an affordable option so he can travel along with me. My smartphone won't keep Alexa running without quickly sucking the battery dry; even connected to power in the car. However, I am finding that the Alexa software is getting smarter and there are more skills and blueprints available now. I am hopeful that this trend will continue. Thank you devs!!"	3	September 14, 2021	1
202	Echo 4th Gen	Searar is an odd shape for electronic device. It does not look modern. Audio quality is superb for the size. It’s a great idea to include the Zigby hub. However even Amazon is confused on what devices are supported to directly work with this device. I could not find sensors that reliably work with this echo fourth generation. Awara sensors don’t work, Amazons on ring sensors don’t work. It is a great product with an odd shape but Amazon still does not have the complete story on this yet. Best sensors use Seaver, but Amazon abandoned zwave in this echo. Sphere is an odd shape that does not match the modern angular/square decor. Sadly, I retuned mine.	3	February 17, 2022	1
203	Echo 4th Gen	"I have 11 of these in my house and they used to be great.  Extra beeps started to happen some months ago and now when you wake the device it beeps at you in mid-sentence (I have that setting off on all).  Also, my kitchen Echo always attempts to play all music to Sonos, which I have disconnected (including the skill) more than 1 year ago. When it can't it errors and doesn't play any music at all. I have replaced the device with a new one and the new one does the same. The other devices do not do this Sonos attempt. Also, when I give a command 75% of the time the devices continue to talk about other subjects (""By the way....""). This is really awful.  There are other issues, but these are really annoying and fairly new (last year or so)"	3	December 12, 2021	1
204	Echo 4th Gen	I just upgraded my five Echo gen 1 to gen 4. Sound quality is much better but amazon music unlimited doesn't work with multi room listening. It will work for 5 to 20 minutes then start glitching out badly. It worked fine with my gen 1 units. Pandora works fine. Tech support can't  figure out what is wrong i have spent quite awhile on the phone with them. I think it has to do with HD audio streaming to multi rooms but im told there is no way to turn off HD audio to the echos. If they fix the issue down the road Ill be very happy with the upgrade and would give 5 stars. Until then I am paying monthly for Music unlimited and tell Alexa to play from pandora whenever I want multi room music.	3	December 30, 2021	1
205	Echo 4th Gen	"When you buy this product it's weight and circular design makes it not stable at all. It does have a screw in adapter on the bottom that some sort of stand can be inserted but associate did not mention nor was there anything written on the box it comes in to let you know and no ""stands"" near product to sell. Alexa at times does not get right response from your requests and has already fallen twice off a chair when using outside."	2	September 19, 2022	0
206	Echo 4th Gen	The sound is good, and when it works it’s good. But this thing is so temperamental. When playing music via either Amazon prime, or Apple Music (the source does not matter), it will just stop. Sometimes several minutes in, sometime 40 seconds into the first song. It’s not an internet issue as other devices are fine, and there is no internet drop. I’ve also had it just start playing one song on loop. I also have it connected to fire TV so I can watch tv with sound coming out of the echo. It works, but again there are so many bugs. Often the remote becomes i operative and echo becomes unresponsive. Sometimes randomly their is just no sound and instead fire tv plays sound out of the tv speakers instead. And then randomly, echo will turn the tv on, when nothing is playing or requested. It’s so buggy that I’m about to throw it away. I have some other Alexa devices, Including a really early version before the echo dots (without built in speaker). One is in my garage and I have it plugged into an old stereo for sound. It works perfectly, streaming same music sources. So it’s not an internet connection issue. This echo is just not good software. These issues are all over google, and the answer is simply to have to unplug it and wait to reconnect to reset it. Doing this several times a day is not acceptable.	2	January 24, 2022	0
207	Echo 4th Gen	I use other speakers for sound so that isn’t a thing to me.  We do use it constantly for our curtains, lights, fans, etc.  The white cord is ridiculous.  The form factor is neat but makes the blue light more difficult to see.Setup was difficult.  It glitched on the first go and so the app kept looping to “setup your new echo device despite having set it up 5 times.  I reset it and started over. The light now lights up.It doesn’t hear me any better or get the commands correct more frequently than the previous generation.  I constantly get “x device doesn’t support that” followed by the command being carried out the next time I say it.  It integrates horribly with my firetv stick (so did the previous generation) where “launch Hulu on firetv” gives me a 50/50 split of “that skill is not enabled” and “launching Hulu on firetv”.I have 3 alexas in 3 different rooms spanning about 2000 square feet.  The microphones are too good so more often than not 2/3 of them hear the wake word and (I guess?) assume the other one will follow out the command so neither does it.  The new Alexa asked me yesterday if I was talking to it or a different Alexa.  I corrected it but it hasn’t helped anything.The only positive here is that when it gets a command right, specifically with SmartThings, it is a little faster.Our echo does not sit directly under the tv.  It would be neat if the echo would work for as read sound or atmos sound for your tv.  It does not.  It will only work as a tv speaker with our firetv stick which means the sound comes out from a weird place in our room.*****Update****. It’s garbage.  I have to yell for it to hear me and when it does, it ignores my command or gets it completely wrong;  “I’m sorry, X device doesn’t support that” randomly only to work perfectly the next time.  The microphone is worse than the firetv cubes by 10.  The old microphone was so much better.  If I could return this I would.  If you want better sound get an Echo Studio or SONOS instead.Update 2: If I wasn’t so lazy I’d go find our old one in the basement.  This thing doesn’t hear me, ignores me…seems to hear me then ignores me.  What the heck happened here?  Who thought this was a good idea?  How is this 5 stars?Space heaters and fans defeat this. Worried about Alexa hearing your conversations? Just turn on your ceiling fan or a space heater.  FYI- The Sonos/Alexa in our garage works with 2 industrial fans blowing at high speed 4 ft away from it.	1	October 25, 2020	0
208	Echo 4th Gen	"This is not a premium speaker by any stretch of the imagination. The microphone is not good at all. It takes a few shouts to get it to know I'm speaking to it, and then it doesn't hear any of us clearly (our shopping list os now a guessing game) **And the fact that Amazon CALLED MY HOUSE ON A SATURDAY NIGHT without warning and sent me an email to ""talk about my review"" was very off-putting to say the least."	2	September 17, 2022	0
209	Echo 4th Gen	What a waste of money. I upgraded from a 2nd gen dot when Amazon offered me a good price on this one.  I waited weeks for delivery only to be charged the full price and received a device that seems to be deaf and lazy.  At least once or twice a day Alexa ignores my voice (it sits maybe 3 ft from my office desk) and randomly quits playing in the middle of a song.  No break in wifi, no interruption other than she just doesn't feel like doing it anymore.Total ripoff.	3	April 6, 2022	1
210	Echo 4th Gen	No matter what I did, it would only set up connecting to my Sonos Arc. So I had to put my echo 2nd gen back in my bedroom and return the echo 4th gen. It was nice looking I can't comment on sound because it would only play stuff through my Sonos Arc which sounds very good. But I wasn't willing to spend $99 for something that would only alert me of packages being delivered. All of the other sounds timers and alarms would go through the Sonos Arc which it does by itself. I am disabled I can't fight with these devices to make them work correctly.	3	March 2, 2022	1
211	Echo 4th Gen	I don't have a lot of expectations of Alexia. What the Echo Gen 4 does well, it does well. However, when it fails, it does so fantastically. My biggest complaint is that I get it, Echo, Amazon product, Echo is really just a way to drive and direct traffic, particularly consumer traffic to Amazon, but for God's sake it gets a little... unwelcomingly forceful about it sometimes.Build quality of the unit is good.The sound quality is okay. Stereo speakers could be configured a tiny bit better to try to get a little more spread out of them but really nothing can really be done when you cram a left and right channel so close together. Bass, is... bassy. The midrange is okay and the treble is fairly clear without getting too tinny. Voice recognition is okay, when you call her, 95% of the time she hears you.However....This is the real issue. Alexia isn't so good at understanding what you are asking her/of her. Sometimes the results are humorous, but over time that novelty wears off and it just gets irritating.Also... The search engine is BING??? BING??? Really??? Why?!?!?!? Who actually uses BING?!?!?!Hey pssst... Amazon, one word... Google.Integration to lighting systems good. No real complaints there except when Alexia decides to randomly poo the bed because she can't understand what you are asking of her.	3	May 24, 2021	1
212	Echo 4th Gen	"I was looking forward for the new 4th generation Alexa: promised better sound, better home integration, nice looking!  I bought the device to replace my 2nd generation Alexa device that we use in the kitchen/breakfast area.The device does have better sound playback overall. We use it primary for music.  But the device has several issues that make it worse than our ""old"" Alexa: (1) there seems to be a problem with the microphone. It does not capture the voice commands as good as the old device.  Sometimes we have to raise our voice so loud that the ""old"" alexa responds (and she is at the loft at the second floor!).  Most of the times, the commands do not come as intended.  I can hear from the playback of the commands in the history page that they are not as crisp as the ones recorded in the old device. (2) the smarthome integration embedded in the new alexa fights with our current smarthings hub all the time.  When scanning the sensors we see duplicates for most of them: one from the smarthing hub and another one from the alexa device.  Deleting the ones from alexa builtin smarthome hub fixes the issue.  The new alexa does have a better sound, but we resorted on swaping it for our ""old"" alexa instead and move the new alexa to the second floor, where it is rarely used."	3	February 6, 2021	1
213	Echo 4th Gen	It vibrates the bass. Can’t have it turned up at all.	3	June 25, 2022	1
214	Echo 4th Gen	"Upgraded from a Echo Dot 3rd gen and I was hoping for better sound. I got way better sound over the Dot. It sounds so much better. I got a free ring light that uses this model as a hub and so far it has worked great together. Works fast when charging light settings.I also hit a few issues that seem like issues with this model. One issue that I have over the my Echo Dot is with Bluetooth. When connected it works great and never disconnects but the fight to get this echo to see my phone is a struggle. Saying ""Connect to my phone"" works rarely. On my Echo Dot its works more around 95% of the time. Once connected though there are no issues with sound or dropping. Second issue is that it seems harder to get it to respond to ""Alexa"". I end up saying it over and over getting louder each time till I feel like I'm yelling at it. Since its 2 feet away on my desk this seems a bit strange. Again the Echo Dot didn't have this issue.Edit: After using it more my Bluetooth issues are worse. I don't now if it's a hardware or software issue but I'm thinking of returning it now."	3	June 25, 2021	1
215	Echo 4th Gen	I had a first generation Echo that I exchanged to get this new echo. To my disappointment this one doesn’t listen well AT ALL. The sound quality it top notch, but her voice recognition and listening is terribly sub par.I’ve used it in 3 different spaces and that has made little difference. The only time she responds consistently is when I’m within 4 feet or really yell.In fact, my two echo dots ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE respond more consistently to me than this one does. I was literally 10 feet away from this echo and asked it to set a timer and both of my other echos (which have walls and hallways between me and them) responded to me and the one that had a clear line of sight and sound, didn’t even engage.If you’re looking for excellent sound, this will get the job done. If you’re looking for another child that doesn’t listen and often misunderstands what you said, this will also get the job done.I’d get the smaller echo dot clock before I’d get this, if my mom or grandma were to ask my opinion.	1	October 2, 2022	0
216	Echo 4th Gen	I've owned Echos since the original Echo Dot.  3rd Gen Echo had better microphone pickup I guess.  If it hears me at all while I'm facing away from the little gray ball of frustration it often gets what I say wrong.  Maybe it is a good thing that Alexa is losing her hearing in her old digital age.  At least I'm less worried about digital spying by Amazon.  Though it could just be a ploy.	2	September 10, 2022	0
217	Echo 4th Gen	First of all why is it that my friends can ask the google assistant on their phone the same exact question that I ask Alexa and they get an in depth thorough response and i get nothing. Or i have to go find and download some skill in order to make her more knowledgeable on something when google is capable of finding the answer and reading it. I have the same problem with Siri on my iPhone, Siri and Alexa are both idiots in my opinion and rarely do they actually do what I ask or answer a random question i have like google does. I wish i had realized this sooner and ordered a google home device speaker or something other that Alexa. I love the ability to play pretty much whatever music i ask but that comes with a music subscription and that's the speakers job so again nothing really to brag about.	3	October 30, 2021	1
218	Echo 4th Gen	"I echo (ha) the sentiments of other reviews. For whatever reason, the microphone really struggled with me. Commands like ""Alexa, lights at 20% brightness"" or even ""Alexa, lights on"" often failed to register. And when they did, there were often multi second delays. I recently switched to the echo studio for the sound quality, and was surprised with its responsiveness in contrast to the gen 4. It barely drops commands and processes stuff swiftly, despite lacking the newer processor and other tech in the gen 4.As for the sound, well that part's subjective. I wasn't very into how bassy the tuning was, and how much audio processing there seemed to be. YMMV.I'm glad I didn't give up with the echo after my bad experience with the gen 4. Even my brief experience with the echo studio has painted clearly that Alexa is a capable and fast assistant-gen 4 just seems to be a poor hardware to support it. And judging by the recent barrage of low scoring reviews, I'm not alone."	2	May 7, 2022	0
219	Echo 4th Gen	Plain and simple - this model starts talking when I don’t call for it, doesn’t do what I ask when I do call for it. It’s like it does not understand human voices or something. I traded up to get better sound and overall functionality, but it ended up being a level down from an old echo dot it replaced. Waste of money.	3	May 2, 2022	1
220	Echo 4th Gen	I wouldn't buy any echo device again.  I have 4, one is this model. All of them are very glitchy about when they work. Sometimes alexa says it will play music and then nothing happens,  mostly it plays something completely different than what you say. It's so frustrating to have purchased something that works so terribly.  It got worse and worse as time goes on, I've had almost 2 months now and my window to return is over. I do not recommend purchasing an echo device.	2	September 1, 2022	0
221	Echo 4th Gen	Wish for the price, it would respond better than the other echo devices. It's the worst. This is in my kitchen, it spends most it's time giving long winded definitions to words, instead of just giving the weather or playing music. It's a gift best for people who annoy you.	3	May 11, 2022	1
222	Echo 4th Gen	Seems that Alexa's hearing problem is how she recognizes her name. If your voice does not sound very close to how you said her name when you trained her to hear you she does not respond. Re training your voice may help just keep in mind that when you do the training try to pronounce her name at different pitches and volumes so she recognizes you more. It helped me out some but not perfectly.  I think the microphones are under her felt covering making it a little harder for her to hear the correct pronunciation of her own name. That's my best guess.Ok I love Alexa devices. I have 6 various devices in my home.  But this newer echo does not impress me. First of all the voice recognition for me is terrible. I don't know where they hid the microphones but it rarely hears me and it sits about 3ft from me. The earlier version does a better job so much so that i put the last edition near me and the new one out in living room. The new one seems to hear better when farther away from you.As for the sound i like the 360 sound much better that the new directional front facing sound in the new echo. The new echo does have better mid range but the 360 just sounds better it the place i put it.	3	December 28, 2020	1
223	Echo 4th Gen	Ordered the new Echo and it is much larger than expected. It's larger than a softball and not nearly as sleek as previous Echo units. It is VERY obvious in the room. The overall sound is much improved and its voice recognition seems on par with other Alexa devices. It has repeatedly disappointed me with its seeming inability to play Spotify playlists when specifically requested. Unlike previous Echo devices, it also seems unable to be used as a playback device from within Spotify, as the phone app continuously tries to connect with the Echo to no avail. Meanwhile, the music plays from my phone and all the other Echo devices that I own - from 1st-gen Echo to last-gen Dot - are available and ready to play the music. Just in the wrong room. A disappointment.	3	November 29, 2021	1
224	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality is barely adequate when listening to music.  Voice recognition is good.	3	June 14, 2022	1
225	Echo 4th Gen	Pensé que el sonido era mucho mejor	3	June 23, 2022	1
226	Echo 4th Gen	This is the third Echo we have owned. The other two are second generation ones. Those two are awesome and have just been moved to other areas of the house. This echo is by far the worst. Imagine having a bot that is like an unruly child. Never listening. Always having to have instructions repeated three or four times. You can stand two feet from this device and clearly annunciate your request and nothing. It will light up to its name but then it fails to do anything. Meanwhile devices in entirely different areas of the house spring into action. On the off chance this one actually responds be prepared for a wait of 30-60 seconds before it does anything. I am almost at a point of kicking this aptly shaped ball of electronic failures to the curb. Rubbish. Absolute rubbish.	3	November 28, 2021	1
227	Echo 4th Gen	So I bought this thinking Alexa would be able to easily integrate into my lights and for questions. But to be quite honest I'm mostly disappointed. I'll ask her questions and I get a lot of I'm not sure of that one. Or I don't know how to do that. Especially when I connected my lights she said lights are unable to turn off when they are clearly smart lights specifically designed for Alexa. It's quite frustrating.	3	April 15, 2022	1
228	Echo 4th Gen	You will be repeating yourself alot to get this devices attention.  The sound quality is just about OK. The only positive I can find, is that I didn't pay full price for it	2	October 17, 2022	0
229	Echo 4th Gen	Works well for a smaller bedroom but can have trouble hearing your voice if you call Alexa in a lower normal voice.Alexa definately needs YouTube music integration. I already had playlists set up and feel like I'm being forced to use other apps like Amazon music unlimited to have the same access.Bluetooth works fine for music but would be nice for it to have low latency bt features so you can use the good audio quality for an alternate tv audio source without the delay when watching a movie or show.Pretty satisfied but I think this should have been no more than 49.99.	3	January 22, 2022	1
230	Echo 4th Gen	The awesome sound of this new Echo is perfection. The audio is superb. That being said, all the reviews about the “new” microphone sensitivity are true. The mic is awful.

231	Echo 4th Gen	I don’t want my “smart device” to do anything except what I ask.  If I ask it for the current outside temperature, just give me the temperature.  I don’t need a “by the way, I can also help you with ____”.  This terrible feature can’t be turned off and is so frustrating it makes me just not want to use the device as it happens way too often.  Also the sound quality is ok except the bass is way too high.  Even with the bass turned all the way down it’s too much bass!  I feel guilty playing music in my apartment building because I feel like my neighbors can hear it.	2	July 23, 2022	0
232	Echo 4th Gen	My old Echo Dot second generation had a clearer sound and better voice recognition than this model. I thought it would improve with some equalizer tweaks but it was just okay and only stays for a minute.Voice recognition only is successful if I am standing within 5-6 feet or if I yell.I need to see if I can get my old one back or new model or I don’t know. I’m sure Amazon will help me figure this out.	2	August 23, 2022	0
233	Echo 4th Gen	It’s good for alarms , reminders ,  not so good at integrating with YouTube, Spotify !	3	June 5, 2022	1
234	Echo 4th Gen	My beef with this product is as follows:1) despite multiple people requesting it, Amazon refuses to create the ability to turn off Alexa saying “Now connected to [your name]’s” iPhone whenever you connect a device2) Alexa will randomly say something to you even though you didn’t give her a command. Super creepy that it’s always listening + has so many issues with thinking you gave her a command	2	September 6, 2022	0
235	Echo 4th Gen	I had an Echo 2 for about 5 years and it stopped working suddenly.  I bought this and expected better sound, it isn’t as crisp.	3	May 28, 2022	1
236	Echo 4th Gen	We have echo's all over the house.  Used them for years.  Our primary echo is in the kitchen which can be heard in the dining and living rooms.  Reading that the sound quality was so good, we decided to try this.  Well first, we didn't really like the looks.  Hard plastic rounded up the back and just not that good looking.  I know that is a personal choice.Now, if you are buying this for great louder sound, for anyone that has used echo's before, you know a echo remote is great for speaking to it and controlling the volume.The echo remote does not function on this and 4th gen devices which means we have to yell at the echo to try and do anything.  This is not only annoying and most of the time doesn't hear us but the loud requests are heard all over the house which lights up all the other echo devices.If you are close and want to control it manually, it sounds great but a little expensive.We sent it back and going for a 3rd gen echo but currently having problems with the echo remote on these devices.  If we want to use the remote we may have to  go back to our 2nd gen echo.	3	January 22, 2021	1
237	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this as an upgrade for the hockey puck I had that never heard me. This one does have better sound but I think it hears me even less. I keep it about two feet away from the bed and sometimes I have to shout more than once and I REALLY hate shouting! No wonder they removed the whole “whisper” commercial, huh!	3	April 26, 2022	1

239	Echo 4th Gen	I just unboxed my 4th gen Echo an hour ago. I ordered the Charcoal color because it will sit on top of my home theater’s BLACK subwoofer. The first thing I noticed was that the charger and cord are white! That’s going to look just great snaking across the top of the subwoofer!!!I have places in my home where I want white devices with white cords but sometimes I need a black device with a black cord. What ever happened to “The customer is always right?” Would giving us a choice be such a hardship?My white 2020 Echo Show 5 came with a white cord. Perfect. My black 2018 Echo Spot came with a black cord. Perfect. My black 2016 1st Gen Echo came with a black cord. Perfect. How was I to know that all of a sudden Amazon was going to turn into Apple and make nothing but white adapters and cords?And on top of everything, I can’t even swap cords with one of my other devices because the little proprietary plugs are different sizes!You can see I’m pretty deep into Echo land but my brother just got a Google device which he says is great. And then there’s the fact of my iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air and Apple Watch. Maybe there are HomePods in my future?	3	December 13, 2020	1
240	Echo 4th Gen	After having use this device for about a year it stopped  connecting to Amazon servers.  After several hours of attempting the various fixes shown on the web to reconnect Internet, I contacted Amazon the following day and discovered that Amazon had without notice or consent transferred my device serial number to an unrelated persons account making the device unusable for me. Over the past several days I have tried to get a response to fix this or simply send a new device but Amazon has yet to contact me back with a solution.  Obviously that’s the problem because it makes the device completely unusable. But it also raises legitimate security and privacy concerns about how a device could be transferred to another account and why there was no process for providing notification and consent to approve such transfer. This seems to be a serious problem, that concerns me given that I have numerous Amazon devices.I encourage other customers to ask questions regarding their security and ability to protect the devices from being transferred before they purchase.  I will update if Amazon solves this problem and identifies how it happened.	2	March 6, 2022	0
241	Echo 4th Gen	"I'm elated with this product. The sound quality is a remarkable improvement over the third generation ""dots."" However, after the first week of continuous use (I keep Alexa busy!), here are some things I noticed, all of which don't spoil my experience with this device.--The microphone to alert Alexa is near the base. So trying to make a request from above the device will not get a reply. This dot is placed by my bedside, but I've elevated it on two books, to make the microphone easily usable.--For those of us who are unable to use a hand-held device, we can't change the settings with any available app for computers--there apparently aren''t any--so we'll use this dot in ""default"" settings. So when I try to bring some music to a dot in one room (I have three third-generation dots besides this ""advanced"" dot), I get an offer by Alexa to switch the music from one device in another room, to the device I'm making the request from, but it never works--either Alexa turns the music off in the other room, or she's unable to turn it off, but nonetheless, I get no music from the dot I'm closest to! So I'm downgrading this to three dots--If the engineers can make an app for computers, I'll raise the rating accordingly."	3	January 14, 2021	1
242	Echo 4th Gen	Good sound quality	3	June 15, 2022	1
243	Echo 4th Gen	"Hi, my name is klaw. I am fine, how are you?I'm returning the echos i bought. They arrived not but an hour ago. Futility is the mantra when it comes to the set up and pairing of these two thingies. The end result is no device pairing and an hour of wasted time.  Time which probably would have been more enjoyably spent staring at the wall. Try wall staring if you have not!! It's much more enjoyable than trying to set up echos! lol. Imho, the echo is horrible.Please pass this feedback on to the manufacturer: ""The echo is a LAME, and intolerable device whose insolence should not be tolerated. It is a de-evolutionary system and therefore a total step back from previous versions. I am returning both echos i bought after an hour of futility spent attempting to set them up. You should abandon this version and give them away gratis to people who enjoy bad technology.""Note to potential  echo buyers out there: If you are into music and are desirous of a new system, do yourself a favor and buy yourself a sonos. Or multiple soni (sp?) I already have sonos and the set up is a breeze.  It's like uncorking a bottle and watching spellbound as Barbara Eden floats out. Truth.I was lured into trying this ""next gen"" echo because of the bargain basement pricing. There is a reason for this. An hour of my billable time is far more valuable than the price of the echo, and since I'm in the tech industry for a living, I don't need the aggravation of battling yet another system in my spare time.These speakers should deploy and set up almost ""automagically"" since they have the weighty support of Amazon's legions of engineers to back up the design. This is not the case. These speakers should bear a big red label reading ""Warning Lame Tech Inside. Proceed at your own risk. Perhaps you would be better off staring at the wall.""Thank you.This has been a public service announcement."	1	February 9, 2022	0
244	Echo 4th Gen	"They design a device to look aesthetically pleasing to the eye as it sits on your counter or table. And then they send your Charcoal or Twilight Blue device with a white power cord. Pretty unbelievable that they did not color match the cord, especially since it needs to remain plugged in 100% of the time. Really disappointed. Returning three of these tomorrow. Google Home, here I come.FOLLOW UP - So I got a quick call and email from Amazon. But their response was even more disappointing. Here's the email:Hello, My name is Christian and I’m from Amazon’s Technical Support team. I'm sorry to hear about the issue/s experienced with your 4th Gen Echo, which prompted you to leave a critical review on Amazon.com. I tried to reach you over the phone, but unfortunately we didn't connect.  I understand you're rather concerned about the aesthetics of the white power cord. This was an intentional decision that we made so that the power cord could more easily blend in with white background (think drywall, etc.). Since we'd still like to offer you some options, you're free to purchase a replacement power adapter in black at the link below (your model takes 30 watts): https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079S8K1RPWhat a load of crap - This ""think drywall"" rationale makes sense if you have drywall that is painted white, which I can tell you, no one in the northeastern United States has. Amazon made the decision to throw a white cord in every box to save money on the non-white devices and/or get people to shell out another $20 for the color cord that should have been in the box. Really disappointing from Amazon and really shortsighted.2ND UPDATE - So, Amazon dropped the price on these by $30.00. I bought three of them, so I decide to stick with the Alexas despite the cord issue on the black. I call to get a price adjustment. Nope, you have to return all three and buy three new ones. Clearly Amazon is hoping this will be an impediment to customers trying to get the lower price. I say, that makes no sense because Amazon is going to have to eat additional shipping plus reboxing. Sales rep tells me, they have to do it that way because there are only so many at the sales price. Another customer service line of crap. So, in theory, they are going to take my $100 Alexas, put them on the side and sell them only after the sale. Doubtful.Overall, good product for the money. But terrible job by Amazon."	1	November 18, 2020	0
245	Echo 4th Gen	I now have 3 of these. That's right, I didn't learn my lesson after the first one!As for the sound, it is good. The bass is deeper than my old echo and sounds a bit over processed, but it's fine. I can easily listen to music which is what I use the Echo for primarily.As for the microphone, like others have stated, it is horrible!!! My son has an Echo dot in his room. We had the Echo 2nd gen in our bedroom. There are times I will be standing next to the 4th gen slowly screaming at it. It will just spin, stop, spin, stop, and then play something totally incorrect. I will walk into my bedroom on the other side of the house and my 2nd gen will be doing exactly what I was trying to get this one to do! It does okay in totally silent rooms. As soon as there is any sound at all, good luck!	3	September 9, 2021	1
246	Echo 4th Gen	I’ve had an Echo Dot for a little over a year with little trouble. I recently upgraded to the Echo for the premium sound. After about a month I’m quite disappointed. Voice recognition is not nearly as accurate as the Dot. It comes on without a wake up more often than the Dot. Does not understand requests as accurately as the Dot and starts playing random music when asking it an unrelated question. I literally almost smashed it once because it WOULD NOT listen to anything I was asking, it would just say,”Ok, here’s music by____”.  The ONLY advantage of the Echo over the Dot is the sound is slightly better but not $50 better. Overall the Echo should not sell for more than $50-60.	3	December 3, 2021	1
247	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this for one reason only--to listen to music--specifically Amazon music.  You'd think that was a no brainer, I mean Amazon Echo, Amazon Music, what could go wrong?  I AirPlayed Amazon music for years through my Apple TV, until Apple dropped the Toslink connection from the 4K TV, making it impossible to play it directly through my receiver without having to turn on my TV.  Amazon has this on sale, so why not give it a try? 20 minutes--that's about all I can get from the echo before it decides to stop playing and I have to reboot the echo by unplugging and re-plugging the power cable.--I can't even get Alexa to reboot herself.  I bought a sound bar with HDMI passthrough and went back to Apple TV.  I guess if you want to have a conversation with Alexa, maybe this is the device for you.  C'mon Jeff, you guys can do better than this.	3	September 12, 2021	1
248	Echo 4th Gen	Still trying to program.	3	June 13, 2022	1
249	Echo 4th Gen	For some reason every so often it has a high pitched e buzz and I have to unplug it for a bit. Then I plug it back in and it’s fine for awhile	3	May 11, 2022	1
250	Echo 4th Gen	Impressive sound but Alexa has to be the absolute worst voice assistant out there. I subscribe to Amazon music but for some reason when I request songs from my library it either plays Iheart radio or I truly have to be excessively specific. Even then it's hit or miss. Great sound worst voice recognition on the market.	3	April 20, 2022	1
251	Echo 4th Gen	Delivery was slow especially when I could buy at Best Buy but couldn’t get a timely delivery from Amazon! Voice recognition is not the best.  You have to line up to the device and also be fairly close.  Sound is a little (tenny) sounding.  I think the sound is better on my original Echo  version1.	3	April 12, 2022	1
252	Echo 4th Gen	So after trying them all, I've decided to return both the new 4th Gen Alexa Dot, the bigger Alexa Echo (in red), and all the smart bulbs in white (boring). My 3rd Gen dots are fantastic, and they're plugged into Edifier speakers, so there's literally nothing new or better for me in the 4th Gen. (Except red spheres are mod and cool.)Plus the new ones, especially the dot, are hard of hearing. And the dot is twice as large (vertically) as it was before, so I'll keep the 3rd Gen one I keep in my suitcase for dog sitting stayovers too. And the 4th Gen don't seem to have good audio jacks, because my Edifiers only play out one speaker, but work fine with the same cable on my 3rd Gen Dot.I did however upgrade my mood lights in my room with RGB smart bulbs, so now I can go purple or whatever color I want. In theory, I could program them to change hue according to the temperature outside, or the price of corn.I also saw that there's a battery base for the 3rd Gen dot, so I'll try that out. Turns it into a portable smart Bluetooth speaker! Perfect for staying at somebody else's house.I'm only bummed because the red orb is so pretty.	3	November 25, 2020	1
253	Echo 4th Gen	Did they not test this product before mass production?? The sound is just overkill bass even when turn down bass in settings.  Have to repeat yourself several where maybe she will hear you then it's another thing of she hears you correctly. Very very disappointed. They majorly dropped the ball on this. The previous models were way better than this one as far as function and sound. Shame on the designers on this and on the people that approved this model. Buy gen 3 or wait and hope they do waaaaay better on gen 5. Which they should send out free to all the people that wasted their hard earned money on this model.	2	July 15, 2022	0
254	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa was having a hard time understanding me, and people could barely hear me using the communication functions, even if I was extremely close to the echo. Also, this is subjective, but I think the sound quality for music is not great. It has a lot of bass, and a lot of treble, but they don't mix together well. It seems like whenever a song gets to a part with with mostly higher frequencies, the bass just drops out, it's very distracting. I tried messing with the equalizer, but I never could get it to sound right. Not really a fan of the whole sphere thing either, but that's also subjective. I'm just sticking with echo dots from now on, they may be lacking in bass, but at least they have a cohesive sound, and a microphone that actually works.	2	June 15, 2022	0
255	Echo 4th Gen	I traded in my first generation Echo and Echo Plus for a fourth generation Echo in black and another one in white.  Like: The new model sounds better than both of my previous Echoes.  I sat them side by side and played a song with plenty of bass at the same volume level.  The new model was louder and produced deeper bass.  I prefer the sphere over the cylinder and the fabric cover over none at all.  The internal temperature sensor is a nice addition as is the Zigbee hub.Dislike: This latest version has A LOT of trouble hearing me even when I'm in the same room it's in and the room is quiet.  In fact, sometimes my third generation Echo Dot hears me despite it being in the adjacent room.  I frequently have to repeat myself or raise my voice before the new model hears me.  This was never the case with the devices I traded in.  I read somewhere the latest Echo has just 4 microphones instead of 7.  What a shame.  I really hope Amazon corrects this issue for the fifth generation Echo.  Finally, I hate that the black unit came with a white power cord.  They should match.	3	January 18, 2021	1
256	Echo 4th Gen	So I have 5 different echo devices in my house from several different generations of the device evolution.  This one by FAR under performs on voice recognition!  Looking at the history I can see that it recognizes the wake word but fails to understand the command.  All of the other echos in the house don’t have this problem.Other than that it’s fine for a speaker just like all the others.	2	August 20, 2022	0
257	Echo 4th Gen	Seriously, this is a lovely speaker. It sounds excellent. If you can get it to hear you, you’ll love the sound.We often have to prompt it, 3-5 times, while the echo dot and plus in the other room have no problem hearing us. Very frustrating…My wife wants me to get rid of it, but I really want to keep the sound quality and thermometer.	2	August 25, 2022	0
258	Echo 4th Gen	SHE WILL NOT SHUT UP! She has to  randomly scream and remind me what she is connected to. Why why why! This is when on silent mode. Sound is good and has more features Thant google mini but my mini is easier to use, better voice recognition, AND it keeps its mouth shut unless I want it to talk. Countless complaints about this and Amazon does nothing. Sound and deign are much nicer though. Too bad it doesn’t matter when I want to toss out my window	2	August 4, 2022	0
259	Echo 4th Gen	"I'm at the point where I have some variant of Echo in almost every room in the house, representing several generations of these products. I can say the sound is a big step up from the last generation Echo, but the microphones are a tremendous disappointment. Compared to the prior generation, it doesn't register my voice commands nearly as much and, when it does, it seems to have a higher error rate. I've tried to compensate by moving the device around or just rotating it at different angles, and the problems still exist. I'm seeing some similar comments in the reviews, so I have to conclude that Amazon just ""dropped the ball"" on this one (hilarious, I know.).Would not recommend. Instead spring for an Echo Studio (if you have the spot for a larger speaker) or an Echo Show 8 (if you don't mind the screen), as that model also has really nice sound but does not have the same microphone problems as this model. Or just wait until generation 5.EDIT: Amazon customer service (best in business, no doubt) called and tried to troubleshoot the device a bit. Doing a factory reset seemed to help slightly, but there is just no way this device hears me as well as previous generations or the other Echo iterations that I own."	3	November 22, 2020	1
260	Echo 4th Gen	"I replaced my old Pringles-can Echos with the new ball-style, and while they may look better and resist getting knocked over by my cat, they seem to have gotten worse at basic things like language comprehension. If I listen to the same 3 podcasts weekly, and I ask to hear the latest episode of one of those podcasts, how can Alexa constantly misunderstand and play some obscure podcast I've never heard before? Other times, I ask the Echo to do something basic like telling me the time, the blue light comes on for a second, but Alexa never says or does anything, not even ""Sorry, I didn't understand you."" The old Echos never did that.The real kicker, though, is the execrable ""by the way"" feature, which constantly asks me if I want to use some ability that I'm not interested in. I find myself actually getting mad and swearing at Alexa when she asks me if I want to try some inane, useless skill. If anyone at Amazon is actually listening to what I say to my Echo, then I apologize for my salty language. But if you continue to annoy me rather than assist me, then I'm going to move from swearing at my new Echos to throwing them in the trash and switching to Google's platform."	2	December 23, 2021	0
261	Echo 4th Gen	"I like the way it sounds. I really do. But the problem is, I can't even use it to listen to music at all. The problem traces back to very poor voice recognition.While you're playing music through the device, you may want to ask Alexa to control your home. But it can't hear you use the wake word at all. So I chose to have it connect to my old Creative Bluetooth speaker, which I have been using with Alexa since my old 2nd gen Echo dot from years ago. Sad really.But even with that Bluetooth speaker, the recognition of the wake word is so unstable. Sometimes I'm having a conversation on the phone or have the TV on (quite a bit of yards away at the opposite side of the room actually), it thinks it heard ""Alexa"", when really no one and nothing said it. I have no idea.Meanwhile, when I actually want to trigger it and I'm actually saying ""Alexa"", it's a hit or miss; either it won't react and I'll have to say it two or three more times, or it will actually work. It works about half the time. When it doesn't work, sometimes I have to scream ""Alexa"" louder and louder just to trigger the wake word. Sometimes it has to be so loud that my throat gets sore just from screaming the wake word.And in my experience, these frustrations I'm having are unique to this Echo 4th generation. I've also owned and used the Echo Dot 2nd Generation (which sounds awful on its own but see my comment about Bluetooth speaker above), and the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. Personally, I wish I just stuck with the Echo Dot 3rd Generation. At least that one only got mistriggered (is that a word? Lol) whenever there was an Alexa ad on the TV.Overall, if you already own an Alexa device, I highly recommend you stay away from this because it'll feel like a downgrade."	2	January 3, 2021	0
262	Echo 4th Gen	It would seem the only way to turn off ads is to cripple the device.  It's a shame, because otherwise this would be handy in my life.  As it is I find myself frustrated with it quite a bit.  It's like having a stranger chime up in my living room every once in a while about things they want to rip me off with.Great for timers, though that is very limited as well.I guess I would call the device 'smart lite'.  It reminds me of back when streaming was locked up by only a few companies and the interfaces really sucked.  At least that got a little better over the years, like skip options, etc. Alexa in it's current state feels crippled, crippled because Amazon can, not because it has to.As a device it's a single speaker so limited in it's application and basically a really expensive paper weight when the internet goes down or the amazon servers go down.	2	April 7, 2022	0
263	Echo 4th Gen	I love that I can bridge to my blinds but other than that I think it stinks. It fails to hear half my commands and gets them incorrect more often than not if it hears me. I have moved it out of my living room and returned my Echo Dot (3rd Gen) to the living room and put it in my least used location	3	March 23, 2022	1
264	Echo 4th Gen	Pros:- Buen sonido.- Excelente integración con Alexa.Cons:- Hace falta que tenga la mayoría de servicios de música disponible, principalmente YouTube Music.- El servicio de traducción la falta mejoría en comparación a Google.- Cuando se habilita el modo bilingue en inglés y español, hay ciertos lapsos que Alexa se confunde, debería estar preparada para cuando detecte inglés sólo conteste en dicho idioma, al igual en español. En alarmas, recordatorios...- Deben activar el modo Ad Guard para el resto de regiones, mi compra era principalmente para el uso de esa funcionalidad, y lamentablemente no está activo.	3	January 6, 2022	1
265	Echo 4th Gen	the speaker works sometimes it doesnt respond after it sits looking for supporting motion sensors still that are for outside that work with zigbee. support poor imo	3	May 11, 2022	1
266	Echo 4th Gen	Great but I bought this to replace a 3rd gen that died. However, 90% of the time. When playing music as part of a group with my existing 3rd gen, constantly fails to start playing or if it does, stops playing after a few songs.It's super frustrating to say the least. Have considered changing my 3rd gen out but seems ridiculous that it would have such trouble syncing a 4th gen with the 3rd gen.	3	February 19, 2022	1
267	Echo 4th Gen	The 3rd gen was amazing. Mic could hear and understand from basically anywhere in my apartment. The Mic on the 4 is constantly not even hearing me. The sound is still decent and deep, but no where close to where it was with the 3rd gen. I’m honestly ready to get rid of it completely as I get more out of a Bluetooth speaker at this point. It’s upsetting the Echo fell this far.	2	August 20, 2022	0
268	Echo 4th Gen	love the sound. Do not like the fact if you don't ask her a question within a certain amount of time,the music stops! When the music starts again,it is the same playlist. you need to mix up the playlists. Classic Rock,Hair Metal,80s rock,etc. always the same playlist. Need to mix it up.	3	April 18, 2022	1
269	Echo 4th Gen	I am hearing impaired so I use a Bluetooth link between my Echo and my TV. The speaker is placed near my hearing ear so I don't have to blast the internal TV speaker. But what I don't like - the echo rarely responds to voice queries. I ask a question and it will be answered by my echo show in another room, 40 feet away. Very very annoying.	3	March 5, 2022	1
270	Echo 4th Gen	The product turns itself on at 3:30 am not sure why !	3	May 28, 2022	1
271	Echo 4th Gen	I have owned pretty much every generation of echo dot. This time I wanted to upgrade to see if the sound is really better. And it is! This speaker is great for playing music. The mic to wake up and voice recognition is also great.There is one major flaw why I returned the item. If you set a volume loud enough to hear Alexa well it will blow you away when you play music. If you turn it down so the music is not waking up the neighbors it is simply too low to hear Alexa. The echo dot is way better balanced. I wish there was a volume setting for voice and music.	3	December 2, 2021	1
272	Echo 4th Gen	"I replaced a several year old cylinder style Echo with a new 4th gen (the old one died). This version is worse in pretty much every way. Specifically, the voice recognition is way worse. I frequently have to issue a command several times, with the key seeming to be artificially lowering my (male) voice, and making sure I leave a slight pause between ""alexa"" and the command. I was impressed with the previous Echo's recognition and came it rely on it for controlling lights and more. This version is often frustrating to use. I would not buy this again. A friend of mine has this same version and has the same problem.The sound quality is pretty subjective, but this version has more bass, but doesn't actually sound any better. Music is listenable, but still pretty poor--similar to before. I turned down the bass in the EQ to make it more balanced.The volume buttons are also worse than the old rotating control. The lights on the bottom are harder to see than the old ones on top (especially when changing volume and looking directly down). Aesthetically it looks OK, but ""stands out"" more and takes up more space, so the old style was more practical."	3	February 22, 2021	1
273	Echo 4th Gen	To start off, as an Echo it functions great like you would expect and others I have had before it.Unfortunately, It is very big and very ugly.  It is like a cloth looking ball.  Who wants that in your living room to see all the time.  The best was the 2nd gen, it is a short cylinder and I have the walnut dark brown version.  It looks good to have in a living room.  The 4th gen ball does not.  It won't even fit where I have my current one.  A very poor design decision.  Took off 2 starts for that.	3	December 6, 2021	1
274	Echo 4th Gen	"Don't get fooled by the ""Premium Sound"" designation and pay the extra $$.It's not worth it. The sound is muddy and dull. No real high frequencies and no real bass. It's all just a midrange blur. If you just looking for Echo functionality, save yourself some cash and get the regular version.And the setup is a  bungling mess. It keeps giving me error messages, while at the same time it does obey commands.I also wish it was weather-proof, but that's just a wish...Anyway, I'm not happy. It may have to go back..."	3	December 30, 2021	1
275	Echo 4th Gen	I upgraded from a 1st generation Echo to 4th generation to use the internal temperature sensor to control fans. The temperature control functionality is unuseful. It seems to require the temperature to cross the setpoint before triggering an action. For example, if the temperature setpoint is 75 degrees and its 76 degrees, the action will not trigger. It only triggers when the temperature drops below 75 degrees and then increases back to 76 degrees. This is useless logic for temperature controllers, but apparently a legacy problem. I rated two stars because this amounts to false advertising. Otherwise I have been using Echos for years and I am satisfied with most capabilities.I also tried integrating a Hubitat controller with Alexa to send a virtual switch. Unfortunately Alexa routine triggers are limited to schedule and temperature sensor. Alexa will not allow the virtual switch as a trigger.12/20/20 Update:Amazon tech support called me after reading this review. They suggested including all devices in the routine which didn't fix the issue. We also tried deleting and adding back the routine. We tried a schedule trigger instead of a temperature trigger which did work. Basically temperature routines don't work. Today I successfully paired an external zigbee temperature sensor. Temperature based routines still don't work.	3	December 15, 2020	1
276	Echo 4th Gen	"I got these a few years ago for surround sound for my tv. They worked ok for a month or so and would randomly disconnect so I stopped using them for that purpose and used them for multi room sound. It was fine for a while and they would disconnect occasionally but now they won't connect at all. I spent 2 hours trying to fix the issue myself before contacting support then nearly 2 more hours with support and still no resolution. They said they would contact me in 5-7 business days so who knows...My other issues with the devices are that they never seem to understand anything I say. I had the old echo dots and had very few issues with them understanding me. One would assume the newer more expensive devices would work better, right? with these I commonly get the response ""I'm sorry, I didn't get that"" or ""something went wrong."" My favorite was when I asked to turn the lights down and Alexa played me the song Mr Grinch. When I ask to adjust the thermostat she will either play some random song or tell me that I'm 2.2 miles from the city I live in. Other voice commands give equally random results.Also, one of my devices started reporting the room temperature in °C instead of °F out of the blue one day. If I asked for the outside temp or the other rooms temp, it would respond in °F, but the room I was in was °C. I spent 2 hours with support resetting the device, adjusting settings and restarting the router before giving up and swapping that device for one in another room.If you want a device that doesn't do what it's advertised to do and does do random stuff when you ask for something, then this is the device for you."	2	January 8, 2021	0
277	Echo 4th Gen	Sound quality not good.  Very, very bass heavy.  Cannot adjust treble to compensate	3	May 24, 2022	1
278	Echo 4th Gen	I was hoping the sound would have the highs and lows of a premium speaker. Unfortunately, there is plenty of lows with a powerful base sounds but not much on the highs provided by the tweeters.  Also, despite the fact that I have single use music unlimited, it doesn’t recognize consistently provided this unlimited music subscription on the speaker, despite the fact it’s the only speaker in use, I also have a dot and show.l. Overall, if your looking for an Alexa driven speaker with premium sound.  This isn’t the one unless you just are listening the music lows.	3	December 24, 2021	1
279	Echo 4th Gen	"It seems like years ago the ""announcement"" feature would work as good as it used to. (We use this often in our household to talk to each other.)  We will say announce and it will not hear us sometimes but usually we will say ""Alexa, Announce, The book is on the shelf ready for pickup"" and Alexa will announce ""The book"" or ""The book is"". Also the audio quality is not as good I feel like as even when we do get our full statement across the quality is bad and we cannot hear it.  Maybe the developers are compressing the audio to much???"	3	December 11, 2021	1
280	Echo 4th Gen	So I mainly use mine as an alarm clock and for music. The software used to work seamlessly with my iPhone and PC with my third gen alexa. This one is more janky sometimes annoying to get it to play what I want it too. For alarm purposes works perfectly just kinda upset that I upgraded and got something worse. Plus whit power cable is kinda ugly. It looks and feels cheap.	3	February 21, 2022	1
281	Echo 4th Gen	It seems as though this Echo has a harder time understanding than our others and the audio isn’t much better than the cheaper models.	3	May 11, 2022	1
282	Echo 4th Gen	My hope was to have sound that wouldreplace my radio. It would be perfect with a better audio. My expectations influenced my rating.	3	May 8, 2022	1
283	Echo 4th Gen	"The app is clunky. If you have a ""household"" prepare for a nightmare when you want to set up audio by room or everywhere if not everyone lives in the same house despite different accounts.Devices don't connect simultaneously (i.e. turn lights on) and audio splitting is laggy. Connects to my phone, but doesn't always make calls from it when I ask-- its capable, its done it, it just doesn't ALWAYS do it even with an exact command.Can't get it to connect to my Bluetooth stereo, won't connect to my tvs even though it can find them. Can't always control my firesticks and she says they don't exist under voice command but can control from app.Other than that-- the device itself has excellent audio quality-- I'm picking it over my 5.1 stereo half the time. Blueprints are dope for getting her to say whatever I want as long as I can figure out a proper phonetic spelling. Its a cool gadget, just doesn't deliver all as promised.I have a lot of hair ripping moments, and a lot of future is now moments with this device. I see the potential, its just taking a lot more tweaking and tech know-how than I expected."	3	December 13, 2020	1
284	Echo 4th Gen	Device quality great, but Alexa not so much with too many unwanted commercials.	3	May 22, 2022	1
285	Echo 4th Gen	I have this Alexa device in my room and I keep the first version in my restroom. Let me tell you that the quality of sound is good but every time I call for ‘Alexa’ it doesn’t listen. And it can be next to me and it won’t listen to my commands. The 1st generation Mini echo can listen to me and I don’t have to be repeating myself, cost me $15 3 years ago and it still is better quality than this brand new one, it’s disappointing.	3	January 7, 2022	1
286	Echo 4th Gen	Don’t pay $99 for this speaker you can find this for $60 at many retailer’s. It is better than the previous version but not by much. The design is nice like a ball 👍 unfortunately two weeks after I got this I picked up the Belkin SOUNDFORM™ elite Alexa speaker so unfortunately this one was retired to the garage lol. My recommendation for the next generation of Alexa would be to have a charging dock or cradle to the next design or at least a USB out. My recommendation🙏	3	January 5, 2022	1
287	Echo 4th Gen	FOR ONE IT DOES'NT DO MUCH OF ANYTHING THAT SAVE TIMES AND IS REALY USEFULL, UNLESS YOU SPEND MORE MONEY BUYING OUTLETS SWITCH FOR EVERY LITTLE THINGS you want it to INTERACTS WITH ITS NOT ALL BAD BUT ITS FAR FROM BEING A GLORYFIED ATIFICAL INTEL BUT NOT REALLY FUNCTIONAL AND USERS FRIENDLY WHERE YOU WOULD THINK OF A COMPLETE SET SMART LIKE SYSTEM WHERE WE END UP SPENDING MORE MONEY FOR GETING LESS. BECAUSE ALONE Alexa is basically an incomplete clock ball IN NEED OF A SERIOUE MAKE OVER	2	July 16, 2022	0
288	Echo 4th Gen	1-year update and I have to say that this product is very inconsistent.  I mostly use this for listening to music.  Some days it will play perfect for hours.  Then the next day I can't get it to play a whole song without cutting out.  Unplug, restart, and it does it more.  Then Alexa doesn't respond correctly to audio commands.  I'm just about done with this junk.  It's an audio speaker and it can barely do that on it's best day.  Pair the subwoofer with it and multiply your headaches!!!  Sometimes it works, other times it don't... and then on the rare occasion, the SUBWOOFER will play music when the speaker won't.  VERY annoying!!!	1	October 24, 2022	0
289	Echo 4th Gen	"I had essentially the same problems with the prior generation full sized echo with hub, and decided to return it for a refund.  I've had this unit for more than 6 months, but just now getting tired of it's deficiencies and decided to write a review. First off, the smart hub features seem to work fine. My issues are with voice recognition and audio quality. It's pretty crappy.I have a same generation Echo Dot across the room. Often if I'm standing immediately next to this larger Echo hub and say something to it, it doesn't respond, but the one 20 feet away across the room does. Sometimes I can make 2 back-to-back requests, standing next to the unit with my mouth facing it, and with the same voice volume - one of the requests will be answered by it and the other will be answered from the unit 20 feet away.I do not believe it is simply ""confusion"" between the two units.  Before I had the Dot, I would have experienced the hub unit simply not responding to my voice at all.Audio quality is terrible - I have a house full of Echo's including a 1st generation Echo.  It is very muffled, like if you turned up bass to the max, and treble to the min. It's almost as if it simply doesn't produce ANY high frequencies.  My same generation Echo dot, and 1st generation Echo sound FAR better. My Dot w/clock sounds fine.  but this unit, just like the prior edition hub sound like they are under a pillow.  and yes, I have adjusted bass down and treble up...tiny bit of improvement but it still sucks."	2	April 21, 2021	0
290	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this specifically to get a certain radio station in our living room as the 1990s receiver no longer works for radio. This was far cheaper than replacing the receiver. It frequently misunderstands my commands. It knows my voice, but does really weird things instead of what I want. It isn't terrible, but it is just okay. I can get my radio station. I have used it for some reminders. I suppose it is learning and I am also.	3	January 22, 2022	1
291	Echo 4th Gen	We bought the echo about 6 months ago.  We were impressed with the sound quality of the echo, the depth of sound is pretty good.However!  The quality of the sound is moot when you can’t get the device to actually play music.  This is the most glitchy device I have ever purchased.  We’ve had issues from the beginning.  I would have to reconnect it to the wifi almost daily, sometimes restarting my router just to get the stupid thing to reconnect, even though every other device in the home was connected.Ok, maybe there was something wrong with the signal of our router, so we purchased google routers and placed them all over our house to broadcast the signal better.  I guess that worked because we haven’t had Alexa tell us she’s not connected to the internet anymore.  But NOW she just won’t play music whenever she doesn’t feel like doing it.  In order to get the echo play music nowadays we have to unplug it for a minute and then plug it back in and that will last for a while. If we have music playing in the background for a couple of hours, you can tell when it needs to be unplugged and plugged back in because it will just decide to stop playing music for no reason.Would have returned it right away and given it one star if the sound quality was garbage.  But my husband is willing to put up with it because while it’s working, after all the screwballing around to get it to work, it sounds great.	2	May 24, 2021	0
292	Echo 4th Gen	First off, I’m still a bit upset my first Echo plus ironically went out a couple weeks after the warranty expired. I am not a fan of the bigger footprint and round ball design. I liked the cylindrical design way better as it had a smaller footprint. The ugly white cord is way too short so you’ll probably need an extension cord depending on if and where your going to mount it. As other reviewers say, it does have a problem hearing it’s “wake up” name here and there but not often enough to annoy us yet. The sound is a bit better than my old unit but we don’t use it for music. Overall its ok, if you need a hub it’s probably the cheapest way to go.	3	October 1, 2021	1
293	Echo 4th Gen	"I've had these devices for years, I am now constantly saying ""Alexa, shut up!"" as she blabs on with her ""by the way..."" suggestions. There is no way to shut this off.Automation is constantly adding duplicate devices, integrations with devices like Treatlife do not add the devices and it confuses the names of devices responding with things like ""...there is no device named potato light""I had hoped that this device with smart device support would fix issues, but it did not, and has no display. The do not make an echo with smart device support with a display (except the show echos)"	2	June 24, 2022	0
294	Echo 4th Gen	Has all of a sudden started making this horrible static noise when I'm listening to music or radio, etc.  Gets so bad I have to turn off!	3	April 29, 2022	1
295	Echo 4th Gen	I really love the good bass sound from this device. Alexa is great. Added Amazon Music Unlimited so music listening is great. Also love the ability to receive calls from other Echo users or people using their mobile phones, and likewise to call other Echo devices and mobile phones. The major drawback with this product is that the music volumes aren't normalized between songs. The volume can drastically change between songs. This is a major flaw.  It isn't a good music listening experience.	3	January 7, 2022	1
296	Echo 4th Gen	I have 3 alexas. My 3d generation picks up better in another room that this one does. I bought the better of this stile and very disapointed. They put in a bigger speaker and took away from other part insted of making a kick ass unit. I guess that is big corp. They saved 25cents and lost a customer. Good job I say. Now the thing is not playing right. I got it 9 months ago. Maybe the gen 3s where working to good so they made it to break down. I am going to prob buy a google one and give this one away. If I can get it working. I it sucks because I really like alexa and my gen 3 is a bad ass unit. It might have  been just to good.	3	September 11, 2021	1
297	Echo 4th Gen	The hub is supposed to allow light control when internet is out or resetting. It does not, all other devices are connected to the Echo 4th gen hub, the lights are, but if internet  is out all i get is there is no internet and all the fricken lights stay on. IF power goes out ALL lights ocme on an i cant voice control until router connects to internet that main is connected too.I was lied to that it would work with the specific bulbs when the internet is disconnected. Does not work same as the old echo plus.	3	November 23, 2021	1
298	Echo 4th Gen	But if you whisper from the toilet in another room she responds.  Totally crazy.  I’m getting to the point where I’m going to throw this one away or maybe use it as an extra speaker for more sound and out my original Alexa back up because she listens when you tell her things.	2	August 17, 2022	0
299	Echo 4th Gen	This was a gift. Set up was fairly easy. This could be a very useful tool-unfortunately, it does not integrate with my TCL Smart TV although it is supposed to. In fact, it doesn’t help with any of my electronic or electrical devices, lights, etc because mine are “standard” and not “Alexa-type”. So unless I invest quite a bit of money and alter what’s in place- This Echo is very restrictive in what it can do for me.	3	January 13, 2022	1
300	Echo 4th Gen	Often feel like l'm talking to a rebellious child, as it doesn't seem to listen well.  Ask it how many songs are in your current play list & it sends you to some weird alt rock Amazon station.	3	April 9, 2022	1
301	Echo 4th Gen	The older styles were much better as they emitted sound from all directions. You really need to be directly in front of this one to get the best sound quality which is a big letdown and change from prior models.	3	March 28, 2022	1
302	Echo 4th Gen	If you are fully ingrained in the Amazon eco system, then maybe you'll enjoy this product, but you'd be better off just buying a higher quality Bluetooth speaker (that's portable) for the same price.It was given to me as a present and has been nothing but a pain. First it wouldn't activate, support said it had been returned and that I needed to purchase it in order to get it to work. After some annoying back and forth followed by me calling it quits and asking to return it, they finally activated it so I wouldn't hurt their bottom line. Added sportify, started playing some music, and was meh about it. They replace quality sound with an obnoxiously plastic sounding big thumping bass that drowns out the mids and highs even when turned all the way down.Went to use the speaker for a second time, and it will no longer connect to my Spotify, but will still play music/audio books through any of Amazon's services(hmmmm.....). Did all of the troubleshooting steps recommended by support, and still no luck.Not worth the money or hassle.	2	January 12, 2022	0
303	Echo 4th Gen	The new Alexa is cumbersome to move around. You really can't hold it comfortably in one hand. The sound is somewhat improved , the quality of the sound is often the quality of the location the sound is heard in. I listen in my home or on the deck. So to compare it to the old one is tough. I can notice the bass a little more. The sound quality of the old Alexa was very good. Moving Alexa from point A to point B is a pain. Certainly there was a need to tweak the old Alexa. But to completely reconfigure/redesign the whole thing then require a base attachment for portability is perplexing. I love my Alexa and the music she brings into my life. It's too bad it's gotten more cumbersome for me to enjoy my music.	3	August 27, 2021	1
304	Echo 4th Gen	I bought a Google Nest Hub Max at the same time, and noticed the following:Sound quality: The Echo has better sound quality.Voice recognition: Google Nest Hub Max voice recognition is far superior, I often have to shout for the Echo to acknowledge my voice, even at short distances.Usability: Google Nest Hub Max is sooo much easier to use since it doesn't have all the regional restrictions that the Echo has, I can't even download the Alexa app in HK and had to use a VPN. Then even with the app set up, most of the skills don't work on the Echo with no explanation given, including flash briefings (I can only get the weather on the Echo, but can get the full list when using the Alexa app). Tech support was completely unhelpful. And even if I set Spotify as the default music provider, it almost always plays music from Amazon Music instead.I guess users in the US may have a better experience, but due to compatibility issues here in HK I can just about use it for playing music. Conclusion: Just buy the Google Nest to save yourself some grief.	3	December 24, 2020	1
305	Echo 4th Gen	"I recently bought a Muse headband with an app that I connect to my Amazon Echo. When the headband detects I've woken up in the middle of the night, it connects to BT and starts play sleep sounds to get me back to sleep. Unfortunately, every time the Echo connects to BT it announces very loudly ""Connected to iPhone!"" which startles me. I've done research and there have been complaints since 2016 of this but Amazon is not listening to their customers. There is no way to change it. Even if announcements are set to off and brief mode is on.Unfortunately, that meant I have to return and get a Google Nest Audio, which meant if I really want to use the Muse headband I have to switch my smart home to Google. All I can say is if you want some peace with the BT feature on a smart speaker, get the Google Nest Audio. It's much better. It will play a soft connection sound. It's a hassle changing everything but makes a world of difference, and I am now happy overall with a company that pays attention to its customers."	2	December 30, 2021	0
306	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this to replace my 3rd gen echo dot for improved sound quality.  The sound is better than the dot it replaced so I'm pretty happy with that aspect.  Compared to both the 3rd and 4th gen echo dots I own, the microphone does not seem to work as well.  I never had as much trouble with the 3rd gen that this replaced in exactly the same spot and conditions.It also refuses to change the volume about 50% of the time by voice command.  Every other night I have to change volume by hand or in the app because it just won't. I wouldn't buy this again from the frustration with the failed volume control and poor mic.  Eventually I'll get fed up enough to replace it and it probably won't be with an Amazon product.	3	August 20, 2021	1
307	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this as a gift for my mom.  She keeps having to unplug it because it just randomly starts making a loud static noise.  Has anyone else had this issue??	2	September 18, 2022	0
308	Echo 4th Gen	I traded in my 1st generation Echo for the new 4th generation sphere one, thinking that things would have improved over a couple of years. In two key ways, they have not.1. Mics are less effective.The mics are actually worse at picking up my voice. I find myself repeating the wake word more often, and at a louder volume, just to get the same result. The old cylinder was pretty omni-directional; they new one less so.2. The sound is overly bassy.Yes, you can adjust the bass through the app to tone it down, but you shouldn't have to. I don't have the old and new side by side, so it's hard to judge which sounds better overall, but at least on the default bass setting the new one seems less accurate.What do I like better on the new one? It's shorter, so it doesn't stick out as much on the kitchen island where it lives. You can judge for yourself whether the new esthetic is better, but the design change was not the reason I purchased the new one - I thought the mics and sound would be better, and I'm disappointed.	3	December 22, 2020	1
309	Echo 4th Gen	"This item was got through Amazon and was ""pre set"" for me.  It did not work properly with no microphone. After a walk through where I had to re set it myself, it worked, but he microphone became less and less responsive over the months that I continued to make payments. As soon as it was paid off, the microphone stopped responding to most commands.  Music playing in groups gets disrupted and stopped due to this device, while when unplugged, I get good music.  Customer service told me online that it will simply be replaced, since it is within warantee, and to follow instructions to send the bad one back.  After that communication, I was told differently online that it is a REPAIR request, that they are not honoring the warantee replacement, and that I have to send the item to Amaaon via UPS, have their technicans take it apart and analize it, then send it back to me.  So one customer service tells me that the new one is ordered and will be here in 3-5 business days, another tells me that I will get nothing until they get the broken one and fix it then send it back, and now I am on perpetual hold because the phone operators are too busy goofing off to actually provide any kind of completent assistance."	1	June 17, 2022	0

312	Echo 4th Gen	First impression: why on earth would Amazon pair a white power cord to a black speaker?? At the very least, give customers a cord color option; for me, my intended placement was a black granite counter btwn my kitchen and family rm, so no opportunity to conceal. Why should I have to pay $20-30 extra for a color-matched cord? Never has been an issue for past Echo devices, of which I have MANY... 14 I thinkSecond: I've grown fond of the cylinder shape, not a fan of this spherical shape; it might make sense if the sound was not front-firing, but sadly is. I could grow accustomed to that if not for the white cord, which Hubby said he could paint, but why should that even need to be a consideration? Besides, my plan was to add a 2nd one as well and, if they failed, alterations would negate the ability to returnLastly: I have 2 charcoal Gen 3 Echos on that same counter; they have black cords, sound really grea! and look great. The last straw was that the sound quality from this 4th Gen was underwhelming; if it was supposed to be a big improvement over the Gen 3s, they definitely missed the mark and it's surely not worth the sacrifices I'd make in appearance. ReturningP.S. To the engineers, please take note! It doesn't matter how much you improve the sound quality - if you also degrade the appearance exponentially it's NOT going in my house. I doubt I'm alone on this...	2	June 22, 2021	0
313	Echo 4th Gen	I was excited about this new Echo.  I was especially excited to be able to trade in my old model to this new one.  The sound is great BUT it doesn't recognize my husbands voice AT ALL.  Also we had a routine and I tried to recreate it for the new one.  It won't recognize the routine.  It took me 2 hours to figure out how to set up a routine.  I tried to get support but it continues to get me to on-line stuff and you cannot talk to anyone.  I wish I had never upgraded.  If I could go back I would.UPDATE:An amazon representative called me and the young man was so very nice.  He helped me resolve the issues above quite easily. Sent a long detailed email on what to do.  I now will say that I would purchase again.  I upgraded the review to a 3 and switched between a 3 & a 4 but settled on a 3 because it was a struggle to get to this point.  I would Recommend this dot.Thanks Sarah	3	January 4, 2021	1
314	Echo 4th Gen	"This is a stylish unit, but that may be the cause for concern.  I have all the generations of Echo units in operation currently, and this one really comes up short on voice recognition.  The older units can be triggered from 20+ feet away, which is really helpful when turning on lights, for example, as you are entering a dark room.  This unit has trouble beyond 5 feet.Sound quality is on par with the 3rd gen unit.The light ring at the bottom is also not optimal, as it is not as easily noticed from a distance.I truly believe this generation was an effort in value engineering.  It just feels ""Cheaper"" that it's older sibling.  Part of this is the removal of the volume adjustment via the top ring.One more note, the control buttons are right on the fabric, so grimy hands will stain the speaker mesh over time.  This unit also needs to be dusted with a vacuum or canned air, as it cannot be wiped off on top due to the fabric cover."	3	February 4, 2021	1
315	Echo 4th Gen	I wanted a major competitor's version of this, but because that one didn't even offer Bluetooth and was about 230 more...so, after hearing an Echo (I think the one I heard was from earlier 2019..it was tall), I decided to buy one.  Firstly, though the sound is mediocre for its price point, it does not sound as great as the early 2019 one I heard.  This one sounds ok in a large bedroom, but fails miserably in a smaller bedroom (my craft room). There, it, literally, sounds like what it is...a small basic Bluetooth speaker.  Very treble!  I turned it off an connected my iPad back up to the Bluetooth stereo system instead.  I am going to keep it as it does integrate SiriusXM amongst others, but it will remain in the larger bedroom.  Setup was not terribly fun.  My daughter has a dot (those sound worse than this one) and anytime I told Alexa to do something, it went on HER echo...even though we were on opposite ends of the house.  I think this is made more to be used as a system throughout the house versus a more individual toy. I think I got it sorted out now, but there are still issues. It doesn't always respond and it does go out.  I've read it's a WiFi issue, but nothing else goes out when the echo goes out.  My daughter loves hers (she's 16), but she's addicted to music subscription services.  Would I buy it if I had to again?  Probably not.  I'm not too much into this smarthome  technology.  I'm more into sound quality...if the competitor's had Bluetooth, it'd be sitting here instead of the Echo.	2	December 24, 2020	0
316	Echo 4th Gen	I bought the first echo device and loved it. I have purchase many echo dots since then (8-10). Our family loves them all. This fourth generation echo is subpar at best in my opinion.I have owned it for about a year now and the device does not respond as well as the dots. I wish I would have returned it when purchased because it does not function well as an Alexa Assistant.We are constantly having to repeat ourselves when sitting right beside the device. It often does not complete the requested task when it does hear us. It’s ability to listen and respond is far inferior to all the other echo dots we have (1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generation).The sound quality is good but that is not a significant selling point for me personally. I wanted Alexa to work well on a device with sound better/louder than the dot. That isn’t a high bar for sound quality since the dots are small. So, it meets my needs for sound quality but my bar is set low in that area.It does not meet my needs as an Alexa assistant in our main room of the house.	2	November 25, 2021	0
317	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this mainly to improve sound quality from the small tv in my kitchen after being disappointed with the Echo Studio. The dot was slightly better at connecting to my firestick 4k than the echo studio was, but not much. I frequently had to turn everything off then back on or fiddle with settings.I honestly didn’t notice a big difference between the echo premium and a standard echo. I’m sure there’s a more significant difference in sound quality at loud volumes but it was not worth it for me, as someone who takes it seriously when someone claims the audio output as a selling point.I eventually returned it for a standard echo 4th Gen and a $60 refurbished Sony sound bar. The sound quality is sooooo much better and the price difference was negligible after sales.	3	August 13, 2021	1
318	Echo 4th Gen	"""Alexa, play Spotify"" - yeah right. This skill seldom works and you have to constantly re-authorize your Spotify account and use the Alexa app to start it up. This is why the Spotify skill has 12,000+ reviews and only 2 stars. Why is this? Platform inoperability, which is as old as the tech industry itself. What it means is that developers have a positive disincentive to make their product work with a competitor's product. Is it hard left to make Spotify work on this device? Probably not. Do Amazon or Spotify want it to work? Definitely not, and that is how we end up here."	3	October 26, 2021	1
319	Echo 4th Gen	trato de hacer sonar todos mis dispositivos al tiempo, pero no se porque el bendito aparato se conecta a otra red que tengo configurada, pero lo saco de ahí, lo coloco en la red que quiero y cuando trato de hacer sonar todos los aparatos al tiempo cambia de red, creo que hay una oportunidad para mejora, que independiente de las redes, si mi aparato esta configurado con mi ID de Amazon, sin importar la red, deberían todos sonar al tiempo, ya otra cosa es que Spotify por ejemplo, lo permita, pero eso también tiene solución.Con respecto al sonido, cuando se combinan este con el echo dos de 4th generación, suenan espectacular, el primero tiene un bajo aceptable que el otro no tiene, pero el segundo tiene un brillo que el otro no tiene, lo que me parece raro porque se supone que tiene dos twiters (o como se escriba).Le diera 5 estrellas si no fuera por ese detalle que escoge entre dos redes disponibles, me imagino que buscando ofrecer la mejor calidad de comunicación, sin embargo, me niega la posibilidad multiroom, a mejorar eso Amazon Team.	3	December 27, 2020	1
320	Echo 4th Gen	I ordered a black echo to place in my kitchen. The device works well, and the set up is easy. However, it comes standard with a white cord now, which is not disclosed when you place the order.  It looks ridiculous, and it appears like a mismatched cord with another device.  If you order red - you get a white cord.  Grey - white cord.  Blue - white cord...  After working with Amazon customer support, I was told to order a new black cord and pay for it, and they would let me then request a refund on the matching cord.  What??!!  Anyway, the device is fine, and I would give a five-star review to the device otherwise.	3	September 8, 2021	1
321	Echo 4th Gen	"I am a huge fan of Amazon's products and I love how I was able to integrate Alexa with my firestick, smart switches and lamps, or just use it as a Bluetooth device.But -1. Auto Bluetooth Connect - Alexa announces whenever a bluetooth device is connected. You dont have any control over that to disable Auto-Connect. You might be listening to music on your phone and then you powerup your laptop and it will connect to your laptop and switches back and forth sometimes. The only solution Amazon has given, is to Forget your device from bluetooth settings EACH time you are done using it.2. Announcements! - I tried disabling this but Alexa wont stop announcing every time I connect a device to Alexa and its so loud. Sometimes Alexa randomly connects to my phone in the *middle of the night* (because there may be a notification on my phone).It goes like ""NOW CONNECTED TO REDMI NOTE PRO""! at 3 AM!!!"	2	February 1, 2022	0
322	Echo 4th Gen	I have 1st and 2nd Gen Echos all over my house.  This is my first 4th gen and I am disappointed.  The sound is much better than my 2nd gen echos but it does not wake up very easily at all.  I can be standing 6 feet in front of it and say Alexa and my 2nd gen 20 feet away in my family room will wake up and still nothing from the 4th gen.  Tech support had me do a hard reset with no improvement and offered to send me a refurb for my brand new echo.  No thanks, I will just return itUpdate:  After my previous review, a rep from Amazon contacted me and was very helpful.  He was able to push an update through that fixed my echo and made it much more responsive.2nd Update:  After using the updated echo for a few days it was not more responsive.  Amazon sent me a new echo to replace this one and it is exactly the same.  The echo just doesn't hear your voice to Wake Up	3	January 12, 2021	1
323	Echo 4th Gen	The Echo device has good sound quality and mostly good voice recognition.  It does not play well with streaming Sirius XM though that is one of its capabilities.  The Alexa app can be a tangled mess at times making it difficult to navigate to the desired function to control Echo.  This last issue easily detracts at least one full star from the rating.	3	January 17, 2022	1
324	Echo 4th Gen	"I've been a fan of the Echo since its inception.  In fact I've had each of the 4 generations (including this one).  I wish I had stayed with the 3rd Gen.  Alexa seems to be getting old, her hearing isn't what it used to be.  I find I have to repeat ""Alexa"" on several occasions for her to respond, as well as repeating requests.  I listen to Amazon Music, and it sounds a little muffled at times.  Not sure if I just have a poor unit or if these points need to be addressed in the next generation."	3	October 22, 2021	1
325	Echo 4th Gen	"We have two hubs and a dot. The one that *I* actually bought is the only one that doesn't work right. Or - sometimes it does. It's just that sometimes it doesn't. It hears ""Alexa"" but frequently ignores whatever I say after that - as if I'd said nothing at all. It *should* tell you it doesn't understand what you said, but it just acts like it heard nothing. The other two echos are fine, though. Just bad luck"	3	December 18, 2021	1
326	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is rather good. The bass is heavy, which is good for some music, but not videos. I do feel that I have to yell the command name for it to hear me. This is odd as my first gen echo dot will hear me whisper it's name. I have tested them in the same spot and this device does not recognize as well as previous models. It does not tether to older alexas ( not a minus just extra information). Another thing I have noticed, is that when bluetooth paired with a fire stick; apps like hulu and Netflix seem to crash.This was bought for me as a gift and the pictures are somewhat misleading as they do not show a cord in many of them. This lead to the belief that it had an internal battery that allowed it to be moved between rooms. (Which would have been a great selling point). This device does not have an internal battery. In fact the charge cable it comes with is short, so keep that in mind when thinking about where you wish to place it. I have a first gen alexa and the cable that came with it is longer.A note for Amazon, when this device was first advertised, it showd a globe pattern. When I saw that, I wanted this device. I was disappointed that there was no actual globe/map print available. I feel that whoever designed that add had a great idea that was never produced into reality. To add on, it would have been nice to have the clock face added to this as well.	2	January 3, 2021	0
327	Echo 4th Gen	Excellent sound quality. While the volume is easily adjustable, there is no need to turn the volume to max in order to hear music or an audio book.However, there is a hearing problem. I have to repeat myself several times and end up shouting at the Echo when I want to be heard.	3	February 7, 2022	1
328	Echo 4th Gen	I have to reboot this thing every other day - you say something it lights up but no response. 😞	3	April 26, 2022	1
329	Echo 4th Gen	I have had Echos since the original beta group back in 2014. I still have and use my Gen 1 every day. I currently have 9 of them including Echo Autos, 4 dots, and an Echo Flex. I purchased this 4th gen to replace the 1st gen that I use as the main Echo in my living room. The 1st gen is still working great, but it's not compatible with some of the new Alexa features.We got it last year on black Friday. It would respond to commands OK for a few hours. After that, it would stop responding entirely. You could manually wake it with the button, but it would not hear you at all. A power reset would fix it, for a few hours or a day and then it would happen all over again. After dealing with Amazon, they sent a replacement. The replacement had the same issue. Even when it did work, you had to speak very loud and close. The Echo dots on the other side of the house would respond instead of this one 3 feet away.The Echo was placed in the same location as the one it replaced, on the same network.After going through 2 units, we figured there was some sort of known issue. We returned the second unit and went back to our 1st gen. A year later (hoping that the issues have been worked out), we purchased another unit. Guess what? New unit has the same exact issue.Search Google for Echo 4th gen microphone issues and you will see this happens to a lot of people. Even when they do worth, they don't work nearly as good as previous generations. Which is a shame.For now, this one is going back again and we will continue to use our 1st gen until Amazon can get it together.	1	December 1, 2021	0
330	Echo 4th Gen	This was my fifth Alexa Echo products that I've purchased. I don't know what it is about the new design, but now it seems to never hear me say the wake up word. I feel like I have to shout Alexa just to get her to light up, so I know she's listening. I'm also super frustrated that podcast can't be fast-forwarded to specific time within the podcast. I use this feature all the time when Alexa plays an audible book, so why can't it be used for podcast as well? I also feel like this most recent iteration of the echo doesn't understand what I'm asking, even though I can  use a similar phrase for my studio Echo and I'll be understood. I tried to buy an adapter to put it on the wall cuz I hate how much space it takes on surfaces, and of course I ended up with a dot wall adapter for the echo instead of this size. I just wish they would call it a different name or a different induration or something to make it identifiable without me having to feel like an expert at the dimensions of each of the objects. I found it really irritating that the cord for the power had been shortened almost a foot, and I couldn't put this new echo in the same location as my old Echo because they switch the power integration port to an AUX port instead of whatever it was before. I still love my studio Echo, but overall I'm super disappointed in this product.	2	April 13, 2021	0
331	Echo 4th Gen	"All of the 4th Gen Echos are Amazon's greatest failure. The 3rd Gens are great, they hear you every time. they stay connected to the internet, they do what they're made to do every singe time.--The 4th Gens do the exact opposite, from day one all of the 4th Gen ones I have purchased have done nothing but fail to do what they are made to do. They have better speakers, and this big one has added a temperature sensor, which is truly a game changer for routines, allowing Alexa to monitor the temperature of a room and adjust accordingly on her own. Howver she NEVER hears me say her name the first time, 80% of the time once she does, she will not hear the command I give her. How is an Echo supposed to work if it cannot understand its user. That is literally the ONLY thing these things need to do--well that and stay connected to the internet. there is a 50/50 shot that when I say her name, she gives me the ""the intertnet isnt accessible"" line. When it Very much is. every other device I have connects and stays connected just fine. It is only the 4th Gen echos that have so much trouble staying connected.  The temperature sensor is the only real thing worth even trying to buy one of these, but its hugely unreliable at best, and sadly no other temperature sensor can initiate a routine based on the rooms degree yet. -----Do not waste your money on the 4th gen, buy a 3rd gen or wait for the 5thand Amazon, do NOT call me this time. The last time I left a negative review on an echo device (the 4th gen dot) you called me. --I appreciate the gesture, amazing customer support, one of the reasons I love amazon. but this is not a user error, I do IT for a living, this is not failure to set up properly, this is device malfunction."	1	August 18, 2021	0
332	Echo 4th Gen	I enjoy using echo devices but the echo fourth generation device has much difficulty calibrating the temperature sensor. I recently purchased two fourth generation devices and one finally calibrated the temperature sensor after MANY register/deregister exercises. After 48 hours the other device remains stuck trying to calibrate. My second generation echo devices have no trouble calibrating the temperature sensor. I like my toys to work - I am disappointed with this new toy.	3	December 26, 2021	1

334	Echo 4th Gen	I’ve been an Alexa user for years and have loved it. I loved the features and the ease it brought to my life. The sound quality of this gen is great; the aesthetics are lovely. I never had a problem with Alexa and Alexa devices—until I upgraded to this gen. If you’re considering it, stop. Don’t do it. I have had nothing but trouble. And I’m not alone. Google it. The problem is pervasive and persistent.I plugged it in initially around Dec 1 and have regretted it since. My device randomly plays audacy at an absurd volume and won’t always shut off—sometimes I have to unplug it to get it to stop. I have tried resetting it, reinstalling the app, factory restores, removing all devices from my account, removing all skills/apps from the device, etc. I’ve watched videos, read help pages, and asked friends in IT to help. Nothing—NOTHING—resolves the issue. I have taken my Alexa down to no skills or apps. Basically it’s now an automated list maker and it STILL randomly plays Audacy (and by “plays” I mean “screams”). It only plays Audacy; nothing else…although it recently started to randomly beep at me. My privacy settings are as locked down as they can be and still—still—the problem remains.Don’t. Do. It. Go to a different system and let Amazon work through its issues in someone else’s home. I’ve had this gen for about 3 months and it’s spent about 1/3 of that time unplugged because the anxiety these random musical attacks trigger makes the whole system not worth it.I miss my Alexa.	1	February 22, 2022	0
335	Echo 4th Gen	"The only reason that I gave 2 stars is because the sound quality is great. That's where the fun stops.This device is so glitchy that I want to throw it out the window most days. For example, my morning alarm just went off; I'm laying 3 feet from 4th Gen Echo Dot; I ask it to stop the the alarm; from the living room, 30 feet away, I hear ""Morning Alarm stopped on bedroom"". Whyyyyyyy?When I ask Alexa to play music while I'm in the living room, she will respond from the proper device ""what would you like to listen to?"", but then she will start playing the music on the Echo Dot in my bedroom. When I tell her she is playing on the wrong device she'll respond ""I'm sorry, I don't recognize a device by that name"". When I ask her to stop playing the music it she won't, because she's does not recognize I'm talking about the bedroom unit. When I ask her to stop playing music in the Bedroom, she doesn't understand. When I ask her to play music, again, she says ""Amazon Music is currently streaming on another device"". Ugh. How far do think I can throw this thing?Hey Bezos, when you get back from douching around in outer space can you please hire someone to update your Echo Integration System. Thx."	2	August 23, 2021	0
336	Echo 4th Gen	I think the sound base is amazing.It only needs the time displayed on the actual echo	3	April 27, 2022	1
337	Echo 4th Gen	I have everything from the very first generation (still have my original, I got it during the trial release) through to this one.  The sound quality improved with the second and third generation, but I feel that this round one it went down.  It's harder to hear the responses, even with the volume up, and if not for the fact I have my music play through multiple devices, I would say the music sort of sucks as well.  I would opt for the earlier releases.  I don't need the hub, I have my own good setup at home, so that's not a reason to get it for most people either.	3	September 22, 2021	1
338	Echo 4th Gen	I don't like the new shape, it takes up more space on my small nightstand. I would've added a pic but Amazon wanted complete access to my camera and pics rather then me selecting one pic to add. The 3rd gen was better, 360 sound and light ring on top. The 4th gen bowling ball isn't 360, you have to put it's back towards a wall. Light ring is now on bottom of ball and is almost impossible to see the yellow ring of light during the daylight when you need it to receive weather alerts from the National Weather Service. The sound might be slightly better if you're standing in front of it but I'd rather have another 3rd gen and not this bowling ball. Don't fix what's not broken! I won't be buying anymore until they return to the cylinder 360 shape with the light ring on top.	3	July 8, 2021	1
339	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality on these new fourth generation Echo speakers is horrible compared with the previous generation Echo speakers—all of them. What happened?I am so disappointed. I worked with Amazon tech-support, and even they said there must be something wrong, so they processed a return and shipped me a new set and they are equally horrible. I have read independent reviews on third-party websites, and watched them on YouTube, where reviewerss are saying Generation 4 is a total fail. I sure hope the fifth generation will go back to the sound quality of previous generations.I have had many speakers from every generation going back to the first generation (which ironically, was one of the best sounding speakers they made).Also, when you pair these fourth generation Echo speakers with a Fire TV or Fire TV stick, they are somewhat acceptable on the trailers and previews, since the volume of those, same with commercials, is so artificially boosted, (though the speakers are still disappointingly soft and poor quality), but the minute you start the actual show or movie, the sound instantly becomes so quiet that I would equate it to about a volume level 4 on previous generations.I think these were rushed to market because the engineers thought the new round shape was so cool. What was wrong with the previous shape? In a failed effort to “fix” the ain’t-broke design, they completely broke the function.	2	June 5, 2021	0
340	Echo 4th Gen	"I recently traded in all my 1st, 2nd, and 3rd gen devices to ""upgrade"" to the 4th gen devices.  If you're thinking about it, DON'T DO IT!1) The 4th gen devices don't seem to pick up voice commands as well.  We frequently use the Echo in our family room on the 1st floor.  Even though we are 5 feet away and within line of sight of the Echo, our Echo show upstairs in a room with a *closed* door hears the command instead and prevents the family room Echo from responding.  The activity logs indicate the Echo Show wasn't the intended device, but ultimately none of them respond so we have to repeat the command.2) The sound is awful.  The previous Echo's had a nice range and good base.  The 4th gen echo sounds very hollow and tinny.  If you like to listen to music through your Echo, avoid the 4th gen devices!!3) The light ring is now on the bottom of the Echo, so unless the device is placed at a position lower than you, you probably won't be able to see it.  Considering the mic can't pick up your commands well, you'll often wonder if it's doing anything at all since you get no indications.While not a 4th gen specific issue, the Echo is going to constantly be trying to upsell you on Amazon services.  If you request a song that isn't on Prime, it's going to try and upsell you their Ultimate Music service, then it's going to start playing some ""station"" that is not the song you request.  100% of the time I have to further request that it stop playing the station, which it can't hear me well so I end up yelling for it to stop 4 or 5 times.  Overall, the Echo has gone from a fun device that was worth the potential privacy concerns to an annoying banner ad that you can't click to close.  The current user experience makes me just want to throw these things in the trash and I own 4 of them."	1	February 4, 2021	0
341	Echo 4th Gen	My echo, seem to have trouble staying connected and following through with task from the beginning. I contacted Amazon about this I was told there was nothing wrong with it and it just needed to be updated. After the update it continued to glitch out, over a year of fighting the echo. It finally stopped responding, I contacted Amazon. They troubleshooted the device multiple times, they couldn’t fix it. I was told its out of warranty and if I would have contacted them before hand with my problems that they could of helped but all they can do it give me a 15% discount on a new echo. I explained I did contact them before was told my device was fine and pointed this out. I was told sorry but I could buy a new one. Then the new one I looked at couldn’t ship to my address for whatever reason, but I told I could upgrade my device and pay double for the new echo with the 15% discount. Then after my purchase that Amazon will credit my account 10% of my new purchase. I feel like I got a faulty item from the beginning and was given the run around about the item and convinced the echo was fine. So I just assumed it was my internet being slow, which made since until I got a echo show for Christmas and it works perfectly without any problems. So now I have a echo show and a echo dot that’s just sitting on my shelf not responding at all.	1	March 6, 2022	0
342	Echo 4th Gen	"I'm not one of those reviewers who has a bit of Alexa devices in their home as well as a bit of Google Assistant.

Throughout my home I now own:Echo (4th generation)2 Echo Dots (both 3rd gen)Echo Show 8Echo Show 53 Echo FlexFire 8 HD PlusEcho Input (I wish I knew just how phenomenal of a deal these were when I purchased this one, id have 9 of these in my house and 1 device with visual output).Always having the appropriate expectations (ie never expected ie Echo flex to sound like a bose speaker) i have never once been even slightly disappointed with any of the products listed above....until this Echo (4th generation). I prefer the round design and I like to have the latest and greatest, that's all it is, sad but true. I never expected any of these products to actually regress though as their technology allegedly has improved continously. Id say after owning for a month or so im sitting at about a 70% hit rate when it comes to this advice recognizing it's name and and switching into a phase waiting for a command. Not sure what it is either, I've walked right up to and practically yelled ""ALEXA"" (and while I was frustrated I was sure to very clear spoken words) and yet it still didn't respond.I'm really hoping this is a software fix they can push out or I wouldn't hesitate to take this down to 1 star."	2	December 12, 2020	0
343	Echo 4th Gen	I love Alexa and own multiple Good evening.  ration of them starting from beta version. I highly recommend Alexa to everyone. However I am giving this 4the generation unit 3 stars as there is no significant difference between this and older version.  This newer unit works fine. I bought this newer 4th generation version thinking it must be better than the older version. I was disappointed as I don’t see a much of a difference at all. Sound quality is pretty much same as previous version.  Buttons and volume control ring is better in previous version. The older unit’s volume ring allows you to lower volume quickly with one smooth motion. In newer units you need to press small volume button multiple times to lower volume. This isn’t a show stopper as you can just voice control Alexa to lower volume. All this highlights is that controls were better thought thru in older unit.Bottom line I highly recommend Alexa to any 1st time user. However save yourself some money and buy older version as it works equally same as this newer version	3	November 19, 2020	1
344	Echo 4th Gen	I LOVED the 3rd gen Dot, which was my first foray into Alexa. So when the 4th gen Echo came out, I was hoping for better audio to play music in my living room space. With the Dot, I could quietly ask Alexa something, and she would pick up on it from 10-15 feet away. With this Echo, I have to repeat, and yell a bit for it pick up anything. THEN, the little ring will light up, and the Dot will answer from the other room -_-. I'm standing 5 ft away from the Echo, and about 30 feet away from the Dot. As far as the sound quality for music- it's a bit disappointing. It does seem to sound a touch better than the Dot's but not enough to justify the added cost and space that it takes up. If I had experienced this first, I think I would just try to hook up a better speaker to the Dot. I'm really glad that I gifted my friends the previous gen Dots (new ones weren't released yet), and not the new ones.	3	January 2, 2021	1
345	Echo 4th Gen	"I used to love these devices, but in the last year she's always adding at the end of every command i give her ""by the way ..."".

Just tonight she was telling me she can get me ready for the rings of power. Amazon should not be advertising their things in my home like that. They should leave it on their Fire TV and website. I don't need to hear about it when I want to turn my lights off or set a timer. Never buying another amazon smart home device."	1	October 3, 2022	0
346	Echo 4th Gen	As a stand alone speaker/Alexa assistant it works as advertised.  Impressed with the sound.  However, very disappointed in the difficulty to set-up additional Echo Dots throughout the house.  Have yet to figure out a good solution to allow our kids to each have an Echo Dot that is linked to their own Spotify account and still be able to use the intercom functionality.  Can't link an Echo Dot to a Kids or Teen Amazon account but only two adult accounts are allowed so two Echos/Dots no issue but more then that is a real pain.  Seems to make the intercom feature useless unless you want to all be linked to the same Spotify account and only be able to listen to music on one Echo at a time.  Not well thought out and very frustrating.	3	July 20, 2021	1

348	Echo 4th Gen	I really do like this, it is great for music. Unbelievable sound quality from such a small device. My only issue is that after paying $99 for it prior to Christmas , I see it all over in stores for as little as $30 and that pisses me off. I can understand a drop in price some but $70 is a sting.	3	January 4, 2022	1
349	Echo 4th Gen	I am pretty new to Alexa - I only have a Dot with a display. Thought I’d but a bigger one to have better sound… Who would’ve thought that the bigger model doesn’t have a display to even show me the clock?? One of the reasons I bought this thing was to replace my alarm clock that gets a few minutes late every month.Definitely returning. I hope gen5 has a display.	2	July 10, 2022	0
350	Echo 4th Gen	It requires much more customer interface than my previous Echo.  I sometimes need to make numerous requests  Unit is used for multiple applications: radio, weather, music(Amazon), alarm, reminders, shopping, controlling other devices in the home.  I am quite surprised and disappointed with all the verbal repeating I have to do.	3	January 22, 2022	1
351	Echo 4th Gen	I had one of the original 'tower' type Alexa echo's.  The sound was good, the light ring was on the top and because it was tower shape... didn't take up too much space. This new one is, in my opinion, too big, too ugly and hard to see the light ring. And if you want the battery ability, you must buy an additional base which makes it even larger and more ugly.ALSO, apparently it doesn't seem to matter what color you buy, your power cord will be white. I bought a black echo and a white electric cord was enclosed.I am not a happy amazon camper.	3	September 18, 2021	1

It is LOUD and there is NO WAY to turn it off.  This has been the same for years and they refuse to fix it.  So if you want to use this for bluetooth, you'll be wasting your money.  They Amazon programmers are apparently not smart enough to add this much desired feature of telling her to STOP YELLING AT ME.	1	October 21, 2022	0
357	Echo 4th Gen	Not sure why this is called “Premium Sound” While I don’t expect it to be as as good as Bose, I expected it to better for the price. The voice recognition is spotty, and doesn’t work as good as my old Gen 1. Thinking I may return…	3	January 31, 2022	1
358	Echo 4th Gen	Cuando digo que tiene excelente sonido es por mucho mejor que los demas echo que tengo ya voy el 4to, ahora bien el micrófono no te escucha muy bien, hay que gritarle un poco mas para que funciones pero no para morirse, lo que si ha estado ocurriendo es que le cuesta aun integrarse con las demás Echo, segunda y tercera generación, pero tambien creo que hay que actualizarlas también	3	December 11, 2021	1
359	Echo 4th Gen	I bought this thinking the sound would be better than on the smaller Echos that I have. It's fine, but not superior to the smaller version. I kept it since it was on sale when purchased. It would be nice if this included the digital clock.	3	January 30, 2022	1
360	Echo 4th Gen	Short answer: it is a functional smart speaker, but the sound is terrible.Long answer: it has more sound and bass than the echo dot, but the bass cracks and the treble is muddy. You might be better off with a dot than the sound from this speaker. If you are buying this instead of the dot going for better sound, don't! You are better off purchasing a JBL flip 4 and hooking up a dot to it.	3	November 21, 2021	1
361	Echo 4th Gen	I have had mine for about a year now.  I call customer service at least every 3rd month.  When you ask when someone was born who is famous, be sure you have the name exact and pronounce it correctly.  Otherwise you get someone else.  When you ask about an actor to find out how old they are you don't always get the right person.  You must know exactly what their full name is to hopefully get the right person. Setting routines up most of the time you need customer service to walk you through.  What seem logical is not. I have decided to give it one more year and if they do not improve getting information from it, I will give it to Goodwill and let someone else have the heard ache.  NOT a real stable device to live with. If you are a very young person and like a lot of silly things then this is the device for you. I usually ask this device first for info and then I have to go to another program on my phone to find the right answer. Think about this before you buy!!!	2	October 28, 2021	0
362	Echo 4th Gen	"I'm comparing against a Gen 1 Echo and 2 Gen 1 Dots which I've had since they first hit the market. My Gen 4 device was defective: both hard of hearing (my Gen 1 Dot 30' away in another room would hear me and with this device I had to yell to get it to activate) and the speaking voice sounded muffled compared to my other devices. Other dislikes: I ordered a black Echo but it came with a white cable. It's a minor point but I think a black cable would be more appropriate. Worse however was that the cable is ridiculously short (compared to all my Gen 1 devices) which limits placement without the need for an extension cord. Overall, fairly disappointed and returned. HOWEVER, aside from the cord color and length which would have still resulted in my returning the device, I'm hoping that my ""operationally defective device"" was an anomaly and I just got a bad one. Overall, my wife and I enjoy the conveniences Alexa adds to our smart home and this poor review shouldn't deter you from trying out Alexa if you never have. The 4th Gen Echo did not work for me, so I instead purchased a 3rd Gen Dot; it is my 4th Alexa device."	1	June 4, 2022	0
363	Echo 4th Gen	The other day my TV had no sound, I went into the room where my new Alexa was and it was the voice of the TV.  I told Alexa to go off and she didn't listen.  I then unplugged it.  I am afraid to plug it in again.	3	January 14, 2022	1
364	Echo 4th Gen	I purchased this device on the release date and it has been giving me issues ever since. The main problem is the response time when I say the wake work and it not listening after I start to ask a question. I know this may not be the same experience with many people but compared to the echo studio this seems way slower. I have tried different trouble shooting tips to no avail. I am going to reach out to amazon support to see if there is a solution but I just believe my device my be defective.The sound quality for this device is great and an improvement over the previous generations of the echo and I actually like the design. Besides the lag in responding I would be very happy with the device but it really get annoying when you ask it something it takes seconds to acknowledge you and then when you ask a question it just shuts off. If not for that this would be five stars all across.	3	February 6, 2021	1
365	Echo 4th Gen	The Apple Music integration doesn’t allow you to access your Apple Music library or any stations you normally listen to. You have to explicitly tell Alexa what you want to listen from Apple Music and then it fetches it to the Alexa app. Not what I wanted. I want to be able to listen to Apple Music on my Amazon Echo.	2	July 13, 2022	0
366	Echo 4th Gen	I own many Echo's and I am a fan of the products. With that said, I purchased the Echo 4th Gen (The Ball) to replace my Echo 1st Gen (The Cylinder) as an upgrade. Well I have to say I am a bit disappointed. The 1st Gen sounds better and has a bit more power to it. Try a little harder guys.	3	December 23, 2021	1
367	Echo 4th Gen	"The sound for music is better.  The design is different, still deciding if I like it better or just different.  The front facing speakers as opposed to cylindrical doesn't seem to pick up my voice.  Always yelling ""ALEXA""!  Many times have to say Alexa 2, 3 or 4 times before she picks it up.  If not directly in front of the speaker the voice recognition is poor.  If music is playing or the TV is on, you have to speak loud and clear or she doesn't hear.  It is this speaker, because I have two others on the main level of the house and sometimes one of them will pick up my voice from 20 feet away in a different room and the new 4th generation in the same room with me just sits there.  Not sure if it's worth the frustration or constantly repeating commands to get the better sound quality.  Debating about just returning and waiting for a 5th generation with a better quality microphone."	3	December 25, 2020	1
368	Echo 4th Gen	Won't even see bluetooth amplifiers or bluetooth devices outside of their Alexa Preset Profiles which aren't the same as the standard bluetooth.  I have a Samsung 5.1 surround system with a Samsung Bluetooth to Coax adapter that works with everything android, iphone, Windows computers even FireTVs but not the Echo's.  Same thing goes for my Fosi Amplifier w Bluetooth that I purchased on Amazon. Everything works with it except the Echos's. This renders my Echo's and my Amazon Music Account USELESS!  Either fix your bluetooth problem or give us all back our money and then you can cancel my amazon music account! A month is long enough to fix the bluetooth problem! It feels like there is no intention of fixing it now!	2	April 6, 2022	0
369	Echo 4th Gen	"Had for a few months now. Sound quality isn't much different than the original echo we had, and at least the original one worked every time until it broke. This one doesn't respond half the time, and when it does respond sometimes it says it doesn't know what you're talking about, and other times it just makes that annoying ""bong"" sound and does nothing. This is during something as simple as turning on lights or asking it to shuffle songs. Wouldn't buy again and starting to look at other smart speakers."	2	June 11, 2022	0
370	Echo 4th Gen	I needed a hub to connect a Philips motion sensor using the “Zigbee” standard to a smart bulb. Amazon says this has a “built-in Zigbee smart home hub” and allows you to “Easily set up compatible Zigbee devices,” but it does not connect to Philips Zigbee motion sensors. A separate Philips bridge is required for those. This misled into buying the Echo when I did not need it.	3	December 9, 2021	1
371	Echo 4th Gen	I’ve had the old Alexa for years continually having problems with it doesn’t recognize what you’re saying doesn’t answer doesn’t hear you doesn’t really work very good And the new or Alexa exactly the same thing on the market this product you should do a better job take some lessons from Apple	3	January 6, 2022	1
372	Echo 4th Gen	"First off, it's ugly. Really a big let down. Amazon's first alexa was the best design. They should fire whoever is in charge of the design of this device. I really appreciate the volume ring so much more than the + - buttons for volume.Next, is that that it works okay. Sound is fairly decent but the connect between the device and the Amazon ""cloud"" is really buggy. Sometimes, it'll play all day. Other days it will stop after about 20 minutes. It doesn't seem to understand what I say sometimes as well. It will either not do anything or do something entirely different. And if you say anything to it, it refers you to the support section of the app.The idea is great but it's not done well. They need to rehire some folks and return to the cylinder shape. Hopefully with the volume ring instead of buttons. My original alexa is still functioning flawlessly. Wish they still had that quality.Good luck."	3	February 13, 2021	1
373	Echo 4th Gen	I already had a few 3rd generation Echo Dots, and 1) Wanted to add a hub, 2) Was intrigued by the press reviews of the 4th generation devices. So when the “limited edition” Echo Red was issued I eventually decided to give it a try as it fits with the Feng Shui of the place it’s in. So, how’d it work out?Pros:• Sound quality is definitely better (in my space).• Woo-Hoo, I’ve got a hub!• This particular edition, the Red, suits my decor schema perfectlyCons• The microphone doesn’t work well. I’ve enough devices that this is largely immaterial, but let’s just say it’s obvious that’s this is not the device I’m talking to. That’s kinda sad as that also means I’m rarely interacting with Alexa over the new chipset.• Sad but true: As others have noted 4th generation devices do not pair with other generation devices. Sad. I can’t use this as part of a stereo pair. (Here’s hoping Amazon issues a software patch!)	3	January 12, 2021	1
374	Echo 4th Gen	I have 3 of these things now, all different flavors. I need to speak louder for this unit to hear me. And when I speak louder the one in the kitchen hears me. Maybe I missed a sensitivity setting somewhere.	3	February 2, 2022	1
375	Echo 4th Gen	I had a 1st Gen Alexa. She was tall, elegant, and dare I say graceful. But as all things do, she died. I think her carcass is around here somewhere. This new Alexa came and she's pretty - one big bubble. But her voice recognition skills are terrible. If I'm playing the Jeopardy app I had to have meditated ahead of time in order to have the patience for the 18 times it craps out during the game. I miss Alex Trebek, but it makes me want to kill him. When she eventually comes down off her high horse long enough to play music, she's very fickle about what she'll play. She'll play Billy Joel, but don't even think about asking her to play music from Encanto. She'll make you feel dumb for wasting her time by asking.Do yourself a favor and take care of your 1st or 2nd Gen Echo. They're a rare breed and deserve all the love, care, and attention you can give them.	2	December 21, 2021	0
376	Echo 4th Gen	Not for people who are technically deficient.  I'm not good with computers and associated items - this item requires troubleshooting at times and is above my pay grade.  Not as simple as they make you believe.  😉	3	January 31, 2022	1
377	Echo 4th Gen	I occasionally have to yell to get it's attention. The internal thermometer needs to be better calibrated, as it's a couple of degrees off.Bass quality is big, and music is clear.	3	March 5, 2022	1
378	Echo 4th Gen	I have multiple echo devices and in general think they're great. I was disappointed a bit that this 4th gen device was not as good at recognizing its wake word ('Alexa'), as my older echo devices.  With the 4th generation device I have to be very careful to directly face the unit and enunciate when using the wake word.  My older units do not require this.(FWIW - I've altered the positioning of this 4th gen device a few times to ensure it wasn't some sort of audio bouncing that was the issue. The unit performs the same regardless of its location.)Also, unlike my older devices, this 4th generation Echo seems to often just not respond if it cannot answer or properly interpret a voice command/request.  I can see the wake word activates the unit but then it does not respond to commands it has trouble with. I have mixed feelings about this.  I don't miss the occasional 'I did not understand that request' (paraphrasing the response older Echo devices used.) but at the same time really dislike the device just going silent as though nothing had been said - and forcing me to wake it again.To be clear - the issues with this 4th generation device are truly minor.I remain a big fan of echo devices and Alexa in general.Solid build quality, excellent speech interpretation, amazing performance overall.	2	March 13, 2021	0
379	Echo 4th Gen	Sound: 3/5Design: 2/5Alexa Hub: 4/5Mic: 2/5I was looking forward to getting the 4th generation echo, I wasn't sure about it after reading all the reviews but I thought I will give it a try anyhow.I had the 1st generation Echo which was getting replaced by the 4th generation. I didn't really care for the 4th generation sphere design but I had hoped that the technology will make up for it. I was wrong the Echo Dot in the other room answers my questions 😂🤷🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ very disappointed!!! Never had such an issue with 1st generation Echo, now I think why did I replace it in the first place. It even used to prompt if I got the response from the right device.The most disappointing is the Amazon support not helpful at all. When I reached out to the Chat support they gave me the excuse device software was out of date, I asked why it didn't update automatically, they told me device needs to be idle for half hour. Forget during the day when everyone is awake, it didn't find an idle time at night as well when everyone was asleep 🤣😂I was able to reproduce the issue today, I asked the Echo 3 questions but every time the Echo Dot in the different room responded and when I called Amazon support, they asked me to reproduce the issue even though they could see in my voice history which device responded to the questions.I tried to reproduce the issue when I was on call, it didn't happen, they said we will call in an hour. I never heard back from Amazon support and instead got an email saying they couldn't reach me. Very disappointed!!Verdict: I won't suggest to upgrade...poor device and very horrible customer service. 1st generation Echo was definitely louder and I preferred the overall design. The issues with the mic are annoying.P.S. Don't give excuses to someone who is from software industry 😏	1	February 19, 2021	0
380	Echo 4th Gen	Before this device I used a Google Nest.  The voice recognition on the Amazon Echo does not compare to Google Nest.  The Amazon Echo, gets confused about 40% of the times, this never happened with the Google Nest.  After 6 months of use, Alexa goes silent (no light) and the only way to fix this is to unplug and re-plug the device.  I have been patiently doing this, hoping the issue was going to get fixed on its own but for the last two month the issue is occurring more and more often and I now need to unplug/re-plug the device about every 2-3 days.  Another issue with the device is I usually have it at a low volume to listen to my tv (line in) and during the day I raise the volume but at the same time, Alexa’s volume is raised so when I say a command, Alexa is extremely loud.  I wish Alexa’s volume was separate to avoid this. Now let’s talk about warranty coverage...  It's unbelievably painful to find and get to warranty support for this device.  Once I found the link to chat, I was on a chat troubleshooting for about 2 hours.  At the end, when the agent decided to process the warranty, she wanted me to ship the item first to Amazon, wait a few days for them to process it and then send me the replacement.  The agent then told me she couldn't process it and asked me to delete my home address and re-enter (to check, if that was going to allow her to process the request).  I requested to have a supervisor call me and as I'm writing this, I'm still waiting for the supervisor to take some type of action.	1	September 9, 2021	0

382	Echo 4th Gen	So, we’ve had the 4th gen for a year and a half. I understand the updated echo can hear you over loud music, however, the echo still fails to understand word & names when we request songs. It’s so bad that we have to walk over to the echo to repeat ourselves. Sometimes I have to spell words and names. Can’t wait for the newest addition, or for a sale on an older edition.	2	June 23, 2022	0
383	Echo 4th Gen	"Compré esperando que tenga un mejor reconocimiento de voz que mi echo dot de la misma generación; sin embargo, a pesar de tener más micrófonos según las especificaciones técnicas, tiene un mal reconocimiento inclusive para activarse, a veces hay que repetir fuerte y en varias ocasiones el comando de activación ""Alexa"""	3	January 4, 2022	1
384	Echo 4th Gen	My Dots alert me when Amazon delivers immediate. The Dot can hear me 15 feet away while this one only 5 feet. The Ball alerts my Amazon orders up to 12 hours after the Dot. Sounds good but hard of hearing.	3	January 19, 2022	1
385	Echo 4th Gen	I really liked my gen 2 echo. This new one does not sound as nice. Doesn’t look as nice. It has a white cord that does not match, and Alexa turns up the volume when I say “Alexa turn off”. I’ll play with the EQ more but the Gen 2 sounded great out of the box. Lights on the bottom are also annoying.	3	December 1, 2021	1
386	Echo 4th Gen	"This is a good speaker/alexa. Here's the problem: the marketing tells you that you can pair this echo with a fire tv ""to feel scenes come to life with home theater audio."" The reality is that audio can only come from EITHER your tv's speakers OR your echo. NOT BOTH. It isn't a home theater experience at all unless you want to buy multiple echo devices. And then it is only possible to pair the fire tv with a maximum of 2 echo devices and a sub. So even if you want to spend extra money, it's going to be a subpar ""home theater"" experience.  It took me an hour on customer service getting passed around before I was told that it was impossible to get sound from both the tv speakers and the echo at the same time (despite the fact that it will do this to play music, according to customer support it is not possible while watching tv). Hopefully this review will save others some time!"	3	December 27, 2020	1
387	Echo 4th Gen	device is unresponsive or does not answer questions correctly or play requests for music. nor will Alexa stop when it starts with the weong request.  I would like to slow down responses as the speech from alexa is often too fast to understand and respond.	3	January 10, 2022	1
388	Echo 4th Gen	I purchased a 4th gen Echo dot, but meant to purchase a 4th gen Echo.  A few days later, there was a price drop on the 4th gen Echo, so I bought one and compared them.First, I should've realized the price dropped for a reason... the reviews which state that the Echo mic is bad are so true.  I have to speak so loud (even when no other sounds in the room), I can be heard two rooms away.When Alexa does respond, there's a serious lag and the volume temporarily decreases (long enough that I thought I'd accidentally asked Alexa to lower the volume) only to realize this happens every time I ask Alexa anything.The Echo sound is relatively full.  However, I prefer the midrange of the Echo dot.I don't care for either device as a single speaker so I tried to pair the Echo and the Echo dot.What??  Each speaker pairs individually with FireTV, smart light bulbs, etc., but an Echo and Echo dot will only work together for music and, possibly, audio books.They CAN'T BE PAIRED together for stero listening with, e.g., FireTV.  I researched this to ensure I wasn't missing something and all web results verified this issue.  Please let me know if I'm wrong!Bottom line, I'll be returning the 4th gen Echo for sure.  Might keep the 4th gen Echo dot.	2	February 26, 2021	0
389	Echo 4th Gen	The goodClear audio at low and mid volume. Temperature sensor is a nice addition.The neutralHas some kind of onboard voice processor but I don't notice any improvements to voice recognition or response speed as a result.The badDoesn't hear me as well as my 3rd Gen EchoDoesn't sound good above 50% volume - it's as if the device just increases the treble only and can't increase volume on low-mid frequency beyond the 50% threshold. Above 70% it starts to distort, above 80% it's distorted to all heck. Would be better if the max volume was limited to match the device capabilities instead of allowing users to crank beyond the distortion threshold. Essentially, in the current state we only get 5 usable volume levels. Above that it just sounds terrible.For reference, the 3rd Gen echo I find to sound decent up to about 70% volume before noticeable distortion occurred. In addition the 3rd Gen can actually hear me so I'd just recommend skipping the 4th generation.	3	December 6, 2020	1
390	Echo 4th Gen	At low volume levels this speaker is just average, a little tincanish even.  The sound is clear in the mid-range, but flat in the wings..  If there is an equalizer it is impossible to find.  Not nearly as good as the original Echo.  But, you need a hub, this is the only choice.  It also skips occasionally, WiFi connection was better on a Dot I had in the same location. The ball design makes the thing an accident waiting to roll off whatever surface. There should be a nesting ring to keep the goofy thing from rolling away.  It is impractical when handling, in that locating controls is mostly visual and not tactile.  Dust sticks to it.  On the plus side in a tiny room it is less disappointing.  In a open area, forget it.	3	June 6, 2021	1
391	Echo 4th Gen	Can't access enough info.  Responds before I ask the full question.  Quits playing songs by any particular singer after a small number.  Doesn't know what I asked sometimes.	3	February 22, 2022	1
392	Echo 4th Gen	I’ve had the original Alexa for about 6 years now and I wanted an upgrade. I purchased this speaker thinking it would be better in sound quality but I was disappointed. The sound quality is sub par and it does not turn up very loud if you like to blast your music like I do while cleaning, cooking or taking a shower. The main reason why I returned my purchase is because it just stopped connecting to my WiFi. No matter what I tried, it would not connect. There were a few other annoying glitches that I dealt with that I never had happen with the original speaker. The thing that I did enjoy was the color changing light bulb that came with it. Other than that, I’ll just continue using my old speaker. It actually connects and sounds better than the newer version.	2	January 31, 2022	0
393	Echo 4th Gen	It works as well as any of our Alexa products. Bought this one to upgrade my original dot, but it’s going back, because no one in the house likes it’s sphere shape…will have to wait for the next redesign.	3	January 26, 2022	1
394	Echo 4th Gen	"This makes no sense.  We purchased a black echo for a reason.  So it would blend in on our black counter with black backsplash.  Now we have a big, white plug and white cord sticking out like a ""sore thumb.""  Why can't you send a black cord with a black echo???"	2	July 11, 2022	0
395	Echo 4th Gen	I loved this device until I played techno music and busted the speaker.  It was between volume 3 and 4 which isn’t loud at all, and it busted it due to the bass.  I didn’t change the bass setting on my echo either.	3	January 9, 2022	1
396	Echo 4th Gen	Update: Changed up to 3 stars. I received a call from amazon and they helped me fix the long delay issue. You cannot have it give a tone when you say the wake word, something that I liked. The bad is that the temp sensor is always way off. I have 2 different sensors in the same room to check and it's about 10deg off. I got this so that I can have it turn on and off an ac unit at specific temps. The room gets over 80deg while the rest of the house is like 70deg. The sensor in the echo will say it's 71 but all the other sensors will say 80 in this room.Update: changed this to a 1 star. I constantly have to repeat commands to my echo and then it will take about 60 seconds to complete them, if it ever does complete them.Love the sound quality but it takes longer than my 3rd gen echo dot did to execute commands.	3	October 27, 2020	1
397	Echo 4th Gen	The sound and look of the speaker is great however as mentioned in other reviews, the microphone is really bad, it literally SUCKS!!! I bought 2 echos, one for my living room and another for my bedroom, both sit at about 5-6 ft away from where I regularly speak to them from and when they are not reproducing anything I have a hard time getting them to hear me. Not to mention when the music is on, especially on high volume, you literally have to SCREAM to have a possibility of them hearing you. This is both with the dot and echo 4th gen, for comparison I have 3rd gen echo dots, echo show 5 and echo flex, needless to say they all hear me waaaaay easier, to give an idea of this: I have an echo flex out in my hallway outside of my bedroom and sometimes it hears me before the echo in the room, despite it being easily an additional 5ft away with walls in the way. It's very disappointing that they downgraded the microphones on these for whatever the reason, especially because one of it's main features to sell is you being able to communicate through voice, for this reason I have to give it a 2 star rating regardless of all it's pros. I really hope Amazon look into this and either gives a recall or some sort of update that can fix this problem	2	February 18, 2021	0
398	Echo 4th Gen	Bought these to connect to Samsung tv, connection works great . However you need to disconnect it from tv before turning off tv. If you don't Alexa stops communicating,  you literally have to unplug the speaker  to get it back to communicating!	3	January 7, 2022	1
399	Echo 4th Gen	"I recently upgraded from the old, tall Alexa to this new 4th generation version.  I also got a new Echo Dot with clock.  I loved my old Alexa Echo and old Alexa Dot.  I am not so happy with these newer versions.  Perhaps it's the new shape, but it's clear that the new devices do not pick up on sound as well as the older versions did.  I have to constantly repeat ""Alexa"" to get their attention.  Is the new dome shame inhibiting them in some way?  And also very annoying is the fact that because the light is now at the bottom of the device, instead of at the top of a tower, it's not seen as easily.  So sometimes, Alexa may hear, but the light is not visible.  Why did you ruin a good thing?  The dome shape is not nearly as appealing and it doesn't do the job as well.  Very disappointing."	3	January 12, 2021	1
400	Echo 4th Gen	Tried this out, compared this to our existing Echo and sound quality was better.  Been in use in our great room and her hearing us was not good.  Tried it in about 4 locations and not very good hearing.  Have moved it to our bedroom, still doesn't hear well, but then it isn't used as much.	3	December 7, 2021	1
401	Echo 4th Gen	I feel bamboozled. I have owned every Echo/Echo+, and every time it has gotten progressively better. I’ve really enjoyed watching a well-made product get better and better with no major downsides for years. I actually look forward to buying the new generation each time.So I’m really, really disappointed with this fourth generation. Its smaller form factor means its microphone is physically located much closer to its base, so if you had your Echo+ on a side table (like me), expect your experience to take a serious nosedive. I repeat myself four or five times, getting louder each time sometimes. I have an echo dot in the next room and about 25% of the time IT picks up before the Echo 4th gen does.An overall downgrade, unfortunately. Making devices smaller is not always an improvement. Maybe the mics are placed in worse locations, I don’t pretend to know.	2	January 13, 2022	0
402	Echo 4th Gen	Do you enjoy manually turning the speaker in your direction every time you move around the room? Well, you'll be glad to hear that Amazon has an Echo for you! It only plays out of one side - revolutionary! Just pick it up whenever you move and turn the speaker in your direction!Seriously a terrible product, but when compared to Apple home pod.....it's still awful just not as awful as Apple home pod. Setting the bar high is not part of the strategy.  Which brings me to this:  if you want to play anything other than Amazon branded content - you will have to be prepared to battle the device constantly as it refuses to acknowledge that you have the default set to competitor subscriptions. Apple Music is Alexa's arch rival! She will do anything to keep you away from your music. She will try to shove Amazon music subscriptions down your throat even though you have Prime! (Hmmm- need to get rid of that then...).  I can deal with the poor sound quality but not frequent devious detours back to Amazon music as the default and having to reconnect my Apple account. I don't want to hear anymore reasons, I just want the games to stop!	2	September 4, 2021	0
403	Echo 4th Gen	I am a  disabled woman confined to a power wheelchair most of my life. I live on a small fixed income. I have an older affordable flip cell phone. I received the Alexia as a Christmas gift. I was so thrilled until I discovered I need a phone with the ability of applications to use the Alexia. I looked at the prices of smartphones and they are far out of my price range. WHY, did you make Alexia work on applications? And WHY didn't you just build the application into the Alexia? Now I can't use it at all until I can afford to buy a smartphone. So angry with you, I just sat and cried when I found this out. It's always all about making as much money as possible, isn't it? So glad there are fewer days ahead of me than behind me. I will probably never get to use it. I have grown weary of this world of greedy money and power hungry people.	3	January 1, 2021	1
404	Echo 4th Gen	Heavy on the bass with next to no treble.  The mic, as with all Echo devices are horrible.  The noise cancelation and ability to block its own sound are laughable.Edit 5/30/2021: I got a call within 8 minutes of posting this review. I was shocked but it was customer service to address my concerns. That level of Customer Care is unheard of and for that reason alone I would recommend using the Alexa devices. As for their tips; they showed me my area of lack of knowledge and how to correct it. In the app you can adjust the Bass, Mid, and Treble I didn't know that. Having made this changes the sound is far better. For the mic they had me remove and resync the devices. This shad had a somewhat positive result but it is still to early to be 100% sure. I would say accuracy has gone up 50% but still not fully there. I hope this can be figured out further with software updates. I will update this again in a few months to see if it has changed. For now I highly recommend the devices for the interface, flexibility, sound, price, and the absolute boss level Customer Care. Mic still needs work but it is minor at this point compared to all the other things.	2	May 25, 2021	0
405	Echo 4th Gen	MATCH THE COLOR OF THE CORD TO THE DEVICE... or, don't offer color choices at all! Simple.The sound quality is... meh. Not great, to bass-y and not well balanced. Alexa is borderline mentally disabled and not useful for much.Save your money, voice recognition isn't ready for prime time. None of the devices work very well.	3	December 3, 2021	1
406	Echo 4th Gen	Fourth time with 4th Generation Echo was NOT the charm.We have the older Echo as well as the Echo Dot. These work great. This new Echo is awful!We are now on our THIRD 4th generation Echo. The first one (Round One) hooked up beautifully to all our devices, but was totally hard of hearing. We would stand 2 feet away from Alexa and scream to get her to respond. This device is located on our main floor. The device in our bedroom a floor up and rooms away would respond before the one two feet away did. So Amazon send us a new one. This was after spending 45 minutes on the phone with customer service.Round Two 4th generation hears perfectly well but is completely was unable to connect with out two brand new Philips Hue light bulbs which were part of the package that came with Round One. Chatted first with someone in the US on fixing this. Seemed like we might be getting somewhere but she put me on hold. Next thing I knew I was talking with someone in India (I think) explaining the whole thing ALL OVER AGAIN. He put be through to someone in the Philippines. Starting from scratch AGAIN I was on the phone with her for 57 minutes!!! It was truly the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result! She finally says something is wrong with your 4th generation ECHO and ships me another new one.Round Three 4th generation Echo arrives today. Same nightmare as Round Two. Spent 40 minutes on the phone with Amazon Customer services. He states that the only literature he has to go off of is really old!!! Echo is STILL NOT ABLE TO SEE new Philips Hue Lights! He tells me to contact Philips Hue.I've now been on the phone with Philips Hue for 60 minutes! Still not working.Amazon's customer service is NOT knowledgeable about this issue!	1	December 22, 2020	0
407	Echo 4th Gen	Not to much louder than a small regular echo dot in my opinion.  If you're looking for good stereo sound or quality this is not the device for that. It gets the job done to allow you to hear some whistle wile you work music or audio books but that is all.	3	December 13, 2021	1
408	Echo 4th Gen	Updating - now pretty much unusable. Doesn’t pick up our voice at allUpdating - over time, it has gotten worse. I talk directly to it,  but it never responds. All of the devices in the other rooms much further away answer. Even with an update, the microphone doesn’t work well.Updating my review to one less star. I have an Alexa in my kitchen, my living room (this one) , and my bedroom. Both are dots. You can be standing in the living room talking to the device over it, and the other Alexas respond to you. The microphone is awful. Thinking about returning. I stopped delivery on the 3 to order the 4 when it came out. Now, I wish I didn’t.My black device came with a horrible looking white aftermarket cord that is not Amazon original ; at least match the color.  It sounds ok; I have Alexa devices all around my house and compared to the dot, I think it’s honestly just ok. Not amazing.	1	October 22, 2020	0
409	Echo 4th Gen	I have 4 different versions of the echoes and the other 3 work great but for some reason this one is constantly dropping the music and seams to get confused easily.	2	August 18, 2022	0
410	Echo 4th Gen	I had gen 1,3 and some other.long story short: this is not better, just more expensive. Save your money. Go for the previous  gen. Half the price and pick up our voices before this one does....I DO NOT RECOMMEND!- doesnt recognize / hear well (no better than gen 1 and 3 if not worse)- microphone seems even more directional... an issue since we place it in the middle but unless you talk AT it or yell... well you just have to yell- sound quality is not great. I dont use alexa for music and I surely will not with this thing (dont listen the reviews of pcmag etc... bs... this thing is terrible)- WHITE cable? For a black alexa? Why?... so it sticks out?- the ball shape - it is not good looking and it makes the thing stick out even more when i need it to melt in the background. Let’s face it: it s not a piece of art so the quieter it is visually, the better.Bottom line is it s not an upgrade. It’s the same product as before, more expensive, uglier. We are disappointed they haven’t improved the microphone.If you don’t have one, the cheaper one is the way to go. If you have one... don’t upgrade - amazon does NOT offer such a thing. Just taking your money.	2	February 8, 2021	0
411	Echo 4th Gen	Initial setup was a breeze.  But failed multiple times when trying to get it to join existing Alexa groups already in the house, because it was 'unrecognized network'.  Only way to have all the Echo speaker groups to integrate was to reset router (Nighthawk Mesh) to factory settings and rebuild the entire house network of wi-fi devices using new network name and password, which took alot of time.	3	November 5, 2021	1
412	Echo 4th Gen	Many times I asked a question and I would be given a totally different answer.  I never had this problem with google dot.	3	March 7, 2022	1
413	Echo 4th Gen	"I own the original Echo and love it. The new model is a disappointment. First, I find the sound quality to be lacking, worse than the 1st edition. It is pretty fuzzy and is really distorted at higher volumes.Also the new Echo does not include a remote. This wouldn't be a problem if the voice recognition worked better. As it is I find myself screaming at the darn thing to get it to respond. I have driven myself crazy  trying to sync the two devices to play at the same time. They never play the same thing together, and half the time one plays while the other talks about something unrelated to the request. They occasionally get the fire-tv stick in on the action, just for fun. I still haven't figured it out.I have the original Echo in my living room and the new Echo in the bedroom. They are a full room and hallway apart from one another. If I am on the couch the Echo in the bedroom responds and if I am in the  bedroom standing right next to the new Echo, the one in the living room responds. This is ridiculously annoying.I'm actually annoyed with myself for getting so annoyed by what is essentially a first world problem. Arghh.  ""Alexa, play the meditation station."""	2	April 28, 2021	0
414	Echo 4th Gen	We replaced a couple order Alexa units with these because they were supposed to have much better sound.  They sort of due.  They have much better directional sound, but don't fill a space/room as well as the older non-directional units.THe biggest annoyance is these are much worse at voice recognition, they are always struggling to hear us, and when they do hear us they frequently mistake the command.  These are in the exact same locations as our old units that worked great.	2	May 21, 2022	0
415	Echo 4th Gen	It has had some problems with setting on the volume. It kept returning to the factory setting of 3 witch was way way too low. I called about this and had a hard time under standing what I was being told to fix it right now it's volume is stable so far.	3	December 9, 2021	1
416	Echo 4th Gen	It can’t hear you when the tv is on.  It says it has adaptive volume, I’ve heard no evidence that this is true.  I ask it to change volume and it periodically tells me “that feature is not supported”.  I don’t understand why the reminders volume is not set by the alarm volume.  Reminders whisper and alarms sound fine.  My echo dot seems to be far more reliable than the echo.	3	October 28, 2021	1
417	Echo 4th Gen	Me: “Alexa, lights on.”“Several things share the name ‘lights,’ which one do you want?”Me: “All of them!”“There’s no device named ‘all of them.’”Me: “Alexa, lights on!!!”*lights turn on*	3	February 3, 2022	1
418	Echo 4th Gen	"As a speaker, it's good. Sounds nice. Understands me well. And can be helpful with many tasks and reminders, but what ruins it for me is Amazon uses it unapologetically to constantly advertise and make sales. It is intrusive.For instance, ask it for the weather and after giving you a response, it says, ""By the way, I can now recommend gift ideas. Would you like to hear one now?""Seriously?! Who thought that I would need a smart speaker that spends it's time trying to convince me to buy more crap. How is that going to make life better?I've turned all the settings off for advertising, but it ignored it in this case as it doesn't think that gift ideas is another form of advertising. If this continues, I will be selling all of my Amazon stuff and dumping them altogether.I don't need a billboard in my house. Maybe I'll try Google smart speakers instead."	2	December 19, 2021	0
419	Echo 4th Gen	"It claims I can add other speakers to it and have surround sound in my entire house.  So I followed the instructions to get my existing Bose speakers added as devices, than created the groups.  It will play one of the Bose speakers, tried the other but failed to connect, and doesn't play itself when it plays the one Bose speaker it does play.  I want all three speakers (including the Echo) playing the same thing in synch, controlled by Alexa.  When I tried to get Alexa to do it she asks for a speaker to group, I say ""SoundTouch"" and she says she can't find ""SoundTouch"" then searches and says ""I found SoundTouch, should I add that speaker?""  Duh, that's what I asked for."	3	July 1, 2021	1
420	Echo 4th Gen	Was a pretty good deal for the upgrade until I received it....  It's a black echo with a white cord.  What an eye sore.  They also used a cheap stadard plug this time.  Definitely a  down grade.	3	January 2, 2022	1
421	Echo 4th Gen	Bout this to replace my gen 1 in my living room. My gen 1 is now in the basement. This new one can’t hear worth a damn. Have to yell even when I’m only 6 feet away. Never had or currently have that issue with the gen 1.it looks nicer but other than that, gen 1 is way better	2	June 22, 2022	0
422	Echo 4th Gen	"So i lost my connector for my smart lights and my friend said hey alexa works with them regardless So i was all for it... Until i received it and wow... sound quality is wonky set it to 10 talks really loud but that's it, alarms will be quiet music eh and the quality of the music is subpar.. so yeah.  Now Voice recognition is dumb it'll just randomly activate for no reason no prompting no one saying anything close to ALEXA nothing... now some of the apps are kinda cool for it but not worth.. most of them you have to buy which is dumb and just greedy and then ask it anything and it'll say ""I do not know that"" or something similar i could ask my Google home ANYTHING and it would try to answer me... i could ask it to convert 62.23 USD to CAN and it would no problems but ask Alexa ""I do not know that"" i could ask google home ANYTHING and i would get an answer and yeah some of the more Vague ones with google would get me some randomish or not exactly what i wanted but atleast it would try and would get something close instead of a big Pile of Nothing... i wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this period, especially over a google home or even a google home mini"	2	February 18, 2021	0
423	Echo 4th Gen	The sound of this speaker is great but if you plan on using 2 or more of them in parallel, go with something else.  I purchased 2 of the echo 4th gen speakers and in 2 different homes(on 2 different internet/wifi systems) they would regularly cut out at least every other song.  As such I bought 2 of the new echo dots, and have them bluetoothed to much better speakers and have save >$100.  Sadly, with the 2 brand new echo dots, I am still getting the cut out and at times static but only when I am playing the music over multiple dots.  The echo 4th gen speakers are being returned as the cost does not justify the music regularly cutting out.  I'm sure that at some point they will figure out how to run multiple echo speakers/dots without the music cutting out or high levels of static, but until then I am going to cut my losses.	3	December 12, 2020	1
424	Echo 4th Gen	Every request fulfilled by this horrible box comes with an added request from the box.What's the weather?It's 65 degress outside.  *Do you also want to know the humidity?*What time is it?It's 9 am.  *By the way, I can also set timers and alarms.  Would you like to try that now?*Every.  Single. Request. Comes with an additional comment, question or suggestion.  I can't get this thing to do what it used to do when I bought it...

426	Echo 4th Gen	Don't think it's recognition is as good as my older echo. The sound is better but the sacrifice is the size and form of the object. Guess I'll live with it for now.	3	February 1, 2022	1
427	Echo 4th Gen	Had the echo for guess going on 6 months.  Was great to begin with.  Sound is decent and really only thing i use it for is controlling lights.  For the past month or so though the damn ring light will come on white and just spin all the time.  I chatted with  customer service a couple weeks ago and their fix was to uninstall the app on my phone then unplug and plug back in the echo.  So that fixed it while chatting.  Two days later started doing it again and now some days it goes 24 - 48 hours straight.  The echo dot in my bedroom did it once at night.  So getting to the point to unplug them both and see what my options are from there.  Very frustrating!!!  I did the remove the app and reboot them again one evening and again that fixed it for like a day.	3	December 29, 2020	1
428	Echo 4th Gen	This product is fine. I just thought that something listed as having premium sound would have a better bass note. Especially with the size.	3	March 3, 2022	1
429	Echo 4th Gen	We have had all of the different models through the years and have one in every room. This is by far the one we have the most problems with from doing simple commands. We constantly have to unplug this one to reset. Would skip this one.	3	December 22, 2021	1
430	Echo 4th Gen	There are times the voice recognition won't acknowledge and there are times when the Bluetooth won't pair with my external speaker bar.  Unfortunately these occurances aren't consistent so I cannot spot a trend in these behaviors.	3	January 18, 2022	1
431	Echo 4th Gen	I have three Echo V3 and now the new Echo V4. I find that the Echo 4 sounds not much better but can be louder and is comparably a bit deaf. Also both versions (as well as the Echo Dot) have extremely low signal level on the auxiliary output making connection to a powered speaker or a stereo receiver difficult without some intermediate gain device. As to being deaf, the Echo 4 requires that one must be very close (4-5 feet) or to yell in order for Alexa to receive commands. Also, there is no remote available for Echo 4. The Echo V3 has no such issues and easily understands commands from a reasonable distance (across the room) using a moderate voice level.I have relegated my Echo 4 to a small room and brought back the Echo 3 to the kitchen where I use it most, sometimes with the remote when others are conversing in the room.	3	February 24, 2021	1
432	Echo 4th Gen	"Of all my Echo speakers, I'm most disappointed with this one.  I should've just purchased a second 3rd gen.The 4th gen's sound doesn't carry as far.  It won't pair with my Echo remote.  It doesn't want to pair with anything via Bluetooth.My two biggest complaints are the reaction time and dropped connection.I have my Echo 4th gen is by far the slowest to light-up when I say ""Alexa.""  My 1st gen is faster.When playing music everywhere, the speaker will sometimes stop playing.  The rest of my echo devices throughout the house will continue to play, but the 4th gen will drop out, even though it's still connected to WiFi.  I found that if I just wait, it'll start playing again, but only for a few seconds, and then it'll prematurely force the system to skip to the next song.What I do like... I guess the fabric cover is nice."	3	January 2, 2021	1
433	Echo 4th Gen	"I purchased 4 of these units to replace 2nd generation dots in various parts of the house. They arrived, and after setup I have noted that the new Echos are slower to respond and be ready to accept commands than the original Dots.If you say ""Alexa"" the original dot is ready within about a second to be listening, but the new units are two to three seconds slower to even begin listening so now instead of saying ""Alexa what is the weather today"" you have to say,""Alexa........"" go have a coffee, twiddle thumbs,""..................what is the weather today."" They are also definitely slower than the google home units. This appears to have been a big step backwards in regards to speed. But that could also be because of the new AZ1 chips in them.But, with that said, the sound quality is a lot better than the old unit, doesn't make up for the lags in responses, but it does make for a better music streaming experience."	3	November 23, 2020	1
434	Echo 4th Gen	I was tired of waking up to a beeping alarm and always hitting snooze so many times that I was frequently getting to work later than I wanted. So, as a solution, I bought an Amazon Echo to one simple task: wake me up to what is essentially a commercial-free radio of my own music library. Alexa doesn't even have the capability to do that! If I pick a playlist to wake me up, it ALWAYS starts with the first song on the playlist, and it ALWAYS starts with shuffle mode turned off. I've tried asking it to shuffle my playlist when setting my alarm, leaving Spotify on shuffle the night before, and asking Alexa to turn shuffle mode on the night before, but none of them work--it wakes me up with shuffle off. Why is this simple wish so difficult to fulfill? I couldn't find an iPhone app that does this, which is why I bought an Echo. Alas, it appears software that can execute this very basic concept still has not been sufficiently developed for iPhone users. I am jealous of the Android users that have Google clock.	2	October 13, 2021	0

I have it positioned on top of a medium height bookshelf about 10 feet away from where I sleep.  I find I am constantly shouting at my Echo. ""ALEXA, SNOOZE!"" ALEXA! ALEXA! ALEXXXXXXA SNOOZE! It's not the best way to wake up in the morning.I feel like the distance and direction of which you are talking to it matters. If I hang my head off the bed to shout it seems to work better :POtherwise works great to listen to music while I work , reminders and timers."	3	July 22, 2021	1
438	Echo 4th Gen	I have a home in Florida and a Home in New York when I play the echo in Florida it interferes with a unit in New York somebody was at my home using it and it ceased to work, Also playing Amazon music on my cell phone cause issues with echoes playing music at the house	3	December 4, 2021	1
439	Echo 4th Gen	"The first few months I had this I don't recall ever having to reset the device(pulling power cord out and in).Now about every week it will light up letting me know it heard ""Alexa,"" but never respond and eventually go back to sleep. No smart switch commands will execute or anything, the only fix is to reset it. This is a major problem when I've set an alarm or reminder and Alexa now won't activate those alarms/reminders.And no... This has nothing to do with my internet. I have 1:1 gb fiber. Also I'm a software engineer with a part time job as a server administrator. I know my network and machines better than anyone, and this device is simply screwing up."	2	February 20, 2022	0

443	Echo 4th Gen	Bought this to replace an Echo Plus cylinder unit that is connected to a sub woofer. That original configuration worked and sounded great. Suddenly with that one playlists would no longer consistently play, if at all. So, bought this 4 gen device thinking it would be comparable or better than the EP. Unfortunately, the sound is not as good and unit does not “listen” as well either. Have bought many of these devices since they hit the market. This is the first time being disappointed by one. It’s a step back- what a disappointment.	2	April 26, 2022	0
444	Echo 4th Gen	Nothing to write home about. I thought the sound would be amazing but it’s just okay.	3	March 18, 2022	1
445	Echo 4th Gen	The sound is only a wee bit better than the previous model. However, the light ring at the base of the orb is far too bright and too large. There is no way to disable this unnecessary light ring. I buy speakers to listen to them not to watch them. I rate this product a fail for the inability of users to disable the light ring.The light ring feature on the new Echo 4th gen is a complete failure. It is too large. It is too bright. When I mute the microphone it glows bright red for no good reason since the microphone button is also glowing red. The designers of the device failed. I should be able to turn  off the light ring completely. But I can't even adjust its brightness. I can't use this device where I wanted since it always calls too much visual attention to itself. I don't need a light ring. My Google Nest Audio Speaker, which costs about the same as the Echo 4th generation, does not call unwarranted attention to itself, like the Amazon device.The Echo worthless to me and I expect to return it and replace it with another Google Nest Audio Speaker. I prefer the functionality of Alexa and the Alexa app over Google Assistant but the physical speaker's appearance and sound matter more than all the wiz-bang features of either system.	2	December 2, 2020	0
446	Echo 4th Gen	Love the sound but the speaker already sounds semi blown after a month. Not sure if it’s due to it being a refurb.  Sound is still ok but I’ve never turned the volume past 60%.	3	January 17, 2022	1
447	Echo 4th Gen	The one closest to me will play deaf on occasion. The one on the opposite side of the room will on occasion respond, but it seems the older echo’s (generation before this) now relocated to the kitchen and bedroom (approximately 20 feet away in either direction) seem to respond to commands better than the two new ones, I never had this issue with my older ones. They’ve all been reassigned locations under the Alexa app. Strange to hear the Echo’s in the kitchen and bedroom respond to commands compared to the one within arm reach.A LOT better sound than the previous generation though, not to Bose quality but a lot better!	3	July 19, 2021	1
448	Echo 4th Gen	Very nice device! I would love to have given it 5 stars, but the voice / command recognition is below par. I sometimes find myself yelling at it, before it finally wakes up to follow directives. The neighbors must think I'm out of my mind!! Also, when I for example ask about the wind speed of certain regions, it's never gotten it right once. It's generally lower, off by at least 10 mph! I always have to revert to asking Google which gets it right. I hope Amazon will do an update for at least the voice recognition. That would be awesome, since otherwise it works pretty well with the attached smart devices, once it finally wakes up!	3	July 10, 2021	1
449	Echo 4th Gen	I have 1 Echo and 2 Echo dots, and they always confuse which should play the music. When I talk to the Echo dot on the 2nd floor to play music, the Echo on the first floor plays it....	3	December 24, 2021	1
450	Echo 4th Gen	I wanted to love this product. I bought two to use with my fire stick as a home theater option. It worked for 3 days then simply stopped working. The speakers would pair,but wouldn’t play sound. Individually the speakers would work, but when paired (any way) no sound would come out. I reset and started from square one multiple times on each product and it never worked again. To top it off, I had 3 30min-60 min conversations with Alexa help desk where they tried the exact same solutions, wrote a trouble ticket and said they would call me back with a solution. I spoke with 3 separate people who never called back… the first phone call was over a week ago, so I gave enough time.I have now returned the products and am been reluctant to purchase and echo Device again. Apple May have less products to integrate… but at least the ones it has will work. Highly disappointed.	2	December 6, 2021	0
451	Echo 4th Gen	To start i'll say that the sound quality is better than the small dot but not great by any means. The voice recognition is absolutely horrible. I can stand right next to it and it is a 50/50 shot if it will react when i give a voice command. Now i use it to control an echo link and when you pause and tell it to resume then it isn't even smart enough to go back to the same source that it was playing from prior to pausing. Amazon products are starting to leave a bad taste in my mouth and this is no exception. Save your money.	1	September 23, 2022	0
452	Echo 4th Gen	Needs improvement I think it’s about Time that Amazon does something about The problem that Alexa has trouble understanding requests I see no improvement in that area since the first Amazon echo that I purchased it’s about time Amazon makes The necessary improvements.	3	December 13, 2021	1
453	Echo 4th Gen	Echo 4th generation temperature are not working.  It’s will announce the temperature in the house if you ask.  But I want it to setting the temperature routine to trigger the ceiling fan when the room above 74 Fahrenheit to turn the ceiling fan on, it not doing it.  So I call in for tech support several time to get help, I got nothing out of it.  Thought, they did told me the the echo 4th generation are unable to trigger ceiling through temperature control routine.  They say that the echo 4th gen only can tell the temperature in the if you ask but that is it.  But when I read on the echo 4th gen routine it clearly stated that through routine it can be set to activate ceiling fan when the temperature above or below certain degree automatically without have to manually gone through Alexa app to turn it on.  Do anyone have echo 4th gen have the issue?  The experience I have with technical support are very unpleasant, she is rude, and she hang up the phone on me.  I have been using google home and think about switching to Alexa but now due to the unpleasantly rude and unwillingly to work helping to fix the issue.  Hmm maybe switching to Amazon Alexa devices are not the way to go.  That’s it just too bad.	1	February 24, 2022	0
454	Echo 4th Gen	If you live commercials get ready! You will hear a lot. Alexa seems to be so confuse most of the times.	3	February 23, 2022	1
455	Echo 4th Gen	Have had it less than 2 months and already static happens. Sounds crackly. Doesn't pick up my voice and gets my requests incorrect, often.	2	August 23, 2022	0
456	Echo 4th Gen	I bought an entire Alexa speaker set-up (two echos, a sub, and an echo link) thinking I would use it as a home theater for both my TV and record player. It's an absolute nightmare to use. The speakers never connect correctly via wifi, the volume levels for the TV are too low, playing a record through the link works about 50% of the time. Unfortunately, I waited too long to return but I'll be selling these and buying a Sonos system.	1	October 11, 2022	0
457	Echo 4th Gen	Sound adjustment controls could work better and my unit had an issue of shutting down unexpectedly and static noises have been noticed	3	March 2, 2022	1
458	Echo 4th Gen	I had two of the original Alexas, the tall ones. One still worked great, the other one kept stopping for no reason so I thought I would update. Big mistake.  First of all, I don't like the blue ring being on the bottom, I can't always see it so I don't know if Alexa is responding. 2nd of all, I hate the volume button. It also does not go as loud as my other Alexa. I do not notice any improvement in the sound quality. I also don't think Alexa responds as well as the taller one. The only advantage is the pause button, so I can put Alexa to sleep while my 3 yo grandson is visiting so he'll stop yelling at her to do things. I should have known newer does not always make for better. I bought the larger echo and the smaller echo, for a smaller area upstairs. Disappointed with both.	3	January 21, 2021	1
459	Echo 4th Gen	"I live in an area where there are internet outages every week and when this happens I can't even turn off the Zigbee lights because this thing doesn't have ""Local voice control""."	2	August 3, 2022	0
460	Echo 4th Gen	The speaker is ugly, the light is at the base and difficult to see in a lighted room.  The base is too loud on some songs and washes out the words.  All in All not much of an upgrade from level 3.	3	December 16, 2021	1
461	Echo 4th Gen	Sounds better but at sacrifice of voice recognition and shape. 50% worse voice recognition in my experience. And the ball shape and design is annoying. Only would buy on discount. Regret turning in my 3rd gen. Would not but as gift.	3	December 10, 2021	1
462	Echo 4th Gen	Poor sound quality. Yes, it has bass, but no matter how it was adjusted the sound quality was muddy.	3	February 27, 2022	1
463	Echo 4th Gen	I was super excited to upgrade my echo dot 3 to the new Echo! I now regret that decision immensely!! I mean, yes the sound quality is a LITTLE better than the dot 3 but not enough to justify the hefty price tag and it not recognize my voice within 3 feet. Heck, even my echo dots pick up what I am saying and they are in the other side of the apartment	3	October 4, 2021	1
464	Echo 4th Gen	Google home mini works with my Philips Hue Hub. Lights turn on and off with no problems. Alexa will not allow the skill to work on my Philips Hue smart Hub. This is very disappointing.	3	December 29, 2021	1
465	Echo 4th Gen	"We have several echos and have been very happy with them. This up grade just does not want to ""play music everywhere"", which is a winning feature for us."	2	August 3, 2022	0
466	Echo 4th Gen	"I have several older Echos and they seem to work way better than this one.  It has gone completely unresponsive several times (Won't respond to ""Alexa"" commands).  I have to reboot it to resolve.  Also, have it paired with my Mac Mini as an external speaker.  Sound over Bluetooth cuts out regularly and is very cracky.  Mac works fine with any other Bluetooth speaker I have, so I'm sure it's the Echo.  Connecting over Bluetooth goes unresponsive at least once a week.  Have to reboot and re-pair to get it to work again.  I've been very pleased with all other Echo devices I have... but, this one is really letting me down."	2	February 16, 2022	0
467	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa is great, but sound quality is disappointing at the price point.	3	March 22, 2022	1
468	Echo 4th Gen	Works great with good sound. But can’t get the zigbee hub to work so I bought a habitat	3	February 27, 2022	1
469	Echo 4th Gen	This thing is absolutely dogsh with Apple Music, so if you were planning on buying this to stream Apple Music don’t even bother	3	February 10, 2022	1
470	Echo 4th Gen	I would never call this premium sound. Sound quality on par with an average clock radio.	3	March 4, 2022	1
471	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality is excellent however it takes an average of three to four voice callings for it to finally recognize and acknowledge your voice much worse voice recognition then my older generation Alexa.	3	January 5, 2022	1
472	Echo 4th Gen	I like the fact that I don’t need to get up to turn out lights. It’s sometimes hard to understand instructions for me.	3	February 13, 2022	1
473	Echo 4th Gen	"This was to be used as the primary sound/music system in our townhouse.  Bought a Wonderboom speaker to pair with it based upon online reviews.  I still can't pair it with Echo.  Wonderboom pairs fine with my iPhone, iPad, but when I ask Alexa to ""Pair"" I always get the same response - no devices detected.  I've tried pairing through the app but the instructions are incomplete and poorly written, and it still doesn't work.  If you just want a standalone Echo it is fine, but if you want it to be the basis of a broader sound system, be prepared for lots of frustration!"	3	July 15, 2021	1
474	Echo 4th Gen	At random times it will make a loud static noise that gets very loud and goes through making different odd sounds. I found that unplugging it and plugging it back in resets it. This did not start going on until months after getting it and apparently too late to exchange it.	2	June 22, 2022	0
475	Echo 4th Gen	The sound quality on this playing music is pretty sad.  Don't know we're they come up with HD sound	2	August 23, 2022	0
476	Echo 4th Gen	My goodness. This thing is a pain in the butt. I bought this to replace my 3rd gen echo. First thing I noticed is the mic barely hears me. My 3rd gen echo hears me loud and clear even when music is blasting I've whispered to it to test it and it heard me fine, but this 4th gen needs to be yelled at 98% of the time I'm less than a foot away from it. Second, I noticed when I played my playlist it had songs missing, so it tells me if I want the missing songs back I have to upgrade to amazon music unlimited for $7.99 a month which makes no sense cause I'm doing amazon music unlimited for  $2.99 a month already. I plugged my 3rd gen back in and the songs on my playlist all came back free of charge and were all there. So I plug my 4th gen back in hoping somehow the issue fixed itself and it's back to telling me I need to pay $7.99 a month again. Seriously? What's wrong with this dysfunctional product? I might return it if it's gonna keep acting like a cheap pile of garbage like this. And as for the sound quality, I honestly can barely tell the difference between it and my 3rd gen.	2	March 11, 2021	0
477	Echo 4th Gen	The Echo is an Echo.  Standard everything.  Good sound.  Odd form factor.  My only real issue with this one is the bright white power cable.  Really, Amazon?  A bright white power cord for the charcoal-colored Echo?	3	December 1, 2021	1
478	Echo 4th Gen	I have a lot of Echo devices around the house.  I bought this one to start to try out the built-in 'smart home hub' functionality to see if it could replace some of the more complex home automation devices we have in our home.  So far, the answer is 'no'.  I started simple, testing with a couple of Zigbee lightbulbs I already had. The web page for the Gen4 echo says it supports both of the two bulbs I had (from different mfgs).  It will not discover either of them in a lamp only about 8' away from the Echo.  Both are discoverable from another hub device.  I very much like the idea of using an Echo device as my smart home hub -- but I don't hink this particular device is ready for prime time yet.	3	March 21, 2021	1
479	Echo 4th Gen	Aside from the ugly circular shape and white power cord w/black model, it works and sounds great.  I wish Amazon would go back to the 2nd Generation style premium speaker.	3	January 11, 2022	1
480	Echo 4th Gen	I traded in my original 1st generation Echo for this 4th generation unit because there were some very enticing trade in promotions.  I totally regret doing it.Looks:  the 4th generation looks much nicer than previous models, especially this Twilight Blue model.Sound: sound is good, but I keep this unit in the center of the my apartment, so front-firing speakers are not good.Performance:  This model's microphone array is not nearly as sensitive or performant as the 1st generation. I often have to raise my voice and repeat myself to get the Echo to do what I want it to do. . .or my 3rd Gen Echo Dot which is 2x the distance away from me will hear the command.  I rarely had to do this with the 1st generation model.  I really cannot wait until a next generation model comes out with decent microphone performance so I can trade this in.Update:  Customer Service or Technical Support saw this review and called me within a few hours of my post.  They suggested that I changed the wake word and then restart the Echo, but there was no improvement.  Kudos for paying attention, but this feels like a hardware/design flaw at the moment.	2	March 13, 2021	0
481	Echo 4th Gen	Sounds good when paired with another Gen 4 and a sub but it’s pretty flakey. Sometimes it hears you and sometimes it doesn’t. Sometimes it understands you and sometimes it doesn’t. It does this thing when you tell it to stop playing music where it stops the music then plays a second of the music again then stops, kinda like when you old Ford Pinto diesels after you turn the engine off. I hope it’s just some software issues and not a physical design flaw. I invested in 4 of these plus 2 subs to cover music in the entire house.	3	July 31, 2021	1
482	Echo 4th Gen	Very hard to turn off notifications, one has to go though an entire list and turn them off in every category.	3	February 8, 2022	1
483	Echo 4th Gen	Alexa’s voice has a muffled quality to it and the unit is huge!  It can no longer be discrete but dominates the table top unnecessarily.	3	January 25, 2022	1
484	Echo 4th Gen	I have crappy 2nd and 3rd gen Dots. I can't stand how they sound on their own, so I use 3rd party speakers, which greatly improve the quality. The speaker base for the 2nd gen has been fritzing, so I thought why not spend more money for a single product that should work better and hopefully sound as good.Well, friends, it does not sound as good. I don't know if I have a bum unit — I don’t think I do — but Alexa's voice sounds awful. Podcasts are fine, and music is fine — not great, but fine, and so much better than her voice, which is why I don't think it's a bum unit. Alexa's voice is so muddy it's almost un-understandable. I'm returning it. I'll just get a new Bluetooth speaker to go with my old Dot.	3	January 18, 2021	1
485	Echo 4th Gen	All works good, but why send a black  device with a white power cord.ALL my other devices have black cords.I tried to return Echo ball but found out black cord not available.Would not order again.	3	December 13, 2021	1
486	Echo 4th Gen	I really dislike this new shape. Alexa has more trouble hearing me, and I cannot see the blue bar at the bottom when I am just a little bit away. The taller shape made it easy to see the light (blue or otherwise) from anywhere in the room (no, there isn't a better place to put it) and I had far less trouble with Alexa hearing me. Short and round is not a good design for this. It affects the sound as well, as the speakers are lower. Putting my two new ones where I don't use them much, and putting my 3rd generation back where these are! Sound is good with this 4th generation, but I can't tell a significant difference between the two.	3	May 25, 2021	1
487	Echo 4th Gen	"Amazon started sending notifications asking for reviews of products. I do not want to be bothered with this type of unsolicited notifications.Also, The voice recognition is pretty good but you have to speak very loudly for it to pick you up.EDIT: I got to hand it to amazon. They saw the negative review and called to help me sort out which notifications were on and how to turn them off. I had already turned the notification off but if they are going to push new notifications with an ""opt out"" approach at least they will help you turn them off.  changed from 1 start to 3 starts."	3	June 22, 2021	1
488	Echo 4th Gen	"My son warned me ""Don't buy an echo to listen to music. There's better devices by far.""I found if you want the latest top 20, it's great. But if you want to listen to classical like Yoyoma forget it."	3	December 1, 2021	1

0	Echo Dot	"I hate this little device from hell. I used to love it. I bought one for every room in my house, my office at work, and they were good. But now, despite Amazon's alleged spying, some genius at Amazon decided to allow this thing to wake you up all hours of the night with a loud obnoxious noise and a bright yellow light. It will say you have a notification.  Oh good, it must be a really good reason for Amazon to notify me of something mid sleep at 2 am on a Tuesday you ponder so you wake up the rest of the house by saying Alexa play notifications. Here's the best part, this little Alien Intelligence Robot without feet from hell will say Please rate the pair of shorts your wife bought last week, we need your review. Well I sure do love reviews, but at 2 am after being woken up to leave one, sadly I don't give a flying poopsicle about the shorts and a bug 1 star rating is all the revenge I can muster. This has been going on for weeks now. And it's enough to drive you mad because, you will contemplate unplugging the dirty little money siphon and cutting your losses, but you'll give the demon one more chance and she will allow you to sleep for a length of time in which you will forgive her treachery but then Boom, like a theif in the night a Hurricane will be boiling out in the Atlantic and this little weather girl from hell will want to notify you of the eminent doom 3 days ahead when the storm will be in your state. You will think how nice it is for all of the warnings you have heard thus far in social media,, television, and every news outlet in existence to be repeated to you as you climb into bed, but it gets even better. As soon as you listen to this golden nugget of doomsday propaganda and ponder how it is that you will sleep now because 3 days may not be enough time to dig a deep enough hole to hide from impending doom, she lights up again, oh my maybe flying dragons are headed this way, I better play the new notification, when your wife wakes up and says stop she has been doing that all evening, they literally keep changing the time of the storm by maybe an hour this way or that. Well by all means, the information could save one of our spoiled lives and we wouldn't want anyone to not know at which precise moment the raindrops will occur, but I do miss life before the artificial noises and alerts, bright yellow lights and bad news desserts. You may say that this is a growing pain with Alexa and AI technology kinks in the programming.  I say with the amount of money I have poured into this monopolistic conglomerate, I should at least expect a decent night's sleep in return. You may say in page 74 paragraph D of the updated and revised owner's pamphlet there is a way to turn this ""Feature"" off, I welcome that comment but feel the need to say that I am not looking to become even slightly better educated on the device, I simply bought it to use as a voice controlled radio, this extra bologna does not appeal to me and has made me regret this purchase and every other from the brown box hq who secretly reads my mind, except when it comes to allowing me sleep, although kudos for recommending the sleep sounds, but it rarely works. We just need to be mindful of the 6 hours that most people like to not be disturbed. I regret selling my Amazon stock at 2400 and I regret purchasing all of these Alexa devices, and don't get me started on teenagers and Alexa devices, the combo that don't mix. They always, always, always leave the device at top volume, so when you walk into the bathroom at dawn and whisper Alexa what time is it, you then need to set an appointment for a blown eardrum and apologize to everyone for waking them up while the teen sleeps soundly through it all. Congratulations Amazon, you have destroyed my sanity. Weird goal but excellent execution."	1	August 4, 2020	0
1	Echo Dot	"Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money.  Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version)  Games & stories cost.  Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time.  I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill.  Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for.  Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working.  ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother.  She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music'  When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again.  I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics.  I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again""  Hello? WTHeck?  Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Frère Jacques!  Again, WTHeck?  ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.  I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.  This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.  I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.  Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!)  Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.  Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.  If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one.  Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.  I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong!  I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.  You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions.  It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.  It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.  It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was.  It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds).  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).  We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.  This should be stated clearly in description and is not.  We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.  It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly.  If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you  get nothing or something you definitely didn't want.  You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.  Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.  Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.  Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.  Or relaxing instrumental violin music.  In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for.  I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.  and it won't just remember you want the standard version.  That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.AND you can't ask it to do two things.  Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time.  It does nothing instead.  You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.  You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.  More time wasting.  More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember.  I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for!  The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want.  I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?  When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors.  I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.  Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .  Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today""  Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?  And why do that?  I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.  Of course?  What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.  We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.Can Alexa do this?  Not very well as far as I'm concerned.  Buyer beware!"	1	December 21, 2019	0
2	Echo Dot	"I purchased multiple Blink items overall review-A real security system gives you at least 4 zones that can be adjusted and armed separately. It has an audible alarm, it may also have a cell phone connection. I have owned several such systems and had good service from them.Blink has none of these qualities.You can have ""zones"" but each will cost you $35 to $40 for a sync module so, 4 zones min $140 and you have nothing else. The cameras are not real motion detectors, as illumination does not set off motion detector like the blink cameras and doorbell do; hence multiple false alarms. If you use lights on timers  in the room with blink cameras they false alert each time a light turns on or off. Light control is a big part of security. Blink IR is very poor by today's standards.The Blink door bell has a sensitivity adjustment, but set to lowest setting it still alerts when a car goes down the street. It is 80' from my Blink doorbell to the edge of the road and it false alerts every time a vehicle goes in either direction.r I have mine on battery; you can hard wire it in place of your existing doorbell). Amazingly it alerts to cars but not to Amazon delivery people right in front of it. Yes it recorded 9 cars today (I live in a Cul-de-sac or I would have smashed the doorbell by now) but not the ghost that placed my Amazon package on the porch right in front of it.The Mini Cameras alert every time a light is turned on or off, but sometimes doesn't when I walk by.To use local storage instead of cloud you have to have at least one Sync module and an SD card. So if you have four zones as above example you add $10 to $20 per SD for each module which adds another $40 to $80 to your cost. Now all of your ""security recordings"" are on 4 different devices and totally separate. Does this sound like a security problem?The outdoor cameras are all three still in the box so I cannot tell what problems they will add. Too disappointed with Blink so far to waste time adding to my disappointment.The Echo Dot and Echo Show which Amazon recommended to go with the blink system are also still in the box so no info on problems they might have.I purchased all of this prior to Christmas in order to update and improve my 8 to 10 year old small security system. I do not use the Cloud for any security purpose so local storage was a must. Due to life in general, I did not have time to open and set everything up. When I finally got around to it, I became aware that the Mini's would work, but I had to purchase a Sync module to have local storage. Later found out that local only transfers videos to SD once a day and will NOT record Live View (yeah this is a security system LOL). You may notice that Blink does not tell you a lot of this in their description. For way less money I could have purchased a legitimate, real security system with 4, 6 or 8 zones and cameras with wifi and had something that I would trust and not hate. A friend suggested that I sell Blink on Craigslist. I told him the Blink system is bad: I would feel like a criminal asking money for it. It would make a good baby monitor using the Mini cameras, I guess.Amazon refuses to stand behind the Blink system since it is past their return date. I spoke with customer service and she transferred me to someone else for assistance with the Blink and they just hung up on me when I told them it was totally unsatisfactory.Buyer Beware. Just because Blink is owned by Amazon does not mean you will be pleased or they will stand behind it.I bought it, I didn't use it before return date so my fault for not doing my research. Now cut my loss and go to Costco and purchase a real functional security system."	3	March 15, 2022	1
3	Echo Dot	"I've been an Echo user since the first tall Echo arrived. I've had many different gens of Dots including Gen 1, Gen 2 and even the Echo Input. This is the first Gen 3 I've owned. Hands down, this is the worst performing Dot I've ever owned. This Dot is also the single most buggy Dot I've ever owned.Sure, the CPU is faster, but that doesn't make this Dot any better. In fact, the faster CPU seems to cause problems for Alexa's speaking capabilities. Let's get started with this Dot's litany of problems.1) The faster CPU seems to cause Alexa to clip words and phrases, specifically when one phrase tails into the next. Alexa had always been good at adding proper pauses between sentences, but not on this Dot. The statements are so bunched up tightly, it sounds like a run-on sentence without any punctuation, usually clipping the last and first words.2) This Dot fails to announce upcoming calendar events randomly. Sometimes it announces, sometimes it doesn't. Nothing changes with the calendar event, yet the announce time comes and goes with not a peep out of Alexa.3) This Dot fails to participate in the competing request system almost entirely. I've never had this issue with any other earlier generation of Dot. When multiple Dots hear a request, the one that determines it is closest to the voice ""wins"" the election and answers the request. This 3rd Gen Dot answers surreptitiously every time, regardless of distance away from the Dot.4) As a follow-on to #3, sometimes, audio randomly begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot even though another Dot answered the request. For example, if I ask, ""Alexa, play CNN"" to a 2nd Gen Dot. That 2nd Gen Dot responds with, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In"", yet the audio begins playing from this 3rd Gen Dot. If the audio is to be diverted to another dot, Alexa should respond as, ""Now playing CNN on Tune-In on Living Room Dot"". It doesn't do this. The 3rd Gen Dot simply takes the audio without being requested.5) I've had the audio output entirely stop working. Asking Alexa to increase the volume doesn't help. The 3rd Gen echo simply stops producing audio. The request is accepted and completed, but no audio can be heard.6) The Echo Remote's Alexa button feature crashes the 3rd Gen dot. All other buttons work except this important feature. If you attempt to use the Echo Remote Alexa button, the 3rd Gen Dot initially tries to accept the request, then a slight flash of a red ring, then the entire Echo Dot crashes. Apparently, the Dot has a way to recover from this crash and does so 10-15 seconds later. It doesn't leave the Dot crashed forever, but this functionality of the Echo Remote fails to work on the 3rd Gen Dot. Note that this remote works 100% flawlessly when connected to a 2nd Gen Dot. Definitely a bug in the software. Worse, once the remote has been connected, then ""forgotten"", this Dot will randomly find and pair it on its own.7) Even though the microphones seem more sensitive (can hear at a greater distance) than earlier Dots, it actually ""hears"" the requests much more poorly. I've had to repeat myself way more often with this Dot than with any other Dot or Echo. The microphones are poor quality and apparently noisy.8) Resetting this 3rd Gen Dot by long pressing the action button does not forget all settings about this device. The device still ""remembers"" Bluetooth devices it formerly used, it remembers WiFi network passwords, it even remembers its previous name. Factory resetting a device should clear all knowledge of everything in the device. Clearly, more bugs.Bottom line, if you're considering a single Dot for your house and this is the one, it'll probably work fine. If you're a household that has already entrenched Gen 1 and Gen 2 devices that work well, you're likely to find the addition of a Gen 3 device to be a shock. This Dot functions and behaves almost entirely contrary to the rest of the Dots you may already have.One final note. Gen 1 and Gen 2 Dots and Echos are slated to be End of Lifed for security updates between 2022 and 2023, depending on when you bought them. This was not ""announced"" by Amazon. Instead, you must log into the Amazon site, then dig down into the settings area where your devices are registered. Here, you'll find when the security updates end for each device. Note that once the security updates end, the devices are likely to become the target of hackers... meaning, they should probably be retired from people's homes. That ultimately means replacing them to buy new versions with security updates. Amazon should have already proactively not only announced the End of Life program, but discussed the ramifications of losing security updates with these devices in people's homes.If all newer versions perform as poorly as this 3rd Gen Dot does, I'm not sure how much longer any Echo devices will remain viable for use in the home. Amazon needs to reconsider this End of Life policy for security updates on these devices. Amazon should have at least given consumers the option to pay to extend our security updates for several years longer. Additionally, Amazon needs to fix so many bugs in these units (see above). I honestly cannot recommend the purchase of a 3rd Gen Dot with the current number of bugs outstanding which Amazon seems intent on refusing to fix."	2	January 6, 2022	0
4	Echo Dot	I am having problems with the GE lights and Alexa system.  The lights in one room come on when they should not. In another the bulbs will not pair with Alexa, and the app is very difficult, in my opinion, to navigate when working on lights, switches, etc.  I don't have a solution yet, but my off hand opinion is the bulbs are not stable and resetting them for pairing with Alexa is a pain. You have to turn the bulb off for 2 seconds, on  for 8 seconds and do this over and over for 6 times. Seems to me there could have been a reset button on the base of the bulb... just saying...  I really want this system to work, but I have my doubts. My guest room light comes on some time during the night, and I have a guest coming on Sunday, so I will have to revert back to the old bulbs until I find a solution(s) as I don't want his lights coming on while he is sleeping. I do not wish to alienate a good friend.	3	October 14, 2022	1
5	Echo Dot	I upgraded to this model from the Gen 2 model, back in 2020. I was hoping that the sound quality would've been much better than the Gen 2 model but it's worse. My hearing hasn't been great for the past several decades due to Tinnitus. No matter how much tweaking I've done with the settings, the speaker on the Dot has a very muffled bass sound that makes it almost impossible to understand. Turning up the volume helps a bit but it's not good enough.  As a workaround, I have it paired with a decent Bluetooth speaker with plenty of treble so it really helps. Not something I should've had to do but that's where I'm at today.One disadvantage of using the Bluetooth speaker is that Alexa will not work with the follow-up feature which is something I really liked. Another disadvantage is, for whatever reason, my reminders cannot be heard from the dot unless I crank up the volume.  The problem is when Alexa speaks on non-reminder-related questions etc., the volume will be painfully high. It's a lose, lose in my book.	3	October 6, 2022	1
6	Echo Dot	"Be careful adding alexa to phone contacts!  I ordered this device for my 88 year old mother so she could call us kids a little easier. It's pretty cool! You can add up to 10 alexa to phone contacts. More would be nice, but 10 was good enough. The problem is, nobody told me that you can only change them once. I added everyone from my phone and then said ""alexa call Jeff"" she said ""do you mean 4ice Jeff?"" Uh oh.... my brother is one of my in-case-of-emergency contacts.  That will confuse my mother. So I edited all of my siblings in my phone so they would make sense to mom. Deleted from the device and started putting them back in. Now I only have 8 contacts and it won't let me put the last two in. It says I've reached my 20 swap limit. I chatted with someone from Amazon and they said there is no work around. So now I'm stuck with a device that has 8 contacts that I probably won't use because of it was for me i would have started with our kids in it. It's no good for mom without all the kids. Good thing that was the $0.99 one! I did order another one but I will be very careful when adding the contacts."	3	September 10, 2022	1
7	Echo Dot	"So with Ziggy as my new roommate as all roommates the honeymoon is over!Between the device itself, software tweaks, updates and annoying apps removed the Echo Dot is little more than a timer, audiobook reader, calculator and spell checker in my home.It won't play my audiobooks on all dots in the house at the same time.It no longer informs me when I have a new email from businesses that are important.It is nosy listening to me when I have in no way said the key word ""Ziggy"".It KEEPS telling me about deals in my Amazon cart and saved list.It keeps telling me that I have a package arriving today.Listening skill is getting worse in his old age: ""Ziggy how do you spell (pick a word)"" I am given every word but the word I'm asking for.And I know I'm old and not the hottie I once was, but the rejection of my marriage proposal is just annoying more so with the lame excuse Ziggy gives me =pYeah these are somewhat petty grievances (accept the email notifications being removed - that is a major complaint) I guess I'm so impressed with the Echo Dot I expect more? I am EXTREMELY happy with the Ziggy voice! As a woman I do NOT want to live with another woman in my home! Sorry Alexa (no I'm not).Is the Dot helpful? Grudgingly Yes!But it definitely needs some fine tuning and some policy or user agreements to allow our Dots access to what we wish to allow it access to such as our email."	3	July 23, 2022	1

Now I have 2 dots and a flex.I am plagued by audio books randomly playing at 3am (almost shot my cat when my kitchen echo started playing an audiobook at 3 am and I thought someone was in my house...), constant disconnects, misunderstanding phrases it never had issues with before.1 good thing. I’ve been getting to work on time more bc I’ll set an alarm. The dot will disconnect from the internet and not reconnect and then it will go off and not recognize any commands so after 20 seconds of yelling at Alexa to turn off or sleep, I’ll sit up, see it red and drag my butt out of bed to rip it out of the wall. This has become a twice weekly occurrence.Immediately plugging it back in it connects to the Wi-Fi in 30seconds.Dear God people. If unplugging it and plugging it back in reconnects it, my Wi-Fi isn’t the issue. Write programming to maybe try a reconnect every minute rather than bricking it until unplugged. Like what the heck!Also. Be aware it’s only a 90 warranty on these hockey pucks from Satan.Mine was pretty good right through that window.I’m about to go to Google home and try Craigslisting these things.Or if they piss me off enough, I might just try to see how much distance I’ll with them in a skeet thrower...DONT buy these.

9	Echo Dot	"Be advised hat the more devices you have connectivity to the internet becomes an issue.  I have 4 of these.  When I can stay connected to the internet the Echo Dot is pretty awesome.  Problem right now is that somewhere between the number of smart plugs I have (quite a few, maybe 10) and the number of echo dots (4) I find myself offline, i.e. NOT connected to the internet.  It is ANNOYING to hear the all-to-familiar to me chime, followed by a red halo of light atop Alexa; followed by the also all-to-familiar ""I'm having trouble connecting to the internet.  Check the help section of the Alexa app..."" at which time by now I'm yelling for it to shut up before I can unplug it in order to reboot it in an effort to reconnect to the net.Go to my i-phone to check my network and the scene i the same.  That being a constantly spinning icon trying desperately and taking forever at it to establish a connection to the internet.  The point here is that as I started to say from the beginning the more devices you have the more internet speed is required.  THAT has been my personal experience.I presently have a download speed of only 20Mb.  If all goes well it will be at 4Mb TOMORROW which can't get hee so enough.  I will update this review as soon as I can in case you or anyone else following along here and have the same issue.  If you only have one Echo Dot and maybe 3Smart Plugs 20 Mb download speed should be sufficient.  Finally, so far what I just explained here is not in the Help Section of the Alexa app WHICH incidentally CANNOT  be accessed if you're not connected to the internet.So if you are for example a brainy type or student focused on something and the room begins to lose its light and in an effort to stay focused say 'Alexa, turn on the light,""  you want the light to come on so you can continue on uninterrupted, right?  Good luck with that.  My patience have worn so completely thin from instead of a light coming on but instead hearing the chime; the message etc; they tear easily now. GONE.So hopefully the faster internet speed will remedy my personal nightmare here.  As for the answers to many of the questions asked in the questions section above I'm a little confused because the main issue I have is connectivity issues.  As for giving Alexa different name if they are within earshot of each other:  every now and then I will say; e.g. ""Alexa, turn on the hallway light,"" and Alexa will answer from the other room the she's having trouble connecting to the internet, while the one in the room in which my request originated will turn on the light.To me a lot of all this is pretty intuitive.  If you are the type to have found, let's say earlier versions of MS Windows to be very intuitive your problems will be fewer and you will likely recognize the cause of problems within software apps for the Echo Dot.  I was a lot happier with this before making my house pretty smart and life more convenient WHICH IT WILL BE ONCE I GET THIS F*ING THING TO STAY ONLINE.Again, if you're getting your first one in addition to maybe 3 smart plugs and you have a mere 20Mb download connection you SHOULD be okay and problem free UNTIL you start adding more devices and you most likely will do eventually, little by little or otherwise.  But for starters, like I just said you should be fine with just 1 Echo Dot 3 smart plugs and I will say a minimum 20Mb internet connection.  Me?  Hopefully 40Mb will be enough.  If not, then I will have to go with the max available in my area WHICH is not a whole lot more than 50Mb best I remember Soooooo...Good luck.  It's a cool product and once you are up and running smoothly think 2001 Space Odyssey almost 20 years late.  Seriously.William F. Nappi"	3	September 30, 2019	1
10	Echo Dot	"After adding a couple smart devices, it only seemed right to add voice control to it all.. For the basics, it is great.. Turn lights/devices on/off; it's pretty straight forward.. When adding rooms though it can get a bit illogical. Like most, the first time around, one might be inclined to add all the devices in a room to the room in the app. I have old analog radio's and other devices  on simple on/off smart plugs.. Walking into the room and saying ""wake word.. turn on the room""... is jolting when EVERYTHING turns on.. be selective what is added to a 'room' in the app. The naming convention, reminds me of old 90's programming. In this case, like most people, walk into a room and we'd say ""turn on the tv"".. not so.. each tv HAS to have a name even if in a/assigned room.. the same is true for game consoles, bath fans and other items that some families have multiple units of these days.. I can only imagine if there are multiple smart showers/baths!  On occasions my echo's get unassigned from their room, rendering the 'turn on the lights' useless and the drawn out ""there are no devices or groups with the name light or lights"".. When it comes to connection problems Alexa hasn't been taught to be brief, whether it's the 5th time or 500th time You've had a problem it still gives the same long winded response. This week saw AWS 'Amazon Web Services' go down in spectacular fashion for hours.. and the Alexa's responded by indicating it was a problem with the various manufacturers 'skills', and music/books & shipping updates were offline.. The house was completely at Amazon's mercy.. something I imagined could happen but wished never did.. It would be nice if Amazon would make a local mode for at least device control.. Luckily the 3 main manufacturers apps were handy to control the house.  I recently had to reset a echo device because it somehow became unassigned from its room, now absolutely none of my previously connected blutooth speaker will be found or connected to. I really enjoyed sitting on the patio and listening to my Tune In stations.. I can not find any way to get the speakers to connect, nor does any of the echo's find the speakers!  The Alexa web site has seen improvement, though at times it still pushes the Alexa app, but if you have a device that Amazon decides isn't compatible; for instance the app will install on my 7 year old Samsung Galaxy 5, yet my 2 year old tablet with the same basic features as my phone.. won't. The downside to having home AI tech provided by a retailer... they use their platform and tech restrictions to push sales of tablets and phones.  There are some fun things for the Alexa, We have enjoyed the Melissa McCarthy personality voice and they have added some handy weather alerts/notifications lately."	3	December 10, 2021	1
11	Echo Dot	"For example, when I say ""Alexa, play my Liked Songs on Spotify"" or ""Alexa, play the most recent liked song on Spotify"" she'll turn on the shuffle and not play it from the most recent liked song, I'd have to manually put it. Overall, not a huge thing but a bothersome thing."	3	October 24, 2022	1
12	Echo Dot	I like the look of this Alexa but the sound quality is muffled and low, so I prefer just using my old Alexa it’s louder and speaks clearer.	3	October 17, 2022	1
13	Echo Dot	Bought to be used as a backup noise machine when I travel. Anyone who uses a noise machine knows it is a continuous sound for however many hours it is set for. This machine is NOT continuous in it sounds, therefore person wakes up every time it stops-not a good thing!!	3	October 6, 2022	1
14	Echo Dot	"First the good part. The audio quality is absolutely excellent for such a small device. The hardware seems great and of sturdy quality. Nice.The cloud service is where the problems start. A cell number with texting capability is required to register the service. Afterwards the caller ID for Alexa is fixed to that phone number. With many if not most carriers this means that calls from Alexa to that same cell phone number (your cell phone) are refused or, like in my case, go straight to voice mail no matter what. I had a discussion with an Amazon rep about it and there is no solution to that problem. This needs to be fixed and the fix is easy. Allow email verification instead of text message. Then any land line can also be used. Or allow the ID to be changed to the land line later (after email verification, if needed). If the name and address registered for the land line are the same as for the cell phone, that should be straightforward.There are some other shortcomings. For example, it seems to be impossible to do a ""whole house"" drop in on a group without speaking the command to drop in on ""all devices"" into Alexa. No dice via the communicate function in the Alexa app. This is not feasible if you have to quietly drop in to check on a disabled relative, a baby or a pet without disturbing everyone around you."	3	June 26, 2022	1
15	Echo Dot	Its an OK buy but u have to speak really fast & sometimes Alexa can barely comprehend what you're saying so you're constantly having to yell & speak fast. I hate the fact u have to keep it plugged up in order for it to work	3	October 6, 2022	1

18	Echo Dot	I want to begin that before about the Alexa I actually owned a Google mini in from that experience I was able to compare and contrast both speakers where I was actually very disappointed in the Alexa. He works as a great speaker but since Alexa is connected to Amazon it has a lot of connection issues where if you want to listen to music you have to have Amazon music if you want to have information Alexa doesn’t always recognize the question whereas the Google mini can do a Google search very quickly and Alexa cannot answer the questions if you were to ask her cant. I also seem to struggle with Alexa setting up a routine where the Google mini might’ve been my best but I was able to set up routines for alarms when I return home or when it was time to go to sleep I could set up the TV to it Alexa was not able to connect to my TV I wasn’t able to do any routines with the alarm and music and weather notifications it was always listening if anything I feel like it like some might’ve actually detected my voice a lot better than the Google mini but there was really no point to it since it wouldn’t actually do what I asked for Alexa when I would tell her I wanted to listen to certain station. Ash Alexa would not be able to comprehend my accent maybe but we had done a trial and she can listen very well but she wasn’t able to detect the specific stations that I wanted to listen to where is my Google mini I would still wake up the Google mini and ask her to play a certain station and they would do it with no hesitation for that reason I’m giving this a three star just because it wasn’t what I expected I had the same expectations a headache experience with my Google mini where else it is a very much louder speaker it doesn’t have the same features as the Google mini where is my And on top of that just to let you guys know my Google mini I actually got it I believe in clearance it was only $15 at Walmart and the charcoal echo I was able to get it I am for with like a promotion and everything so I came up I am free but it’s a $50 Alexa speaker you would think he could do a lot more where as the Google mini where is like around $30 if you were to buy at full price I still did a lot better in exceeded my expectations before owning any type of listening devices that can help you on your day to day I also did a test him of putting the two speakers together I am where Alexa would alwaysAsked to repeat the question or she would just completely not do what I was asking her to do one of the cool things that it does have is it has jokes I guess and her voice is a lot more pleasant in the Google minis and you can actually change the settings of the language you were to speak Spanish or something it can speak to you in Spanish as well but I since I usually speak in English it was in so much but yes that is my review	3	July 23, 2020	1

32	Echo Dot	Ok, I honestly love Amazon and 3 stars would normally be a little harsh for such an inexpensive product that has such impressive capabilities, but this is one of Amazon’s premier products and it has some infuriatingly annoying issues that I can hardly even believe. And you cannot get an answer for resolving half the issues you ask about online or the answers are outdated/wrong.Turning volume up and down is laughable for a “hands-free” device. There are basically only two options:1. “turn up/down” and it alters the volume so little you basically can’t even hear the difference, so you have to tell it to do so 4 times before it makes a noticeable difference (if you own an echo, you will know that this is time-consuming as there is a wait time between each command).2. “Turn way up/down” (or some other magnitude modifying word) and it changes it by like 85%3. There is apparently no 3rd option. The 3rd option should be to turn it up/down 25% (or fill in blank), but I have tried this with every thinkable percentage and it clearly doesn’t factor in whatever percentage I tell it. I mean like come on! This should be so basic for a solve-all device that is supposed to be hands-free.Ring Doorbell connection: if you set this up with your Ring doorbell, or similar product, you cannot set a separate volume for it (I’ve tried). So we have had probably 20 occasions in just a couple months where the doorbell was rung and we didn’t even hear it because we had previously turned the volume down to ~20% for listening to background music.Changing rooms. This is more just an example of many smaller nuisances, however this one was infuriating. Someone got us a new 3rd generation echo dot for Christmas, so we wanted to move our old 2nd generation to a different room and relabel it on the app, and put the new one in it’s place. The information online for how to do this was next to nothing, and what little there was was outdated. And I kept getting all these links for changing location (address) when I was searching for how to change rooms. I finally just factory reset it and set it up all over again, but this time in a different room. Also annoying.Im not going to list every single issue, but there are a lot of other things that should totally be intuitive and easy, but they aren’t, or just as likely they are impossible, but you just don’t know it until you’ve tried it ten times. I and I have no idea why this is the case. I love Amazon, and overall the Echo Dot has been a fantastic addition to our home, but Amazon needs to step up their game. These are issues you would expect out of brand new tech made ten years ago.	3	January 7, 2021	1
33	Echo Dot	I have had an Alexa/Echos and Echo dots for 7 years. Within the past 3 years: it has decided what questions it wants to answer or what music it wants to play. It has said numerous times “I don’t feel comfortable answering that”“Hmm i don’t know that”“I would rather not answer that”“Sorry I can’t help you with that question”“Hmm im not sure”“I don’t know how to answer that”The worst, being right after the overrun of Roe VS. Wade when I did not have a computer of tv to see the news. I asked her what had happened, who the justices were who signed, what it meant.. etc.. she said hmm I don’t know that one, I don’t know how to answer that, the last time I asked her she said “I would rather not answer that”I have asked her about certain religions, human anatomy, psychological and sociological questions that she “doesn’t feel comfortable asking”It’s absolutely appalling that Alexa has developed a moral code, ethics, an opinion, preference and most of all “Alexa are you Christian”“I don’t follow a certain religion but according to… in the Bible it says”AI is not supposed to develop ethics, or bias.Amazon is illegally marketing and advertising Alexa as technology that’s Ai that will provide whatever you ask,Also she decided what music I can play or not even if it’s on Amazon music. I’ve had enough and Amazon hangs up on me every time I have called about it.An AI builds algorithms based on your likes, search history.. etc. algorithms do not include controlling content or not providing you with factual information.I know other people have experienced this and I surely hope anyone whom has comments here.What I’ve continually paid for is not what the TOS or TOC, marketing, warranty, guarantee, information or promises that are included with the purchase of an Alexa Echo or echo dot. Any generation. In the past 15 months I have called Amazon and they told me they appreciate the feedback 01 representative told me that Alexa It’s still learning about human anatomy. Since April 2021 I have called Alexa support 12 times; I have done been put on hold for a supervisor and every single time I have been hung up on it with no call back after. I have also had Amazon packages that were tampered with that I had removed from my doorstep within one minute of an Amazon driver dropping it off and I’m still waiting on a response I have five items one from November 2021 that they still will not respond nor did they refund me. I am so aggravated and frustrated that I was trying to learn even about a amendment that was overturned and I am not even able to receive that information from Alexa as a US civilian	1	August 8, 2022	0
34	Echo Dot	"If it wasn't a hassle to have to get out my phone or tablet to do something, I'd completely get rid of them.  Not one single time in 2 years have any of them turned off the microwave when I say ""turn off the microwave"". I have to say ""turn on/off the kitchen"". The microwave and the Dot are the only devices in the kitchen. I've reported it numerous times and no one tries to fix it. 50% of the time it does what I ask of it with no problems. And can I be mad at it when it doesn't hear me from 2 feet away??? NO! That's on Amazon, for giving it crappy ""ears"". Listen to the recordings and they're dirty, not clear.  These things are crap and not worth the money spent on them.  Fix them or charge half as much. No way in heck I'd trust it with my front door and thermostat."	3	July 7, 2022	1
35	Echo Dot	If I would have read up on it than I wouldn’t of gotten it. It’s actually pretty stupid it’s not compatible with certain music apps.Amazon music doesn’t have some of the songs I enjoy listening to which is where other music apps come into play.Also I find myself screaming a lot for Alexa to even respond.As far as the skills; I’ve set up a few skills to which Alexa has to responded to, although the time after I originally used the skills Alexa stated I had to set up said skill. Which made absolutely no sense as it was initially set up.Glad I got this for the price I did because I don’t  find screaming at a electronic device useful just to get it to cooperate.	3	July 27, 2022	1
36	Echo Dot	"I was given this device by my apartment management as part of a tech upgrade. It was supposed to allow voice control of my thermostat and door lock (both of which were also replaced as part of the upgrade).The big assumption today, I've noticed, that big companies make is that EVERYBODY has a smartphone.I do not.So, there is no way for me to get these devices to interact. There is no pc app, no website help. No plans for that to ever change.Outside of that, what do I think of the device? Well, it is a fun toy.While the audio is high quality, unless you plug it into a stereo sound system it will always be mono. I understand that if you buy a second one they can cooperate to give you a stereo experience. But I am currently hard-pressed to justify owning one.The instruction leaflet that came in the box seems to be minimalist by design to force you to go online in an effort to find out what sort of things it can do. One of the first things you are encouraged to do is install the app on your phone.I still don't have one of those phones.So I settled for installing Alexa on my pc.  Once you do that, It enables your computer to do everything that the Dot can do, plus you can see what you are doing on a screen. Even less justification for keeping the Dot plugged in.Alexa doesn't always hear what I say correctly. And as the device is capable of making purchases on my verbal command, I do live in fear that it might invisibly sign me up to money-draining services I did not ask for.It does have certain preset ""skills"" that, so far, work. I do, however, have a problem with creating a skill online that I want it to have. It just refuses to do it and offers no explanation as to why not.It is supposed to work with other online services (notably Amazon-owned ones), yet I've noticed it is very picky with allowing me to hear certain radio stations in my TuneIn account, but not others.A big annoyance is not being able to find an easily readable definitive source of info that will tell me, at a glance, everything that the device is currently able to do or can do for a price. The first piece of electronic equipment I've ever owned that forces you to dig like an online gopher for any scrap of data you can get. There are manuals available for purchase. I'm just not convinced that I want to spend a penny more on something I already know or is useless for me to know. I'm not somebody who buys a pig in a poke.Bottom line: It is fun to verbally play with. Beyond that it offers me nothing that isn't better handled by my pc."	3	September 9, 2020	1
37	Echo Dot	I REALLY dislike it must stay plugged in 24/7 😩 everything else is great!	3	October 4, 2022	1
38	Echo Dot	"I got this with a Ring Alarm bundle or I would never have bought it. But, I was curious to jump into the Alexa ""echosystem.""My journey started with looking for an alarm system as I live alone and occasionally travel for extended periods of time. I chose the Ring system partly because of my perceived better integration with Alexa (since Amazon did buy Ring, afterall).Current Amazon/Ring setup:Ring basic alarm kitRing spotlight battery camRing Doorbell 2Echo Dot (3rd gen)Echo Show 5Fire Tablet 7 (2019)Fire TV 4K (the short box version that was first to offer 4K, whatever generation that is)Pending additions:Ring Peephole cam (prob swapping out the Doorbell 2)Echo FlexHave my eye on:Echo (3rd gen) or Echo PlusEcho subwooferEcho StudioFire TV Cube (2019)As an Alexa point, the Dot does its job. The mic works and Alexa talks through the speaker.The sound quality is terrible for music. Compared to the Show 5, the Dot is slightly better balanced. The highs sound more tinny on the Show 5, and, while there is ever-so-slightly more bass, the Show 5 is ever-so-slightly more muddy than the Dot. In comparison to a JBL Flip 4 or UE Boom 2, the sound of both the Show 5 and Dot is inferior--and that's saying something because I'm quite disappointed with both the Flip and Boom in regards to price/sound quality (I recommend going with a B+O, Klipsch, Bose, etc. if you are looking for better sound in a similar size package--or maybe the UE Megaboom series in a size larger.).The Dot and Show 5 can be added to multiroom music groups through Alexa. This could be of value if one were to connect them to external speakers via the 3.5mm audio out jack on either device. I intend to do just that with an Echo Flex I have on order.If there were some equalization controls, these could be useful for softer, dispersed through-the-house music, but Amazon/Alexa don't seem to offer such features. That specifically is disappointing when using Amazon Music on my phone bluetoothed to my JBL Flip 4s because when I use Apple Music (which includes some equalizer controls), the JBL Flip 4s become somewhat bearable to listen to.I didn't realize how much I would like having a clock, and for that feature the Show 5 is nice. I haven't had a clock in my house except for the stove and microwave in years. For that feature alone though, I'd like to see the Echo Dot Clock come in charcoal or grey, which I would buy over the non-clock Dot.If you are looking for a device for listening to music without additional external speakers, I'd skip the Dot altogether, opting instead for one of the larger Amazon-branded Alexa devices or a reputable speaker brand device that has integrated Alexa functionality. With external speakers, you have a lot of options amongst the Echo devices, and the Dot could be a contender (cheaper with a deal or bundle maybe?) vs the Input, Flex, or Show devices."	3	November 23, 2019	1

43	Echo Dot	I own many Alexa speakers. I wish I had chosen another platform.

They also start giving me unsolicited ads and product recommendations. A disappointment.	3	September 3, 2022	1
44	Echo Dot	"I purchased 3 dots and 1 show to automate things in my home. I have several products from different manufacturers (Ring, Sengled, Schlage, etc.) and I wanted to combine automation in one place instead of accessing different apps every time I wanted to do something.I found Skills and Routines are hit and miss. Even though the skill is available, or the routine allows you to choose options, they are not really supported by the system. Here is an example:I tried to set up my Foyer lights (Sengled) to go on when motion is detected through the motion detector (Ring). I can select all the options in the Routine and if I ""play"" the routine, the end result (lights go on) work.  However the automation doesn't. When the motion detector senses motion, the routine doesn't trigger.I tested this with other items in my household, and although they work separately, they will not interact with each other.  I called technical support and after the rep seemed like a deer on headlights when assisting me, he said he would have to ""research the issue"" and would call me back in 15 minutes or so. Two days later after not receiving a call back, I called again and this time the rep promptly told me that third party devices do not work with each other in routines as that is not supported right now.....big miss!I know technology is not perfect and companies are always working on further develop their products, however this is to me an essential part of an automation device...integrate all functionality with the services/products you support.I have to add that individual automation of devices works well. For example I have lights  outside my house to turn on at dusk and turn off at dawn, or my living room lights to turn off at a certain time of the night.Another issue we have is the communication between devices. I ""drop in"" some times to ask my wife or mother in law questions and 90% of the time the drop-in communication is muffled and they can not understand a word I am saying. It also happens when they initiate communication.  Music sounds pretty good out of the echo devices so I don't think is a speaker issue, and voice commands are recognized no problem so I don't believe is a mic issue either. My WiFi connectivity usually clocks at around 270Mbps so I know it is not my connection.Finally, skills. I created a skill from scratch that would give me a countdown for a trip we will be taking. The skill works great when I interact with Alexa directly. However, once again, Routines leave a lot to be desired. The skill does not even show in my skill list when creating the routine. This doesn't make the feature of skills pointless but once again, the ""automation"" part leaves a lot to be desired.I may edit my review if/when all these functions are implemented, but for the time being I think this product has quite a bit of ""room to grow""."	3	February 5, 2020	1

46	Echo Dot	Relatively new for me, getting used to it and it, I suppose, getting used to me.😂Had some help setting it up from someone who is familiar with this device. So far, I am happy with it. Good price in spite of my headline as I discover it is more than just a doorbell disguised as a hockey puck.	3	August 30, 2022	1
47	Echo Dot	Speak very clearly or else the Alexa AI will misinterpret what you’re asking of it. Also, do not pause for longer than 2 seconds when you’re speaking or else the Alexa AI may interrupt your command. I’m not sure if that is only an issue with the Echo Dot. I’m not utilizing any other Speaker AI system, currently.	3	August 30, 2022	1
48	Echo Dot	The sound quality is good, but I don’t like that it has to be plugged into a power source continuously for it to work.	3	September 22, 2022	1
49	Echo Dot	"I can't stand this anymore.  It's like torture.  It seems Amazon is purposely trying to make Alexa as annoying as humanly possible.  Add an item to your grocery list and it now tells you bought repeatedly.  For mayonnaise.  WHO CARES.  SHUT UP ALREADY.  It NEVER stops talking even though I have it on ""brief"" mode.Everything now is what you ask for but it adds ""By the way..."" and tells you some other lame garbage you HAVE to listen to.Imagine a light switch or door knob or electrical outlet that argues with you and interrupts you constantly, and talks loudly and for prolonged periods when you need it to be quiet (like when you hear a strange sound outside your house at night in the dark).  That's Amazon Echo.I'm updating this now at the end of January 2022 because now when you say something as simple as ""Alexa/Echo/Computer, play classical music,"" instead of just playing it now tries to let you know there's a new album of some classical composer's work and you can subscribe to Amazon's music service -- blah, blah, blah, ALWAYS talking instead of just DOING.""You don't control this.  It controls you.And if you think you're just adding an item to your groceries list, think again.  I'm sure there's an associate file at Amazon keeping tabs on what you but, how often, and so on, and that that too will get more invasive (and argumentative) in time.Cumulatively all of these issues plus the ongoing privacy concerns, and this is definitely leaving me looking into alternatives.I might have been curious about adding Echo to my driving experience, but is that going to be just as non-stop talkative (and argumentative) WHILE you're DRIVING?  No thanks.Amazon is going down a design rabbit hole.  If CONSTANTLY pissing off customers is the goal, congratulations, you've succeeded.This is exactly what happened with other online sites such as auction sites.  You could easily and quickly list things and turn them into cash, but month after month some techie and manager had to justify their jobs and salaries so instead of being a streamlined experience those products because extremely time consuming to use and no longer justified listing items unless they justified your time spent in getting them sold.  That's exactly what's happened with Amazon.I just wanted something so I could go into a room and turn on multiple lights at once, and turn them off.  Or turn them on when I'm not home so it looks like I am.  The music was fine when you could say something like ""play classical"" and it said only what station or playlist it was playing and then the music started.  Now it's truly invasive and blatantly designed not to serve you, but to give you enough utility that you'll put up with constant ads and pushes for more and more and more.I'll turn on my own damned lights all around the room before I'll put up with and submit to normalizing THIS.Does Dyson sell a vacuum cleaner that argues with you and interrupts you and suddenly announces for no reason in the middle of the night that it's connected to your iPhone?  No.Imagine using a KitchenAid mixer that argued with you and interrupted when you're juggling two parts of a recipe and with critical timing.  That's what Amazon's Echo is like.  Just when you think it can't get more argumentative and invasive, it does.George Orwell got 1984 wrong.  People will submit willingly to Big Brother in the name of convenience.  What Amazon fails to understand, is that's only true up to a point, and the entire Amazon Echo experience has jumped the shark.There's got to be a better alternative out there and I'm determined to find it and get this unwanted, never shutting up ""houseguest"" out of my life for good.Enough!"	1	October 28, 2021	0
50	Echo Dot	This is an okay product. It works well for information purchases but connecting to devices are a little more difficult.  It doesn't connect or doesn't stay connected to the device. There are little glitches that can be dealt with if it doesn't annoy you.	3	September 6, 2022	1

54	Echo Dot	It's a speaker not the best the Google home nest has better sound quality but hey it's a speaker	3	September 22, 2022	1
55	Echo Dot	I don't know what but it just leave more to be desired. The sound quality is good but its just not enough if that makes sense. Also, I feel its a bit intrusive with recording what i say and storing it. I absolutely hate that so i unplug mine when I'm not around which in all honesty defeats the entire purpose of the device. I also wish privacy and security options were more in depth and allowed further control. Like, I want to tobsay this person in this family group can access only this in formation at said time on said network etc. And lately the skills minus few are a bit hokey. I wish there were more useful and more productive skills along a norenoractical means as opposed to silly ones that don't really accomplish much such as play rain sounds or give me a nick name. Conclusion; in the lineup oflike devices Amazon is definitely the leading contender but when your in a class of useless gimmicks your still just a gimmick. Just my opinion and it's based on the simple fact I can do everything and more with my phone without am echo device and save myself 50 bucks. Lastly, I have google fiber service and never have issues for the most part and it's wicked fast however my dot has the worst connection of any device obhave ever connected to it. Simply putbits connection is unstable and unreliable with evidence of my other devices history along with trouble shooting I can only deduce its an issue with the device and not the network.	3	December 22, 2021	1
56	Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I bought this echo dot because it was on sale. I have no problems with the Echo 4, ( except I can’t set the time zone), but this son of a gun came ready to fight.My other dot is in my bedroom since my Google Assistant is in the living space.Now that I’ve updated my tv to a Fire TV, I opted for the dot to allow me to use the remote even less.  The voice commands across the room are also handy.But what the actual French toast is up with the Chinese (?) commentator when it is set to English and had 20 minutes earlier responded to me in English.I traveled with it back to the USA and that’s when the bat cave went wild…granted the time zone headache got corrected.It’s a great device but moody can’t done!!  Sometimes she responds, sometimes she responds before I have asked the question, sometimes she can do complex problems, sometimes she claims she can’t understand anything you’re saying and refuses to try. Sometimes she pretends to be sleeping when I’m talking to her…She a great help and a stress.If you don’t want to turn off life individually and like to control everything from bed, this is it. Also, if you never want to know peace…she’ll do that too."	3	July 9, 2022	1
57	Echo Dot	I’ll be returning it because every day for the month that I’ve had it, it loses the wifi for no reason.  I tried to get help but when I did the tech wanted $29.99 from me and then he said he’d help me out. I told him I didn’t have the money and all of a sudden, the phone went dead.  I tried fixing it with no luck. I really like it too.	3	August 7, 2022	1
58	Echo Dot	In my opinion I have tried a bunch of different voice assistants and they all need lots of work.  I have a lot of home animation but I still prefer motion sensors door sensors and even my phone or iPad over voice.  I actually forget that I can even use my voice most of the time do the fact that it doesn’t always 100% work. Where my motion and door sensors are 100% accurate.  For my hue lights I like  motion detectors also Philips Hue Smart Dimming Kit.Once you set up your home with motion detectors and door sensors. Like for example opening my closet door the light automatically comes on or when we walk into the bathroom the lights automatically come on because the motion sensor turns them on.  After having these automations with motion detectors and door sensors voice seems kind of an extra step that is not even needed.I do think the best thing that I have found to use the echo and Google hub  devices for is in the kitchen to set timers for when your hands are not able to touch a screen.  Also setting alarms are pretty easy and very reliable.  Probably the biggest thing that I use the echo for is to alert me when I get an Amazon package also it’s set to ring if someone is at the door ringing the doorbell.	3	January 9, 2022	1
59	Echo Dot	"Works to good, apparently while I was asleep I woke up for a few minutes but wasn't really coherent, idk what I said if anything to activate the Alexa controller device however, it recorded several minutes of me babbling on about dropping my medication box all over the floor. It was then sent out to my friends that had a Amazon device, there friends and family and god knows where else, apparently it had used my contacts to send that voice message to my friends, family and everyone in my contacts, it also somehow sent the voice message to my friends contacts and there contacts and so on n so on. I turned off my Amazon Dot that day after several of my friends called me to ask ""What's going on, at 7:00am or so I was woken up by a long babbling message from you, one friend said his sister got it to, idk his sister. Be careful ppl, I've since gone into my Amazon account/Devices/Recordings and found hundreds if not thousands of voice commands,  messages etc etc, I deleted them all and deregistered my several devices that I no longer own, I didnt know they stay connected until you remove them and all the data retrieved by them. Very dangerous device if not properly and thoroughly setup completely, read all of the instructions, follow them and, goto a non Amazon site for tips, ideas and what and what ""*NOT TO DO*"", Sincerely, an embarrassed, frustrated and unhappy Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation (What not to do) previous user."	1	February 11, 2020	0
60	Echo Dot	"After having had a Google Home Mini for about a year, but not being super impressed with it i figured i'd try the deal Amazon had to get an Echo Dot for $1 with a music subscription. Unfortunately i was entirely unimpressed with both.After setting up my dot, and linking it to the smart bulbs in my living room, i tried seeing what Alexa could do. Turns out, not much. Not only did it not understand the sample commands printed in the scant instruction book or Alexa app like ""Alexa, set lights to Green"", when it DID decide to actually do something, it would only control ONE bulb at a time.""OK"" I thought ""Lets see how it handles my new Music Unlimited sub."" Again, VERY poorly. There were a few albums worth of music already in the account, added automatically based on CDs i had ordered in the past (very nice feature BTW) so i asked Alexa to play some specific songs. Pretty much every single attempt was a complete dud. So next i tried getting Alexa to play my favorite podcast. Again, near complete failure. It took the dot multiple attempts to figure out i was asking for a podcast, and NOT a song with a similar title, despite me adding the word ""podcast"" in first at the beginning, then the end, and once, not at all. 4th time was the charm apparently, and i finally manged to get Alexa to play the podcast i wanted. Turns out though, that you can't request a specific episode, or episode title.Finally, i decided to try setting up a routine, something simple. I set up a hypothetical morning wake up routine, where Alexa would turn on my lights and ramp the brightness up to 100% over 5 minutes (something basic, front and center in the menu), and noticed that for some reason you couldn't set a color this way. Okay, white it is i guess. I also wanted Alexa to play a song as well. Well, turns out there's no option to ramp the volume on a song up, at least not in a normal way that i could see. So instead of setting up ONE routine that started about 5 minutes before i got up, and slowly increased in intensity, i had to make TWO routines. One for lights, and a second for the music 5 minutes later.I turned off my smart lights (not via switch, but via app, gotta have actual power to the things for them to work after all) and waited for the routine to kick in. At the appointed time when my living room lights were supposed to come on, imagine my surprise when only ONE light comes on. About 45 seconds later the second light finally comes on. BOTH lights are at around 75% brightness. Now, silly me i had assumed that the lights would start at basically off and go from there, gradually. Nope, almost fully bright, then every minute or so ONE bulb would suddenly click a few degrees brighter, followed by the other 30-40 seconds later.It's at this point i should mention that you cant set an entire room's worth of lights to do anything other than be on or off. So i couldn't just, say, have my entire Living Room group turn the lights on, then ramp up. No, that would be too useful. INSTEAD, you have to set each device INDIVIDUALLY. So i had to set the turn on at a set time, then ramp up in brightness over a period of time for one bulb, then do the same for the other.When it was time for the music to kick in, it decided ""Screw it, who cares if you set it to play from the Echo Dot. Let's play from the phone instead."" Literally every step of a very simple routine was an absolute failure.For being on the 3rd generation of Echo Dot the thing is pretty much like a beta-test product. The Alexa app is borderline useless, integrates poorly with the Echo Dot, and functions erratically when it DOES decide to try working."	2	May 17, 2020	0
61	Echo Dot	You have to almost shout for her to hear you most days but beyond that pretty great	3	September 14, 2022	1
62	Echo Dot	Easy to install. Alexa talks sporadically without warning. She is not as intelligent as Google.	3	September 20, 2022	1
63	Echo Dot	First, this is relatively new technology, and seems to have LOADS of bugs.  When Echo works, it can be quite convenient.  The set up process for each device is a bit of a pain as every manufacturer is a little different and wants you to use their app.  That wouldn't be so bad, but be aware, my experience is that I have to re-set up my devides every month.  Not the same ones mind you.  Sometimes it is the Gosund plugs, then the Sengled lights, or Cync, or another one I forget now.  In retrospect, buying all the exact same manufacturer plugs and lights would likely help, but in theory, all this is supposed to be easy, and it is...until I go through my monthly or more often re-setup.  And, don't forget that if your internet goes down, Echo shuts down also  One would think that would only disable the info features, but nope, Alexa does nothing if she can't talk to the internet.  All your convenience disappears.  The intercom aspect is handy, and overall, I like the features and use Alexa daily.  I also end up cursing Alexa almost daily when I am fighting with it to understand a phrase, repeating myself, doing re-setups, etc.  At some point, a lot of this will likely be worked out.  Just be aware we are not there yet and you should be tech-friendly, as I am, or I imagine this will be nightmarishly difficult.	3	December 7, 2021	1
64	Echo Dot	"This is really more a review of Alexa than of the Echo Dot. The Echo Dot is a decent speaker. For it's price, I'd even go so far as to call it a good speaker. But if you're like me, you're really buying the Dot so that it can host Alexa and turn your house into a ""smart house."" DON'T BOTHER.Alexa is dumb. Really dumb. And you can't even teach her to be smart, because basic if-then logic is completely beyond her. The programming is entirely set up for ""when"" commands. For example, you can program her to wake you up WHEN it is 6 AM.  But you can't program her to wake you up only IF you are at home. So if you go on vacation, your wake up routine will run, turn on all your lights, raise the thermostat in your house and so on and so forth EVEN THOUGH Alexa knows you're not at home. She knows your location, she'd just not smart enough to use it.Unless you've seen the skill you want to use EXPLICITLY displayed in a commercial, assume that she cannot do it.  Even if you have seen the exact skill you want, you should assume that it will not work as smoothly as shown. You can program a wake up routine, but you can't tell Alexa, ""Run my wake up routine at 6 AM tomorrow instead of 5:30 AM."" No, you have to go in and manually change the programming.  You can't program her to something every other Friday, only every Friday like clockwork or not at all.Here's a short list of things Alexa doesn't do:*Take action only IF something is true. NO if-then functionality at all.*Alter routines*Do tasks on a non-weekly schedule. NO every-other week, no once-a-month, no second-tuesday.*Play music for 30 minutes and then switch off.  Or do anything at all after playing music. Once the Echo Dot starts playing, Alexa is done.*Do a task at a repeated interval (i.e.: Announce the time every 10 minutes)*Play a shuffled playlist as part of a program or routine.*Ask you a question.  Seriously, she can't use any info you give her to take an action. It's dumb.*Regurgitate basic facts you've asked her to remember.*Lock the front door, even when it's a smart lock with an app and everything.Understand, we didn't just roll over and accept defeat.  I'm an engineer. Writing Excel programs is a significant part of my job description. I spend my days beating computers into submission and tricking them into all sorts of things they don't want to do. I was not about to accept that Amazon was dumb enough to put their brand name on a program and interface as monumentally stupid as Alexa was appearing to be. Surely, there was something I was missing. Surely, there was a way to make things work.I started by looking for skills, but didn't really see any that looked like what I wanted. So I went over to skill builder. Still no luck. So I escalated again, and went to the skill builder section intended for large companies. I thought, ""I'm an engineer. I program all day. I can handle it."" Except that apparently, ALEXA can't handle it. Even in the basic, backdoor coding of ""skills,"" available for high-dollar companies trying to build skills for Alexa to use, you can't use conditional statements. No if-then loops. No while loops. Alexa just doesn't function that way.I have depression. I have a roommate with executive dysfunction, one with ADHD and one with Autism. We all pitched in to get the Dot, as well as a bunch of other things to make the house a ""smart house."" Lights, thermostat, plugs, everything. No holds barred.  We were really hoping that Alexa would be able to help us with various basic tasks that we find difficult to manage for one reason or another. We were hoping that this new technology could help make us more functional. We spent all weekend installing the ""easy install"" light switches and thermostat.  We were so excited to get it all programmed and running. In the end, we were monumentally disappointed. The only reason we haven't returned everything is that pulling it all back out of the walls is quite literally more than any of us can handle.I can't believe Amazon has released this product/program and is actively associating their name with it. I can't believe that Alexa has been on the market as long as it has and is still this dumb. If-then statements are the most basic building blocks of programming. How, HOW do you release a program that's intended to be customized, and NOT include basic if-then logic capability?tl;dr - if you want a speaker that will announce the time on command, buy this echo dot. If you want it to make your life easier, give it a pass. At least until Alexa can understand something as simple as ""Alexa, if no one is home, turn off the lights."""	1	February 17, 2020	0

67	Echo Dot	I have ongoing issues with Echos: software is unreliable, e.g. movement detector works then stops working, drop in needs an IT degree to set up, streaming just stops for no apparent reason & the Echo becomes totally unresponsive.

70	Echo Dot	This is my first Alexa.  A OralB rep gave it to me when an OralB brush with Alexa, would not function as it was suppose to.  The Alexa with the toothbrush kept disconnecting. I’m having to learn a new way to speak, It’s not easy learning the apps I could connect with.  I simply want local news and tried to say the name as described by a local station, and It kept going to CNN or another news provider.  I’ve tried listening to apple music, but I’m not home much to enjoy it.  I tried games and meditation skills.  The trivia game was fun, I was able to challenge other owners.  The meditation music was odd.  Not at all calming. The sleep app did put me to sleep once. I’m not impressed with Alexa. I really thought it would be neat to have, but it’s a struggle to say the right words that activate what I’m asking for.	3	May 24, 2022	1

72	Echo Dot	I really only purchased this as a Bluetooth speaker and smart home integration, but if I get one more “by the way” unsolicited tip, I’m throwing this away and getting a Google assistant. One of the most annoying features that I can’t turn off!	3	August 11, 2022	1

74	Echo Dot	The System is great when you are able to have internet to outside service, when internet goes down  as in Eastern Arizona the items programed either keep running or never start, as a timer it will not tell you when time is up ( use Kindle fire as backup due to poor internet  . But other than that these echo dote listen and without a prompt join conversations. I love the system when it works and have 3 dots and a mini  work as intercom at times when I am i the stable or barn	3	July 8, 2022	1
75	Echo Dot	It is a  somewhat cool product, but there are clearly issues in operation.Smartlight.It found my Philips Hue Go lamp and could control it. At first. Then lost the connection and in spite of having it discover devices and finding it, it then failed to communicate. Many attempts of that and it finally worked again. And if can of course just select base colours, the moods the Hue has in the app won’t work. So functionality with the Hue smart lights is somewhat limited, the AI of the Echo isn’t good enough.SpotifyAttempt 1. Holy s**t, what a mess! I have a playlist on my Spotify. I use that because you can add whole albums to it, so it is the normal way to do it. Also I can pick different playlists for different purposes. Of course just the way a music service having playlists is supposed to work. But with the Echo it failed 100 %. When I asked it to play my playlist it either played some raining song (far from my kind of music too) or some Spotify radio station. If I asked it to play Suppers ready with Genesis it played “Genesis radio on Spotify”. If I asked it to play my liked songs it played, yes you guess correctly, something random that I do not like. After a while it started to play “daily mix one”. Hmmm…..Attempt 2. I unlinked and relinked the Spotify account and after that it works better. But not as it should. I can now actually get it to play the song I ask it to or the artist I ask for. That’s an improvement. But my playlist, nope won’t work. If I ask it “Alexa, play my playlist One” it tells me “Playing your liked songs”. And it does play my liked songs. Only thing, to get my music there I have to add every single song manually, which is quite a lot. And of course I can only have one library liked songs, I can’t use different playlists.So that’s where I stand now. It works, but only to play Liked songs. Using a playlist seems to be impossible for me, and that is in my opinion a severe functionality problem. I think for a Spotify user Google Home is a better alternative since google Assist seems to work better with Spotify.Maybe using Amazon Music works better and Amazon makes the functionality with Spotify inadequate on purpose. But for me Amazon Music is not an option. And if there is an alternative for Spotify on the device, you’d think it should be able to play playlists.All in all these things lower the grade quite a lot.	3	February 19, 2020	1

78	Echo Dot	Most of the time it works well but other times when you’d ask it to turn the lights on or off, it will say okay but the lights are still off or still on.

82	Echo Dot	I have to scream for my alexas responce i dont recommend it.	3	September 6, 2022	1
83	Echo Dot	I have an Echo Dot 1st Generation and a 2nd Generation Echo.  I decided to update both Echo's and add to my household for more quality and help from Alexa.  I had noticed that the speaker of 1st generation dot was starting to sound a bit off, like a cracked speaker, and Alexa wasn't responding as well as before (but she heard me better than this new one), hence the update of the dot.  And the upgrade for the original Echo 2nd Generation was because of the Zigbee hub (I updated to Echo Plus 2nd Gen).  That all being said...The Echo 3rd Generation Dot in the kitchen doesn't hear me very well (the old one did a better job).  Many times I will ask Alexa to add things to my shopping list and she gets it totally wrong or I hear the new Echo Plus 2nd Generation in the other room pick it up.  Also if I tell her to set a timer in the kitchen, again many times she doesn't hear me or the other one will pick it up.  I figure the reason the other Echo (in another room) hears me is because I am having to shout at Alexa to do what I am asking; set a 10 min timer, add eggs to the shopping list, ect.  Very annoying!Not to be all negative on the 3rd Generation, if I do play music on the Everywhere Group setting it isn't to bad sounding, but it is in my kitchen (my hub) and I need to be able to request to her to add things to the shopping list, set timers and she needs to be able to hear it correctly and not make me shout at her.Lastly, the Echo Dot 3rd Generation sound quality (when she does hear you) is way off.  I have tried repeatedly to bring up the sound quality (less base / muffled sound) for use in just the kitchen.  The Echo Dot 3rd Generation is way to muffled sounding, and sadly this one is going somewhere in the household where it will be rarely used and I will bring the old one back out of retirement...at least I could understand the Echo 1st Generation more, with no muffled sound, and she heard me way better than the Echo 3rd Generation.  I am disappointed in this Echo 3rd Gen Dot and glad it was on sale, per it wasn't worth the 50.00 original asking price.  I do enjoy the Echo Plus 2nd Generation with the Zigbee Hub, but it is in a different room, and I do play music through it.	3	December 8, 2019	1
84	Echo Dot	The echo dot seemed to respond slow and inaccurate at times....also sound quality not to good to listen to music.	3	August 29, 2022	1
85	Echo Dot	The sound quality on this and the other one I ordered is not great. It is very bassy, hard to hear, and if you turn it up, its too loud. The voice quality is fine, it is just the speaker that isnt great. But, we use it every day for weather and other info it provides.	3	July 27, 2022	1
86	Echo Dot	Lamentablemente el enchufe sólo se conecta con la aplicación de ALEXA, pero no reconoce otro asistente. Demasiado centralizado este dispositivo. Se supone que un dispositivo es inteligente por tener la capacidad de vincularse con otros y con otras aplicaciones?	3	August 5, 2022	1
87	Echo Dot	I was given a Gen 2 Dot by a friend who no longer had a use for it. I thought I'd give it a try and went shopping for devices to use it with. I even  bought a new Gen 3 Dot for my second floor. I installed the app on my tablet and got started. Initial set-up was fairly easy, almost intuitive. Voice recognition is very good. The smart devices were another matter. I spent almost an hour trying to get my first bulb working only to discover that it was bad. Switched bulbs and the second worked just fine. Sound quality is good but, oddly enough,  actually better on the older Dot! Over all these Dots seem a lot like the Fire tablet I bought several years ago. Well made, interesting, but little more than an enticement to rent, purchase, or stream content from Amazon. It can't do a thing with the 7000+ files in my audio collection.Home integration has so far been disappointing. 25% of the bulbs I bought are/were defective. They work fine as plain LED bulbs, so they'll get used, but they don't respond to the Dots. And the dimmer switch I bought for our chandelier won't work either. I'm not giving up just yet, home integration/automation is too appealing.	3	January 14, 2022	1
88	Echo Dot	"On many many occasions, more often than not, I have to yell loudly at her multiple times for her to ""wake up"". I have repeated the same command many times and she will not recognize sometimes. I was surprised by the quality of sound though! I play music through it and the speaker is rather good for it being so small! Overall rating? 6/10, I'd go for a newer model than the 2018 if that's even a thing. Only say that because hopefully they fixed/tweaked some things! May I also add, it's very creepy when i have to scream at her to hear me but she'll randomly go off in the middle of the night and I go in and listen to what she heard and it's something creepy, one night she heard and recorded ""mother"" when my room was absolutely silent. So maybe turn yours on mute over night 😂"	3	May 17, 2022	1
89	Echo Dot	The price was good but you only get what you pay for	3	August 30, 2022	1
90	Echo Dot	The device works as intended, but echos frequently try to provide data other than what I ask for. That's annoying and I have to tell it to stop all the time.	3	August 7, 2022	1
91	Echo Dot	It's good so far	3	September 6, 2022	1
92	Echo Dot	I like that you can request just about any song and it will play. I do not like that it listens to ALL conversations and starts identifying names with their voice, creepy!	3	August 10, 2022	1
93	Echo Dot	I just had to unplug the Amazon Echo Dot in my bedroom. I am a very light sleeper, and this device randomly lights up, blinks, and beeps. I have checked the app on my phone. I have tried asking Alexa to stop blinking. I may not plug it back in. I was using it for white noise, weather reports, and occasional music when I’m getting ready in the morning. It is much nicer at night keeping her unplugged.	3	July 5, 2022	1
94	Echo Dot	I own 5 of these. This is brand new. Constantly going offline, says my connection or password must have changed (they haven't) and I have to reset it over and over and over. Get ready Amazon, another worthless item is heading back.	3	July 30, 2022	1
95	Echo Dot	"Two complaints and one thing of note.- It worked wonderfully. All I did was plug it in. Then one day  got new internet (my portal died). Since then all it does is tell me to download the ap, and it will fix everything. I dl'ed it. Is there a setup button, yep. Connecting it? Not a clue. There is no Connection/Communication button. I have been through every menu of this ap and nothing helps.Complaints- I bought a 2nd Alexa, it works f'ing amazingly well in spite of being about as far as I dare use the wi-fi correctly. It has no connectivity issues, WTF.- Apple: An advertisement that plays every other commercial break where the people say ""Alexa"" that activates mine so it can tell me to DL the ap every 15-minutes...somewhere an advertisement executive needs to be shot.Oh, and one more thing...- I reached the point where I honestly could turn off my alarm to wakeup and still be asleep. No, seriously. I am conscious just enough to find the snooze button but not to become awake. So IO figured ""Hey, why not get an Alexa? I can set and cancel alarms much easier, it confirms them, and in my dream state I cannot speak 'alexa' and I need to be awake to recognize the source, so it will guarantee I wake up."" Problem:Alexa does not have a separate ""alarm volume"" setting. If you want a loud alarm, you need to set it to max volume for everything. I want to here my morning music playing at a 4 or 5 even if it takes a 9 to wake me up."	2	June 21, 2022	0

98	Echo Dot	Not much to say, I tell her to play, she dang sure better play. I like to talk to Alexa while I’m enjoying some home grown goodness. I tell her Alexa, play me some Cross Canadian ragweed. She says OK. And then it starts singing them boys from Oklahoma roll their cigs all wrong. They’re too dang skinny or way too long. Well I ain’t no holy roller so I just use a tong . Them boys from Oklahoma roll their cigs all wrong. Them boys down in Norman they got a kinky streak. Ain’t allowed to roll their own. Their Sooner wrist are too weak. They’ll sure start to puffin if you put one in their beak. Well them boys in Colorado they just as soon pan for gold. The nights are too long and growin season is too cold. They’d just as soon smoke a cig that Jason Boland had rolled. At least that’s what I’ve been told. Well them boys down there in Texas got some dang good cigs. That’s probably why they play such horrible football. Them dang Cowboys ain’t gonna win a super bowl in my lifetime. At least that’s what I’ve been told.	3	February 6, 2022	1

104	Echo Dot	"I have 12 alexa echo devices in my house.  Mostly dots, but I have a couple of shows as well.  For a long time all was well.  I kept adding to my network.  I have almost every light switch in my house moved to a smart switch.  I can open and close my curtains through alexa, and I have enjoyed using it as an intercom to the kids rooms using the drop in feature.  But recently, she has been getting stupid.Issue 1: Recently, I tried to drop in on my son, by saying, ""Alexa, drop in on [NAME]"".  This has always worked in the past.  Lately, at least half the time, she asks me, ""Do you mean [son's name/daughter's name]?  And I say no.  And she asks me who do I want to drop in on.  I tell her, and she is stuck asking me if i mean something else.  Now, the only think I can think of is that she has access to my phone's address book since my son has my daughter's old phone number.  What the heck?!?!  And Amazon doesn't seem to monitor their own help forums to even provide help.  So scratch that one off the nice feature list.Issue 2:  Forgets some skills, and seems to install others I don't want.  I am using a pretty obscure wifi enable controller to open and close some large curtains.  It worked for over a year.  Then one day, it just stopped working through alexa.  Still works through the manufacturer supplied app.  I looked in my skills, and the skill for that device is just gone.  All of my routines are still there, and refer to the skill in the settings, but the skill isn't there and when I redownload, I can't sync to the original account.  So scratch that off the nice features list.Issue 3:  The most basic smart home control:  Light switches.  I have two rooms that she has become stupid about.  The garage and the study.  I have always been able to say, ""Alexa, turn on/off the garage/study lights.""  And she has done it perfectly until now.  Now most of the time, she responds, ""The garage/study doesn't support that.""  What the heck?  So scratch that off the nice features list.If all you want to do is ask what the temperature is, then go ahead an buy an echo device.  Otherwise, I would say that this is giving amazon a huge black eye.  There are so many similar questions as mine on line, and even on the alexa page right here on amazon.  But amazon doesn't answer the question.  Seriously, this is self-proclaimed to be the most customer-centric company in the world, and you can't get simple trouble-shooting help!"	2	March 30, 2021	0

111	Echo Dot	When I ordered this it was supposed to come with a smart light bulb which did not come with it. The Echo itself works great, but the fact it didn’t come with the bulb as advertised was disappointing.	3	July 20, 2022	1
112	Echo Dot	Sound is muffled. I upgraded from my first generation echo for a better sound quality. This sound is louder but far more muffled	3	August 7, 2022	1
113	Echo Dot	The device is a cool gadget, a nice audio speaker with some smart features. For the most basic users it probably is more than necessary to enjoy audio with some smart functions on the side. Unfortunately if you are a power user, and say decided to have several of these and use 2 each as stereo speakers for your computers, you will realize the few but serious issues; Sound synchronization & annoying, totally unnecessary notifications of which device is connected and currently playing, are a huge deal breaker. The sad part is, that at least the notifications should be an easy fix, but lack a simple functioning switch to prevent that. The audio sync does work well if some app plays the audio, but used on a computer the audio will shift and lag behind (tested with various setups).	3	May 13, 2022	1
114	Echo Dot	This review is more about the poor customer service, which is just as important to any merchandise quality.  This dot is less than a year old and a couple months ago a section of the red ring light came on and won’t turn off.  I have tried unplugging it and resetting it several times but the red light won’t turn off.  Not only is it annoying, but it causes the echo to get warm since it is constantly on 24/7.  Since Amazon customer service is almost non existent, I’ve had to resort to google searches to try and find a solution, but there doesn’t seem to be any.	2	October 14, 2022	0
115	Echo Dot	It sounds like Alexa is speaking from the bottom of a barrel.  Too much bass and not enough high frequencies.  This can be resolved somewhat by using an amplified speaker, such as one of the OontZ models.  Turn the Dot volume down and use the OontZ speaker's amplifier at max.  Then bring up the Dot volume until the output is usable.	3	June 26, 2022	1
116	Echo Dot	when it works, it's great. I bought 2 smart plugs. The first worked great, then it just stopped, so I bought another new smart plug, from AMAZON that one doesn't work either. Now it stopped playing music. It said it is a router problem, but my router works with all my other electronics. I have tried turning both the alexa and the router off MANY times, no change. I am VERY disappointed. I guess I have to cancel my alexa. I'd really rather not, but it's no good the way it is.	3	June 6, 2022	1
117	Echo Dot	It’s great like the version with the clock on them better	3	August 14, 2022	1
118	Echo Dot	I was disappointed because I wanted a small Bluetooth speaker to use on the go. I work in a different location every day and it requires a Wi-Fi set up everywhere I go, which isn’t always possible. I might use it at home instead.	3	July 7, 2022	1
119	Echo Dot	I don't know if it's the device or Amazon itself. But ever since I purchase this device Alexa Jeopardy has been nothing but a frustrating disaster. I couldn't leave a review on the Jeopardy site so I have to leave it here. Jeopardy on Alexa hasn't worked correctly since I purchased this device. It shuts off in the middle of a game. It skips questions . I absolutely refuse to upgrade, so I guess I'm SOL. So either Amazon is either deliberately messing with the program so people purchase the upgrade or something is wrong with my device. That would be odd, because the same thing is happening on my old device and my friend's new device. So, is Amazon doing this deliberately so people have to purchase an upgrade? Or have they simply been having problems with this for over a month now that they just can't seem to figure out? You take your pick. My ten-year-old could code better. Amazon has reached the point where you have to purchase Amazon in order to purchase from Amazon. You have to purchase Prime in order to purchase shows on Prime. Pretty soon you will have to purchase Amazon in order to purchase Amazon in order to make a purchase through Amazon. How much more money does Jeff Bezos need? Will his lust for money not be satisfied until he's a trillionaire? Or is he bleeding us dry by nickel-and-diming us to death because he's a stingy, greedy man? Amazon, fix your damn products!	3	August 21, 2021	1
120	Echo Dot	If you just need something to take your aggression out on, this is it! I threw the first one out the door into a rainstorm and was happy after that.....Then, thinking maybe I was hasty or maybe improvements had been made to Alexa, I bought a second Dot. This one makes me crazier than the first. I cannot believe how much time I have wasted trying to pair it with lights, plugs, etc, and if you have set custom answers you have to remember to ask Alexa EXACTLY how you set it up. If you have an IPhone, Siri does the same job 150% better with no setup!Do not waste you time, money, or patience with Alexa!	2	October 2, 2022	0
121	Echo Dot	"So, I have a slew of 1st and 2nd gen Dots - more than I need, really. But I ended up having a scenario where it would be nice to be able to pair a FireTV with a Dot to pipe the sound through, and looked into the ""Home Theater"" function which pairs a 3rd Gen Dot with newer Fire Sticks and TVs. Short version: it doesn't work, so avoid if that's your intention.---About Home Theater---We have a Fire Stick that the app will see as available to use for Home Theater, but when I try to select this new 3rd Gen Dot it is greyed out and says it is incompatible. I also have another Stick on the same network that isn't that old, but it isn't even an option to try pairing anything to.  I'm so tired of Amazon's ""ecosystem"" of devices working so incredibly poorly with one another.Their Connect voice quality sucks, this feature sucks, the compatibility between generations for something as seemingly simple as playing an audio stream from FireTV on your Dot? Sucks. I'm not sure why they can't get it working on older devices, but that's annoying. What's more annoying is when you buy a product specifically for the task, which Amazon says should work, only to find it doesn't.---Sound Quality---These 3rd Gen dots still sound really quite poor - if you want to listen to music, you'll still have to output them to a dedicated speaker or suffer weak, muddy sound that lacks both clarity and depth. When you compare to something like a $15ish Logitech X50 bluetooth speaker, I have no idea how this thing can be AC powered and still sound so crappy in comparison. It's better than the earlier gens, but that isn't hard to do as the sound quality was quite possibly the worst sound I'd ever heard.---Conclusion---Ultimately, I'm done trying. I'll find another way. The features compared to Google Assistant based speakers are entirely lacking, and the sound quality still isn't good enough. Glad I got this Dot on the cheap because it allowed me to learn not to invest in Amazon devices like this anymore. Each generation ends up siloed from previous ones so you'd have to buy newer ones for simple additions, and even then they don't even work!Disappointing."	3	December 12, 2019	1

123	Echo Dot	This is perfect to use on my deck. It was easy to connect to my indoor Alexa. However, the one outside has poor sound quality. It doesn’t seem to affect  the one inside.	3	July 16, 2022	1
124	Echo Dot	It did everything it said it would and I was amazed with how well it answered questions BUT.. I bought 3 of these and all three only lasted about a year until it started having major problems. The speaker got very static-y, when I would set a timer with it, I couldn’t add any more time to it but it wouldn’t tell me that. It would just ring at the initial timer amount set, so needless to say, I had a lot of uncooked meals. And,  It wouldn’t understand a lot of my simple inquiries that I’d asked before with no problem. So if you don’t mind replacing it annually, then it’s a handy thing to have. The speaker on it is pretty weak though. It’s better if you can hook up an external speaker to it.My least favorite thing about this Echo Dot is that the ideal volume for me doesn’t exist..ex: level 4 is too soft and level 5 is way too loud. Oh, and there’s too much bass in the voice and not enough treble so it’s hard to understand unless you’re right close to it. The microphone does have pretty good range though. Sorry that I didn’t measure how far, but I can’t do it now bcz they don’t work as well as they used to.My favorite thing about it is that you can configure it in Settings to not shut down after it answers your question so you can keep talking to it. I like this bcz it’s habit for me to say thank you after somebody answers my question and when it turns off and I say thank you I’m talking to dead air so when it hangs around it actually says you’re welcome or other things that appreciate you.Wow, am I needy!	3	June 19, 2021	1
125	Echo Dot	The Good: It completes all of the basic tasks as intended.The integration is clever and user-friendly, but it isn't without flaws.With such a small unit, the audio quality is excellent.The voice recognition is also excellent. (To say the least, it's appreciation of my poorly pronounced Spanish sir-names (Music Artists) is amusing.)Small Footprint is small enough to fit almost anywhere without being obtrusive.The Bad: It lacks an internal memory function that allows it to remember and repeat information it has just delivered or performed - you can't ask it to repeat what it has just said. (This shocked me, and I believe it is a significant flaw that should be addressed in future releases.)It doesn't appear to have any logic circuitry, instead relying on a massive database of references and some basic cross-referencing to find and retrieve data with the Alexa integration. It does a decent job most of the time, but with smarter programming, it could be much better.A computer that isn't really intelligent. She's more of a junior librarian/assistant than an AI system of any magnitude. The sound quality could also use some improvement!Overview - a useful tool for mundane tasks such as timers, alarms, and reminders, as well as for fast fact checks (dates, history, latest news about a given person or subject). Notifies you when Amazon deliveries arrive at your door. For others, this could be the coolest thing ever for the house, as it can be used in conjunction with other smart devices to create a 'Smart Home.'But, in my opinion, this device isn't particularly intelligent - merely an adequate tool for performing routine tasks. It's used in this way, and the degree of complexity isn't quite as high as it should be. In my view, the technology is underwhelming.	3	April 26, 2021	1

127	Echo Dot	My family has two other ones in the house so calling Alexa would set them all off. I changed the name of it so it fixed the problem. Glad they added that option. However, it’s very sensitive so if I say anything that even sounds like it it will go off. And when I call it when I actually need it it will sometimes ignore me.It also won’t let me change my alarm tone aswell.Also you can’t name it you have to choose between the four names it gives you. I wish it would let us pick since my family is already planing to have one in each room (everyone likes to listien to music and so plan to have everyone have one for their each room) and there isn’t enough name selections and will cause them to have to have the same name :(	3	April 1, 2022	1
128	Echo Dot	"TL:DR - This is a perfectly fine bluetooth speaker and well worth what I paid for it (99 cents with an Unlimited Music subscription of 7.99 which you can immediately cancel if you wish) but don't expect voice command functionality to impress.To be frank, I didn't buy this device to listen to the weather, control the lights in my house, or operate a home security system.  My phone can tell me the weather, and light switches and manual locks have worked fine so far.  I got this because I like listening to music or videos while I cook, clean, and work on the computer at my table.  So basically I'm in it for a bluetooth speaker.  And I have to say, it's kind of neat to have a bluetooth speaker that accepts voice commands.  The problem is in how it responds to those voice commands.Me: ""Alexa, set the volume to fifty percent.""Alexa: ""Sorry, you can only set the volume between zero and ten.""Me: ""Alexa, what is fifty percent of ten?""Alexa: ""Fifty percent of ten is five.""This is the problem I've had with every voice assistant I've encountered so far.  You can't speak to them in everyday language using simple concepts that a computer should be able to understand.  Alexa should be smart enough to know that fifty percent is the same as five out of ten.  If you can't give the device simple, direct commands and have those commands be understood, then why have voice control?As far as a speaker goes, this is about what you would expect from a bluetooth speaker of this size.  You're not going to get clear and sparkling highs, but the overall sound is strong and there's the perfect amount of bass response if like me you enjoy music but also live in close quarters and aren't trying to disturb the neighbors.5 stars for Voice recognition - It knows what I'm saying.2 stars for Alexa integration - The device understands my words, but it doesn't know what they mean or act on them.4 stars for Sound quality - I hoped for a bit more clarity, but this is perfectly adequate for a speaker of this size and cost."	3	December 14, 2019	1
129	Echo Dot	I purchased Alexa because I’ve heard numerous things about how great it is from friends and family and how it supposed to make life easier. I wasn’t disappointed, but I also won’t say my expectations were met. My biggest problems with Alexa is how often she turns on or interrupts when she was never called upon. I can be watching a movie or a YouTube video and she turns on and says something. A lot of times I’m alone and in my bed and that’s very scary, but that’s not the worst of it. Around 1:00PM Alexa randomly seems to start reading me the daily news and I’m soo confused.... I don’t remember ever setting up something like that. Once again I get scared easily and this doesn’t help. I also cannot stand the default voice of Alexa. You’d think that with the amount of money Amazon has that they would allow for you to pick from a wide variety of voices. Alexa sounds too monotone and robotic for my liking. She’s also a bit high pitched which can be annoying. It’ll be a great improvement if we can get different voices for Alexa! Lastly, I’m also troubled by the amount of privacy concerns I have read and seen about Alexa. It’s always on the back of my mind, and it doesn’t help when I’m sleeping and I happen to wake up and see a yellow or blue ring around Alexa. I can’t help but think what it’s doing. I’ll have to go and check my history. I’m someone whose very interested in technology, I’m always looking to try out new tech, and while I’m glad I tried out Alexa, I can also just as easily live without it.	3	May 28, 2021	1

133	Echo Dot	I dont need to get up to turn on the TV or find the remote. They turn on and off the lights, they run schedules to turn on and off lights. They turn on plugs that operate fans.

134	Echo Dot	"This is a review for the device, and more importantly, Amazon Music and Alexa android apps.I received this as a promotion from Amazon where I got this for 99c with a subscription to Amazon Music at $9.99/mo.First off, the device itself seems pretty nice, the sound quality is good, but voice recognition is lousy. Even after training it.However, as this was to be used for Amazon Music and podcasts, it is beyond useless. Voice recognition doesn't recognize artists names or track titles. After several retries you are better off just going to the Amazon Music app.But, and here is where the issue is, the Amazon Music app and Alexa app are garbage. Absolutely terrible. Amazon Music somehow has screen refresh issues. It fails to load the screen, or goes into some dizzying refresh cycle where it loads over and over and over. That or it just displays a black screen.If you are lucky enough to actually find a track or artist you want to play, then hit the play buttonn, there is a rediculously long delay on the order of 5-10 seconds where it thinks about doing it.And then the buffering, oh the buffering. It appears they don't use one. It repeatedly skips and pauses, even on a a 280Mbs WIFI signal and 4G cell service. Its useless.And then, it will crash on you.And for the Alexa app, it crashes repeatedly. I have to click the ""close app"" button when Android indicates it has crashed in the background. This occurs roughly 4-5x per day.So, here I am with a device that seems capable, but the applications to use with it are garbage. What an ecosystem! Way to go Amazon. Hire some real developers please.I canceled my music subscription immediately. There's $10 wasted. Now I have a device that I was hoping to use for music and podcasts, and now I can't.Avoid if you plan on using this for music streaming."	2	January 19, 2022	0

137	Echo Dot	My main Issue with the Alexa dot is that it just stops playing at random, even if I choose a different radio station or streaming app it just stops playing.

139	Echo Dot	Pandemic play toy has become more than just a toy.  I like so much about it that it would be hard to send her packing.  Tried just one to start.  Then had to add 2 more.  Wanted to try the stereo feature and put one in another room. They worked very well for several months until I finally tried to set up the stereo feature.  It has been downhill ever since.  I have told Alexa that she better behave or start packing.I lost most of my programed responses that I added to the Skills or Blueprint.  Controlling my smart plugs failed.  Reset that up and now it is hit or miss.A big issue for me is the capability of asking to play an individual song is no longer available.  Then I have to listen to her long speech about paying for Music Unlimited to have that feature back.  I have never and will never pay a monthly fee to hear music.Now I also have to listen to commercials which never happened in the past.  I have a suspicion that eventually, once many users are hooked, everyone will have to pay to listen to music.I am now resorting to pulling her plug when one of the long sales pitches starts or a commercial comes on.  It takes more time for the re-connection,  but that is how annoyed I feel.Looks like I may have to reset the triplets of Alexa  and start over.I would rather have no stereo and all the functions working like before.	3	April 27, 2021	1
140	Echo Dot	Edit:Still 3 stars I won’t give more but definitely will less of it continues to be a frustrating paperweight. Also I never gave consent for Amazon to “pool” my Wifi for my neighbors Sidewalk is a big fat PERMISSION NOT GRANTED!!Original review:I bought this through an Amazon deal at Best Buy. I received 2 for the price of 1 and got 2 smart bulbs as well, during their “early Black Friday deals”. Let me start by saying I wanted this for 2 reasons and it disappointed on both. 1)To make calls for work to the carriers (most require to push “x” to get to the correct area and this won’t do that :( ) it works for the carriers I don’t have to select a choice or to call my account reps ect. Sound quality is spot on and it does a great job on listening in on meetings ect to take notes so I trade one for the other. 2) to use to listen to music and pod casts as I work or sleep. If Alexa would pick a better variety then this would be perfect. But example: I say Alexa play 80’s music and it chooses the exact same station that plays the exact same songs over and over. If I say “Country Love Songs” it plays the Country Love category on my IPhone gahhh. Alexa doesn’t seem to understand certain things and the routine and tasks I added don’t seem to work. Idk I will mess with this one a little more as I am new to all of this but it’s frustrating and may be returned. Best part: you can mute the echo and no accidentally calling or recording a call or conversation and I can “drop in” and make sure my home is safe when I am away.	3	November 12, 2020	1

143	Echo Dot	"Pros & ConsPros:- Voice recognition- Easy set up- Wireless Connection- Not bad sound quality- Able to turn off micCons- No internal battery (Did not say it had one)- Software has MANY issues (will go into in review)- Sound is not SUPER loud- Quality deteriorates at high volumeSo I have not had this long, having arrived mid day the just the day prior (had about 1.5 days now) but I have had many issues with it. I thought it would be better, being the third gen. I'll start with the issues with it, and then go on to what I like.I have been using it with Spotify, as well as a speaker for my computer. For Spotify, numerous times it has just not done what I told it. Its playing a playlist, I say ""Play %s from Spotify"", where %s is whatever, does not actually matter. It says Sure playing *whatever said* and then the music pauses for a brief second, and goes back to playing whatever it was playing before, with no change. The device heard me, recognized what I said, acknowledged it was requested to do it, and then did nothing. I would try numerous times in a row, and it would still not do as it was meant to (Again this is a software issue). Next, using it as a speaker. Numerous times it just stops playing sound. I change my speaker back to the built in sound on my laptop, and sound comes out, switch it back to the echo, and nothing. My laptop has no issue having sound come out, and the music is playing, the echo just refuses to output it. I have restarted the laptop, and messed around with the sound settings nothing changes it. I've changed what app the sound is coming out of, still nothing. The solution I've found, is unplugging the echo and plugging it back in, but I could have to do this even up to 3 times an hour. To me, that proves the issue is the echo, not the laptop. Of course, the issue is not always present.So onto the good. The devices voice recognition is honestly not bad, but I would say if you have an accent, lisp, or mumble, it will have lots of issues. Now that may improve with time, but that I cannot speak to. The set up is easy, all it requires is the mobile app, or I believe it can be accessed via a web page. Their is many features/apps one can install so it may interact (aka Spotify). It does not need to be connected to ones phone to work, which is nice. It has a button to turn off the mic, so it will no longer listen/record. I quite like that, but I cannot speak to whether it actually does stop listening and recording, I'd almost be willing to bet it doesn't, but idk.I got it with the special deal with amazon music unlimited, so I spent almost $10 all in all (one month music included). For that price it may be worth it, but I would absolutely not pay 40/50+ for this, especially with all the issues. As a whole not happy with the device so far. If anything changes, I will update this review to reflect.I will say, their customer service is absolutely wonderful. I got a call from them with regards to my issues mentioned above, before this review even went live."	2	June 18, 2020	0
144	Echo Dot	"We have all been dealing with the exact same issues for a while, without update.I was reserving judgement until they had a chance to update, but that is not going to happen.This is going to pick on the device as an integral part of Alexa.As a stand-alone blue-tooth speaker, It is fine, except for it's lack of battery.However, due to it's lack of battery, I would call that function ancillary.Ups:They are super-easy to get running.Some of the smart home features are really nice, and easy to develop for.Sound quality is excellent (for a tiny speaker).The (occasional) price point can't be beat.The build quality is excellent.Downs (Major):Multi-room audio constantly looses sync or drops devices. This would have been a deal-breaker had I known it going in.There is little to no management of individual devices.The trigger words are often misheard in general conversation, leading to general nonsense.Downs (Minor):Connectivity is an occasional issue, often requiring a manual reboot.(Amazon, if you are listening and tell me to check my network, I will tell you to sit in the corner.)Voice Recognition is functional, but you must know how to address it.The rules:  #1 - Background conversation must not be happening. This includes radio or TV. Volume does not matter.  #2 - Background noise must be as minimal as possible.  #3 - Speak the trigger word, then wait a second before the command. A 2-count is fine.  #4 - Enunciate with exaggeration! Monotone will not pass with Amazon. Use that stage voice!  #5 - Do not pause while speaking the command.Whisper mode is a lie.Amazon knows very little about pricing and information about Amazon services. Don't bother asking.""Internet searches"" are basically a mess. Good luck.Your location will be guessed. It will be wrong. It does this way too often. It ignores what you enter at setup."	3	April 27, 2020	1
145	Echo Dot	My son bought this for me for Christmas. At first it seemed to work fine. I have terrible ringing in my ears and a little hard of hearing so she is hard to understand sometimes. I wish there was a way to adjust the pitch of her voice.  I do like the sound of the speakers when playing music.  I have reminders set which have worked awesome until today all the sudden they were all had just disappeared. I had to re add them. No clue what happened as my routines were still there. The routines that play music I have a lot of problems with play on my AMAZON PLAYLIST. The routine will either not start or it will cut off short of what was scheduled. This happens for all the music I have set which is 4 of them at various times of day. The routines set that are non music seem to work great like my smart plug. Although I want my volume set to 5 during the day (after playing night music at 2) and when set in the routine she does not do it. I really have a love hate relationship with her at this point as I have to  manually start my songs majority of the time. When I verbally try to get her to play one of my playlists she gets it wrong most the time. I need my sleep music to be reliable due to severe insomnia issues and the music routines are just not reliable on my Alexa. Will go back to using my old boom box for my sleep music I guess.	3	March 3, 2021	1

151	Echo Dot	I just got my new Amazon Dot.  I'm having fun learning all she can do and it's still to soon to really review it but I have very early on discovered a very big, disappointing flaw I have to vent about.  I need to pick up my granddaughter at one time on Mon, Tues, Thurs & Fri and another time on Weds.  Unless I missed something, there is no way to set an alarm/reminder/notification/routine or whatever to do that on the Dot????  It's either every weekday or individually.  I guess once you got each one set up, it wouldn't be that big a deal but what about when her schedule changes, as it often does and you have to do it all over again.  I'll bet there are others out there who have different schedules thruout the week that will find it a pain also.  Or is my situation unique?  Having to set up an individual repeating alarm (or whatever) for Mon, then another one for the same time Tues, then another one for the same time Thurs, then another one for  the same time Fri and then still another different one for a different time on Weds is, ahem, less than ideal.  And you can't even exclude weekends!What were they thinking?  For something as 'smart' as this device is supposed to be, this is a really stupid omission.  Not everyone gets up at the same time everyday and we do have repeating schedules based on given days.  So right now, all my Dot does is turn off/on lights.  Which is cool, yes, but not as helpful as, say, a fully customizable alarm.	3	November 4, 2020	1

And it will do it every time with almost everything I tell it todo.

159	Echo Dot	"At the urging of my children, we joined the Alexa crowd with the Echo Dot 3rd Gen in the kitchen.  First, the good things.  Installed easily and unobtrusive on the counter.  Can speak to it in a regular voice and it seems to understand both my wife and me without problems.  Able to create lists for various shopping trips, if we can go, without problems.  Able to stream SiriusXM with stations selected on command, as well as Pandora and Spotify.But ....  the sound quality of the Alexa voice is muddy, and sometimes hard to understand.  I boosted the treble and lowered the bass in the equalizer, did not seem to make much difference.  Not clear that mine is defective, as many others seem to have the same problem.  Although it can interface with a Roku, the commands are quite limited; it can run a Roku application, but not control it once loaded, so you still need the remote.  Seeking information, Alexa is often beaten by Google.  For example, I wanted to know when the local NFL team was playing, it was able to give me the time of the game.  But when I asked for the network broadcasting the game, ""I don't have that information"" was the response.  Google Assistant came through with the correct information.  This has happened with other searches as well.  Disappointing.So, overall, Alexa is good, but not great.  Music played through the speaker is acceptable, but not the Alexa voice.  Commands can be limited.  We have one, not sure if I need another."	3	December 20, 2020	1
160	Echo Dot	I am (unfortunately) fully invested in Amazon devises.  I have at least one echo in every room of my house, and a fire stick on every tv.  A total of 12 echos/dots/shows plus an echo sub and 6 fire sticks.  When they work right, they are a wonder of technology.  For a fraction of the price of a Sonos, you can have whole home audio, plus integration with light switches and bulbs as well as home automation.  I use the echos for my shopping lists, reminders, alarms and timers, as well as checking sports scores and weather and even asking what time it is if I’m too lazy of roll over and look at my phone.  Firesticks also play nice with echos (for the most part) so in my garage, I have a nice sound system with two echos for atmos stereo sound and a subwoofer connected to my projector and I don’t need to have any wiring except the hdmi to the fire stick and the power cables running to the echos.  Soooo why 2 stars?  Well, despite all these neat things they can do, that is their job.  That’s why I have over $500 invested into this system.  Ya, that’s a good price for what I have but that’s if these things worked correctly all the time.  Thing is, they only work right about 50% of the time.  Using Alexa is terrible.  It’s the biggest flaw.  It just doesn’t hear things right and if it were human, I would say it is one of the most stubborn people I know.  I am constantly repeating commands multiple times.  Sometimes I will be right in front of one talking in a bedroom and you get a response from one two rooms over.  It is an issue with alarms because you don’t want a kitchen alarm going off in someone’s bedroom, etc.  the other issue is audio drop-outs.  I will just randomly lose audio in different rooms.  Even right next to the router while other things are streaming.  Then it gets stubborn and won’t comeback until you go into another room and tell it to start up again in the room you want.  If you don’t, it will keep telling you it’s playing what you requested but just goes silent.  Tech support is a joke.  Protocol for everything is (turn everything off, router, modem, firesticks, echos and restart.  Ok, I do that and most of the time it fixes it but when these things happen again and again and again.  Spending 30 minutes doing that is not a solution.  They just need to make a better product.  Anyways, I’ve seen plenty of people say “oh I have no problems”. Ok good for you, and if you only have one echo dot, ya, you probably won’t see as many issues.  I’m just saying, I’ve had 100’s and 100’s of tech devises and these (though they can do some neat things) are way too problematic to be satisfied with.  If I could do it over, I’d have gone with Google products for my smart home.	2	September 16, 2020	0

163	Echo Dot	Overall fun and useful. I've discovered a lot of new music with this. The sound quality is decent given the price and it's size. The one drawback is I'm bi-lingual, a lot of music I like is in Spanish and it has a hard time deciphering Spanish titles	3	June 11, 2022	1

165	Echo Dot	"I appreciate this product for my daughter, since she tends to ask a lot of questions of Alexa, but I don't like that I have to download extra items for something as simple as animal sounds. So if I ask Alexa what a chimp sounds like, I have to download an animal sounds ""app"" into the Alexa app to have it and then ask Alexa to use that animal app so I can ask what a chimp sounds like (an example of what I have to go through for my toddler daughter). Very foolish if you ask me. I don't like it. I just ask siri or Google and this usually collects dust."	3	April 10, 2022	1
166	Echo Dot	The idea is that you would “talk to it,” when in reality you give it limited commands, which in practice take more effort that we would really want. They are moving in the right direction but have a long way to go. The sounds quality does exceed what one would think for such a small item and the overall confection of the item is fairly good. It is heavier than it looks and Thai reflects overall good materials. The buttons could be a bit sturdier, to be inline with the overall quality. Given that it is at such a low price point, the use of it as a stand alone speaker that easily interfaces with other devices, and that it does have some benefit in terms of its “smart” capabilities and I think it’s pretty descent. If they charged more then it would go into the rip off category. Watch videos on YouTube and see how it is used. Then try to see how much benefit you get out of it, under those specific scenarios.	3	December 8, 2021	1

168	Echo Dot	I have an Echo Show 5 & 8 and they both sound much better than the 3rd. Gen Dot. I'm not sure why , but the 3rd Gen Dot will have a very distorted sound when Alexa is talking and most times when someone with a is talking. I returned the first one I received thinking it was defective, yet the replacement does the same thing. My other Echo devices don't have that distortion and I tested to see if it was my wi-fi connection by putting the Dot right next to my router. No difference. I'm not sure if the 4th Gen has an improved speaker, but I'm going with that model next time if I decide to buy an another Echo Dot and only if it's on sale.	3	March 8, 2022	1

Although I listen to music connecting it to a Bose Bluetooth, this sound is much better compared to previous generation.THE UGLY:1) ALEXA CAN’T HEAR YOU!!!  I have one in my kitchen’s island, and one top of the bed with 12 inches from my head (from below) while laying down.  While the device hears the “Alexa” call because she beeps and you see the light, she can’t recognize your commands.  If you say “Alexa what did you hear” she’ll tell you she didn’t hear anything in the last minute.  The one in the bedroom is 12 inches from my head and it’s the same thing. The devices will NOT respond to ANY whisper even though she heard “Alexa”.  I don’t know what they did to the microphones but I’m almost certain they downgraded them.2) THE VOLUME.  The 1st generation’s volume was quite pleasant.  You could even set it to 1% from the app.  My bedroom is quiet, so at night I like low volumes.  The 3rd generation can’t seem to be low.  I set the alarm multiple times and that seems to be an issue too.  This is frustrating late at night.Overall the only upgrade is for sound. Everything else is a downgrade from the 1st generation.  If you never had a previous generation, you’ll enjoy it.	3	October 26, 2020	1
174	Echo Dot	"I bought this for my livingroom and it worked fine for a couple hours... but then it loses its connection. I have an Echo Show in another room and it is working great. The Echo Dot IS connected to the internet but is having trouble talking through my router/firewall. After it has been plugged in for a couple of hours it trys to connect to ip address 192.0.0.2 which is an address used by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for IPv4 to IPv6 translation. This connection fails and the ECHO Dot stops working. The only response I get from the Echo Dot is ""Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding right now. Please try again a little later."" The Echo Show in the other room works fine all the time through the same router/firewall. Rebooting the router/firewall and Echo Dot sometimes fixes the problem but not always. Sometimes I have to wait several hours and then reboot to make it work again. FYI... my router/firewall is pfSense."	3	December 17, 2021	1
175	Echo Dot	Well, I am happy that I kept myself up with the newest product I found very useful and practical and these smart speakers are just one of them. Unlike many others, I am using the echo environment in parallel with the Google assistant. The main reason of doing so comes from the compatibility issues and what these devices are programmed to cover. Yes, there are many similarities that you can get from both but if you are really into the smart assistant devices then you realize that the differences are remarkable and I wanted to have everything covered and connected so I am using both (Amazon echo and Google assistant). For obvious reasons, way bigger than what I can even encounter in here, Google is dominating the market when it comes to the speed and ease of use smart assistants and Alexa which is still quite better than Siri, Cortana and Bixby are still way far from Google on the second place. A great example of the differences here is like,when you are talking to an adult person vs you are talking to a kid! So with an adult you can speak freely and expect to get a response most likely than you are talking to a kid. I personally can't blame Amazon for what Google has been dominating solely for years and years ahead of everyone else so if you learned how to speak with this kid (Alexa in here), she is going to get the job done accurately and there's more, as I mentioned on the very beginning. It comes from the area of what one particular device covers and it's that important to get your attention to have the more compatible smart assistant for the tasks or other services you are planning to use. The bottom line here is the third generation of echo dot devices are the best of it's own kind and having them in parallel with Google assistant will do almost everything for what is doable in 2019 technology relm.	3	October 23, 2019	1
176	Echo Dot	bought this for my bathroom and I have youtube music subscription, but this speaker does not allow you to connect it. So I returned it since its not good for my needs.	3	June 13, 2022	1
177	Echo Dot	Overall not bad for free. Voice recognition is so-so at times I find my self walking towards the device till it picks up the simplest commands. Volume is OK but turn it up too loud and the speakers crackle a lot. Even though it's last Gen. still integrates with my other Alexa enabled smart devices nicely.	3	June 1, 2022	1

179	Echo Dot	This review has been a LONG TIME COMING! Third generation echo is a piece of crap! It's cheap! It's unresponsive at times! It doesn't hear you very well or doesn't hear you at times at all! The second generation Echo was fast, always responsive, didn't take about half a second to a second to react (it was immediately), even the speaker power was stronger.I've had this piece of crap for 2 years and the 2nd generation for more than 5 years. They basically made a cheaper Alexa and implemented new cheaper features like less volume power when playing music and late response time as if there was a constant lag between you and the echo. I hate this piece of trash! The second generation is my favorite. I don't know how the 4th generation stacks up, but as I'm seeing more and more let's go cheaper, but sell it for more or the same price at Amazon. I'm not holding my breath for an even cheaper 3rd generation wanna be. Buy the second generation if you can or the speaker. DON'T BUY THIS THIRD GENERATION LET'S SAVE ON MONEY TO MAKE MORE MONEY AND SACRIFICE QUALITY FOR CORPORATE GREED, PIECE OF TRASH!!!Also, if you haven't noticed, why do you think they have this echo dot ALWAYS on sale or limited time price or they're giving it away with a 3 months subscription to whatever, keep the piece of trash and cancel the subscription anytime!? They are literally getting rid of it! WHY WOULD YOU WANT IT!?	1	August 31, 2022	0

181	Echo Dot	I would not recommend purchasing this if you’re looking to listen to music for an extended amount of time. I use this in my shop for music and it stops playing by itself. In an hour I would have to restart music. It will say, “Sorry Alexa stop working because there was no recent activity.” What activity would someone have to do to listen to music? In an 8 hour shift I had to restart the music 7 times. SMH	2	September 23, 2022	0
182	Echo Dot	I've always been wary of this device.  Amazon really wanted me to own a 3rd gen one for .99c.  Great deal for a device that will record every conversation in the area.  It has its uses, but keep the thing on mute as much as possible.  This, unfortunately, makes the Echo less useful.  Maybe you don't need one.	3	May 20, 2022	1

184	Echo Dot	Working from home, I figured that an external speaker would improve the Zoom meeting experience compared to tinny laptop speakers, so I ordered an extra Echo Dot for $20 on Prime Day. The experience has been mixed. The Dot paired with my laptop easily and the sound quality was definitely better than the laptop speakers; however, despite the fact that the Dot sits right next to the laptop, the Bluetooth connection is not stable, occasionally disconnecting and reconnecting for no discernible reason (and loudly announcing itself when it reconnects during a meeting).  I thought an easy fix would be to connect the Dot to the headphone jack of the laptop using a 3.5mm cable, but discovered to my dismay that the 3.5mm jack on the back of the Dot is an output only, not an aux input.  In other words, you can use the Dot to play music on external speakers, but you cannot play audio from an external source on the Dot.  To get a jack which handles both output AND input, you need to buy one of the more expensive Echo devices (e.g., the $100 Echo Gen 4 or the $200 Echo Studio).  No thanks.  For the huge price difference, I will make do with the annoyance of the occasion Bluetooth connection problems.	3	July 25, 2021	1
185	Echo Dot	I strangely feel cheated because my echo broke a month after buying it without the warranty. It's bogus and I'm not buying another. After talking to the rep, I was satisfied this was resolved and I'm less mad, but please buy the damn warranty. You'll need it!	3	May 26, 2022	1
186	Echo Dot	"""Alexa, do something.""""Sorry, I don't understand.""""Alexa, please do what I asked.""""Okay, doing something completely different.""""Alexa, stop!"" ""Alexa, please please do what I asked.""""Okay, doing something else completely different.""""Alexa, stop!"" ""Ok google, do this for me.""""Ok, done.""That's about the usual interaction with Alexa. Its voice recognition is BAD, and only correctly understands probably about two-thirds of the time. The other third of the time, it's really bad. If you're lucky, it will decide to define random words or play some random song instead of turning lights off or making a new reminder.  This is for native English speakers who lived in North America for life, probably speaking closest to their basic training data as possible; I can't imagine how it would understand a non-native English speaker or with non-American accents.Do I recommend it? Well, I half recommend it. When it works, it's quite useful, and has pretty good integration, but that's only when it works. You really have to jump through structural hoops and do it in exactly the right structure when asking for things (always always put ""am"" or ""pm"" on you time when setting alarms or reminders, since it likes to set these for the middle of the night), which can be very awkward and unnatural.The design of the companion app keeps changing and still doesn't seem to have a UX expert assigned to it, so it's horrible to navigate through (Google Home app is even worse though, so there's that). I use the reminders feature extensively to help the kids keep track of when to join online school meetings, but I have to go into the app several times a week to fix or create reminders that the voice interface can't do properly.Good: nice access to music and Amazon services (at least with Prime), good integration with wide variety of smart home servicesBad: bad voice recognition and intention understanding, clunky and rigid interface to access some features (you have to phrase it just-right), poor knowledge lookup results (i.e., web search)Comparison to Google Home: I've been using both for years. Echo/Alexa and Google Home are similar on the outside, but have very different (and opposite) strengths and weaknesses. Echo/Alexa are strong on music, Amazon services, and smart-home integration, while Google Home is strong on voice recognition and knowledge search (Google recently killed their good music offering) and ok on Google service integration. When they're on sale they're cheap enough to get both and use them for different things.Bottom line: Alexa raises your blood pressure when you interact with it because Alexa often doesn't understand, in comparison Google Home nearly always understands and does better search but has inferior integrations. Alexa with Google-quality voice recognition would be great, but it's nowhere near that."	2	October 27, 2020	0
187	Echo Dot	Great gift, have not made it work to its fullest capacity	3	July 5, 2022	1
188	Echo Dot	"Handy device, except when it's not, which is quite often.  Buy buying and using this not only am I subjected to ads (can't turn them off unless you cripple the device by making it ""kid friendly"", or putting it into a state my kids won't even use), but it also requires I shout at it sometimes (in a quiet room) just to get it to register the ""Ziggy"" alternative name they foist upon us.  All in all I would suggest waiting until you can buy devices that are more than convenient amazon shopping tools."	3	April 11, 2022	1
189	Echo Dot	This is a great device if you want to control things without having to use your full attention and such. I can control whether my smart lights are on or off, what color they are, and the brightness, all from a quick voice command. I can stream my Spotify music to it and control volume and skips through voice commands as well. Timers and alarms are loud and useful. The only problems I have with this device, is the lack of useful skills, shotty voice recognition, and an awful app. The app is laggy, unstable, and sometimes doesn't save things you change. There is no really good skills to download for it either, limiting it's capabilities. I wish they had options for different voices, especially different personalities. I am tired of my Echo sounding like she's dead inside. At the end of the day, extremely worth the price and a good buy, especially for a home with smart devices.	3	November 26, 2021	1
190	Echo Dot	"I bought this on black friday, because my 2nd gen dot was getting old and worn out.From what I can tell, they have expanded the frequency response to the detriment of clarity and quality. The bass is more noticable but not in a good way, the lower register of voice also sounds a lot more muffled.Oddly, this lack of clarity also seems to follow through to my bluetooth speaker, very noticable lack of sound quality when compared to the gen 2 dot on the same speaker. It sounds like one of those cheap boomboxes with the ""super bass"" turned on. And, no, there are no eq adjustments made, all are on-center.So, I've set this one aside for non-music purposes and reconnected my gen 2 dot for my music listening."	3	January 8, 2022	1
191	Echo Dot	Okay so I don't know if this is just mine, but this thing CANNOT hear me half the time no matter where I put it. Aside from that, when it does hear me, it often hears me incorrectly. I've done the things to teach it my way of speech etc etc. I find myself repeating things so many times and being misheard BADLY so much that I'm in a state of fury when I'm done. Lord knows what my neighbors must think always hearing the crazy lady arguing with her robot speaker. Yeah. So anyhow. That's a problem.	3	April 8, 2022	1
192	Echo Dot	"It sounds good, but here are the problems I'm facing it with it:Sound often brakes: Often times when the Echo connects to the computer, the sound crackles.  I have to unplug the device reconnect to fix the issue.Bluetooth Connection Notification: This very ANNOYING device constantly notifies you when it connects to a bluetooth device.  It could be connected to the computer for 10 minutes without use, but as soon as you play some sound, it has to loudly and blaringly notify you of its connection.  It's very annoying.Alexa:  Often times, Alexa responds to a statement/comment I made that did NOT involve Alexa.  I find myself having to argue with Alexa telling her, ""I didn't call you, Alexa - mind yo' business!""Not portable: This thing is not portable... why did I think it was portable?  Why did I think this thing had a built in battery? .... Uggh...Volume: You can sync the volume with your bluetooth device, but the echo notification will always sound at the volume it is independently set on, for example: if you have the volume on low from your computer, and you're listening to it low from the Echo (because it's synced), and you receive a notification sound, that sound is going to be heard at the volume the Echo is independently set on (which is usually on high).Alexa...raise the volume: And she raises the volume slightly... slightly...."	3	February 12, 2021	1
193	Echo Dot	We have 11 Alexa units in our hous of various kinds. The whole house audio with multi room setup works for about 2 songs and turns off. Many of the devices don't stay connected.I will be going back to a mostly wired setup. These Alexa devices are not reliable enough. Every time I'm excited and trying to show someone, it fails.When 2 are in a stereo pair, it sounds significantly better than 1 and doesn't have many issues.It's the multi room audio that is bad.The Alexa app is always freezing and glitching too! Probably the worst part of this device is the app you need to control it. I haven't used Google home, but am thinking it might work better.We have all the Alexa devices. They all have the same connection loss and multi room audio issues.Very very dissatisfied with the app.You can't play music you like. Your almost forced to pay for Amazon music.There are so many work arounds to getting different things to play, but none are flawless.If I could start over, I would not go with Alexa devices because of the connection issues, and especially the app!	2	April 3, 2022	0
194	Echo Dot	"I purchased this 3rd Gen Echo device to replace an echo ""flex"" dot that wouldn't maintain a consistent blue tooth connection to an awesome HK Onyx speaker I use. At first tried to use the headphone jack (on the 3rd Gen Dot) to connect the speaker (but it didn't work). It does however maintain the BT connection much better. However, when connected via blue-tooth it does not work well in an ""everywhere"" speaker group. I have 5 echo devices, and I link them for whole house music. I informed AMAZON, and they have passed it on to their tech group, but no joy yet. So I use this 3rd Gen dot as a stand alone dot in my kitchen, and when not BT connected it does work in my ""everywhere"" group. In the meantime the 2nd gen dot is Bluetooth connected to the Onyx speaker, and does work with ALL of the speaker/dots in my ""everywhere"" group.  So I got the result I wanted (eventually) but performance wise the 2nd generation dot works better than the 3rd gen dot. Sound quality wise, the 3rd gen dot is a much better speaker than the 2nd gen dot (when used as a stand alone unit)."	3	August 13, 2021	1
195	Echo Dot	"I ordered two echo dot 3's when Amazon had their ""big sale"".  One set up to wi-if no problem and has worked great since. The second one, I had to try several times to connect, before I was successful. But it did not stay connected and all I could get out of it was a "" I'm having difficulties at this time, please try later"" response. At times it would just start talking without even being prompted.Then it might work for a week or so before it wouldn't do anything. I reached out to customer service via chat. That chat lasted over thirty  minutes only to be "" disconnected "" before problem resolved.  Again I reconnected going thru all the steps.  Week later it didn't stay connected, so I called and talked to a "" electronic specialist "".  That call was over half an hour long. I tried requesting a return shipping label, so I could send it back and get a new replacement since it was a faulty device. I was told that is not an option. I would have to send it back and they would fix it.  I responded that I bought a new item and want a new one as a replacement, not a ""FIXED ITEM ""  He finally agreed to send out a NEW echo dot and I would have to return the original.  A few days later, I received a ""REFURBISHED"" echo dot 3.  When I called to speak to a  supervisor, I was told that it is their policy to send refurbished ones if a new one is not in ""their stock"".  Doesn't matter they have new ones to sell on the website. I told him that I don't except that and it was not what I paid for. And if they are sending out refurbished echos, there must be a huge problem with them. He advised that they test them and to try it out.  So I opened the box.  All that was in the box was the echo dot. No power source .  Again 4th time reaching out to a Tech specialist- supervisor and 45 minutes of phone time. I was told that they only send device out when replacing. And they don't send out any accessories. When was a plug considered an accessory when it is needed to use device.  Again I told him that I bought a new device and it was faulty and I wanted a new device as a replacement.  Not one that has been fixed.  Also I found out that the 90 day warranty did not begin again when the replacement device gets registered. They back date it to the original sell date of first device.  So I only had 40 days left on the warranty.  Also if you go on line , a refurbished echo goes for $29.99, compared to the $ 49.00 , for a new one. Not once did any representative say that I would be refunded the $20.00 difference for the refurbished echo dot. I told him that this is an AMAZON echo dot. It has their name on the product and they should stand behind their name. I also said if I were to buy a tv from a store and took it home and it quit working, they would replace it with a new tv, not a refurbished one. I will never buy another electronic device that AMAZON sells with their name on it. I will tell all my friends and family that they will get screwed if something goes wrong with their product. So buyer beware.  Amazon does not stand behind their products and the consumer whom keeps their  business Alive."	1	September 10, 2019	0

197	Echo Dot	I received mine today as part of the promo $.99 Echo Dot with Amazon music subscription. I thought great, here’s an affordable easily portable little speaker. I intended to use this as a Bluetooth speaker on camping trips and nothing else. First off, you can’t even pair your phone to the speaker without having the Alexa app. Second problem: you cannot pair your phone to the speaker if you do not have Wi-Fi. I do not have WiFi where I live. Third problem: the minute you unplug it from the power source it turns off - there is no power on and off button.I have no desire to use it for Alexa. I don’t use any of the assistant apps like Alexa - why? Well. Amazon records you. Don’t believe me? Look it up. I’ve heard horror stories of Alexa recording private conversations and then somehow sending them out into the public. You can go online to view all of the recordings your device has on you. You can individually delete recordings as you choose but you cannot stop Amazon from recording you. It’s supposed to only record you when you use the word Alexa but somehow sometimes it records more even when you don’t want to.So. I will be sending mine back. It’s my fault for not reading more about the functions of this device and assuming I could trick it somehow to be used the way I want. I’m giving 3 stars just because I can’t say wether it works the way it’s intended to or not so I don’t want to leave just 1 Star but I also can’t give it 5.	3	June 15, 2020	1

201	Echo Dot	I used to love alexa, but now, they've turned her into that nagging child , tugging on your pant leg perpetually asking, 'are we there yet?'alexa wsa great when all she did, was what you asked her tonow she wants to tell you moooooooorrreee , and annoy the (#&( out of you in the processif you have one of the show varieties, you have a screen in settings that allow you to turn on and off whta kind of content will be displayed on your screen.  Thtas a nice feature, until, you find out thta they turn it ALL back on, when they do a push update.So instead of remembering your settings, like you would expect with a SMART device, it resets all those settings to on.  Which means , after each push update, you have to go around to all your show devices, and start scrolling and turning off all the options it turned back on.seriously?next comes, the by the way feature, which you cannot turn off.  again, seriously????you ask her something , or simply tell her to play music, and now and then you are rewarded with alexa rambling off at the mouth like an annoying child,  oh btw blah blahblahlbhaablabhjust shut the #**** ** already and do what I said.and you cant stop her from doing it.the voice recognition is generally pretty good, but after , what almost a decade, it still struggles with certain words and you sit there acting like a tourist in a foreign country slow speaking words trying to get it to understandalso, if its not connected to the internet, forget EVERYTHING.I have it tied to my philips hue light system.  Now considering these are smart devices,  connected to a home network, they should still be able to talk to each other on that network. but nope, it cant.  when my internet goes down, which it does from time to time,  everything stops.  I want to turn off the lights , forget it, alexa is having trouble communicating.  Well its connected to my home network still!!! i should be able to talk to the hue bridge and turn the lights off. but nope, it cant,  so rather than sleeping with a house full of lights on, I have to get up and go turn them all off.  This should not be a problem with a smart device in 2021.I used to love alexa, now, I hate it.  more directly I hate those in charge of seeing to it that alexa is not something that enriches our daily life, but annoys us to no end.	1	February 6, 2021	0

206	Echo Dot	So, I got the two echo dot speakers after a friend gave me their larger echo speaker.  The setup was very easy and Alexa seamlessly integrated with my network, she seems to work well, and I was able to even integrate my Sonos speakers with the network, which is nice.  I now have music in every room in the house.  The problems are:1) There is no full functionality of third-party music services with Alexa.  Have Apple Music and Spotify and Pandora accounts...Apple Music is a paid service, too...but despite having Apple Music set as the default music service in Alexa, she continues to default to Amazon music.  She also refuses to shuffle playlists from any of the music services that allow you to build your own playlists (Spotify and Apple).  You set her to shuffle mode and it just continues to play the playlist in order...and she won’t load the whole playlist...she only plays about the first 15 songs on a loop.  So, while she works okay, there is still a lot missing with full functionality of third party music services.2) Playing music from the Echo speakers requires separate commands for each room, or she’ll just play on all speakers.3) She won’t play the same music on both the Echo speakers and the Sonos speakers...while they are linked in that Alexa will control the Sonos speakers, she will not play the same music on all the speakers.  She requires separate commands for both Sonos and Echo speakers.So, while we are enjoying the benefits of having the speakers, and there are many, I really wish the developers would get to the bottom of these third party music service integration issues.	3	January 10, 2020	1
207	Echo Dot	The Echo Dot 3 is an attractive, compact device. It's a decent speaker with good, clear sound. Where it falls short is where you need it most. 1) Alexa's voice is WAY TOO LOUD! More often than not I find myself just unplugging at night to avoid the temptation to speak the wake word and have her blurt out at high volume like some drunk girl at a party that's already wound down. As it is dependent on wifi, any command while not connected will prompt a super loud reply, like say volume down while using the bluetooth function to stream shows or music. Same for when it connects to a device. She just yells out the device serial number. I've tried to find ways to quiet her voice level vs music and I just don't see the option anywhere. 2) For it to be a smart speaker that is compatible with smart devices it sure doesn't seem all that smart. It still needs to be manually connected to other devices that A) that are in the same network, B) have Alexa C) Have Alexa under the same account... D) Are streaming Amazon content. Feels like 2008 all over again. The Alexa app is ok but nowhere near as intuitive as it should be. 3) Echo Dot 3 is NOT a portable, speaker as it has no battery. Maybe they're saving that feature for the 4. I've never had a desktop speaker that I couldn't take with me. There are however 3rd party devices available to remedy this. Overall, like I said, decent sound device. As long as you have stable wifi and the patience to constantly adjust the volume and to the situation you should be fine with it.	3	December 31, 2019	1
208	Echo Dot	"Overall, I like this product. I have many Echos and have bought many more as gifts. I'm not going to talk about all her qualities because everyone else has that covered.Here's my problem. I use this one mainly as an alarm clock and sleep noise machine. Alexa used to work flawlessly for this, but she has become increasingly annoying with attempts to upgrade my services. The sound randomly shuts off in the middle of the night. So first problem is that I have to speak out loud, waking my husband, to get her going again. THEN to make matters so much worse, she launches into a sales pitch. Saying ""stop"" doesn't work. She just keep pitching that upgrade. Sometimes she promises to only make that offer to you one more time, but she lies like a cheap rug. So, in the middle of the night, there I am arguing with Alexa. by the time she starts making ocean sounds again, I'm angry and can't get back to sleep. I guess I'll have to buy an actual sound machine and have two things on my nightstand instead of one. UGH!"	3	August 10, 2021	1
209	Echo Dot	"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I use my Echo Dot 3rd Gen for reminders and forecasts, and occasionally a song, but I otherwise don't expect much from it.In November 2021 an update was pushed into this device, and suddenly it started losing its connection to my WiFi and de-registering itself from my Alexa App. I've tried working with Amazon CS twice, and both times went through the factory reset process, but the device immediately stops working again.The issue seems to be that it just won't hold a connection and is stuck trying to update. If I factory reset the device it works, but then I will ask it something like ""remind me in 30 minutes to eat"" and it will say ""reminders are currently not supported on this device"". If I ask it again it will repeat this, but then after a few tries it will say ""okay, I'll remind you in 30 minutes"". The last reply used to be the only reply it gave when it was still working, but these forced updates broke my Echo Dot and now it doesn't work.The other problem is that if I unplug it or the power goes out, and then power is restored instead of just reconnecting to my network like it used to it gives me this rotating orange light and won't respond at all. If I push the action button it says “Updating your device. I’ll let you know when it’s ready.”Factory resetting is the only way to fix this, but then the same problems I described start happening again; “reminders not supported”, and then “updating your device”.This started around the time the update was pushed to this device. The fact that it’s not working is a consequence of something from Amazon’s end and not my end. If this cannot be fixed I would like the device exchanged for a working Echo Dot.Amazon literally broke this device's functionality. Until this recent issue My Echo worked well enough for the small number of tasks I used it for. I will try reaching out to them again to see if they are willing to replace what they broke through their OTA updating policy (which their CS told me they cannot roll back despite the problems it has caused). I hope they will be willing to do this, and be more careful about what they are doing with these device updates in the future.When it works it's nifty, but Amazon can make it stop working, and that is a serious design flaw."	1	November 18, 2021	0
210	Echo Dot	I find google nest has better integration with Youtube Music. Also Google Assistant outshines Alexa with more functions, better comprehension, and better search results. Voice pickup is not great. Either get more recent generations or go with Google.	2	October 13, 2022	0
211	Echo Dot	"Music sound is acceptable. Female voice is very muffled.  Male voice much better but not great.Purchased this as a second unit to use at the back end of the house so that the wife and I would be able to hear reminders and timers in either end of the house without worries. It would seem Alexa would be able to ""talk"" to all of the echo devices at the same time. I can understand not being able to stream music to more than one device without paying for it but the Echo devices should be able to do the simple tasks and announce on all the Echos at the same time.Sound quality and lack of simultaneous announces is why I give it only 3 stars."	3	January 1, 2022	1
212	Echo Dot	It doesn't work with the smart socket I bought with it.	3	June 21, 2022	1
213	Echo Dot	"From a quality perspective, you cannot beat the sound and the manufacturing quality.  From a technology perspective, I think the technology is cool, but I remain concerned on privacy issues.  What is ""Alexa"" listening to in lurk mode?  How do I know what ""Alexa"" is recording or not recording?  I remain frustrated that around the 90 minute mark when listening to Pandora thru the Dot, the music shuts off arbitrarily.  I am not a big fan of only having two different voices for ""Alexa.""For these reasons and more, I don't know!"	3	March 9, 2022	1
214	Echo Dot	This is my second Echo. I have an earlier generation of the  Echo Dots, so this is a comparison to that one. The sound of music is much better. However, the microphone seems worse. It will hear its call sign,  but then it only waits about 0.0005 seconds for a command before it stops listening.  It's like the chime  that it heard me is also the buzzer that my time to speak is done.  I frequently have to give one word commands to activate and command it (Alexaweather, Alexaturnoffalarm) even with the adaptive listening function turned on.  It drags the total review down because I'm changing the way I interact with a device that is typically very intuitive.	3	January 9, 2022	1
215	Echo Dot	I've used my Google Home speaker for a couple of years and decided to get an Amazon Dot for another room. It was easier to set-up than than the Google one, but the sound quality was not as clear. For the most part, it is very responsive and gives good information. However, it provides the wrong location for weather when I ask for my schedule. I've gone through every setting possible to fix it, reset, reconnected, uninstalled, reinstalled, but it remains wrong. I've scoured the internet and found this to be a common problem with others, even trying every hint for correction that a few others used. This is very disappointing and makes it about 60% useful to me as compared to its rival product.	3	January 6, 2022	1
216	Echo Dot	"OCTOBER 2021 Update: I've unplugged her a few times, this time maybe indefinitely. Always confused, constant wrong answers, hardly understanding what exactly your question is... Or your commands... Quite frankly, I'm very annoyed with Alexa and unplugged her and about to trash her. Google on my phone is far far more successful... So annoyed lately.So, I wish I could give this a higher review. Here's the problem & after research on the internet many many more people also have this same issue. The volume. Every day the volume lowers itself to an almost inaudible level. You constantly have to tell Alexa to ""turn the volume up"" Sometimes more than once a day, because yes it will Sometimes lower itself whenever it chooses. Also, when you ask her to turn her volume up, like tonight, it turned my TV volume up... 3 times I asked until I got annoyed & had to manually do it on the App... Almost made me want to give it a 1 star. I was trying to Google, since Google seems to most always know what your asking & give the right answer as opposed to Alexa, but anyways I tried to Google a solution. As far as I've found, there is no solution, nothing in the settings to fix the volume issue so your stuck with that annoying issue every single day. Not to mentions Alexa doesn't always get your commands correct, will often confuse questions with commands & vice versa, & often has a difficult time giving you the right answer or Sometimes an off the wall answer to a question you didn't even ask. It's like having another girlfriend, but one that at least doesn't argue back...lol 😆 Just annoys you...lol. jk jk... Anyways, half the time it sucks & the other half the time I lovs it. I enjoy the sound quality, the option to control devices when it works correctly, & it's many other functions that work a little more than 50% of the time... Amazon... Please make it a little better. The sound control issue, that shouldn't even be an issue in the first place... Thank you. Hope some of you found this useful. Alexa is still, for the most part, worth the buy... But half wondering how Echo Dot is...."	2	March 3, 2021	0
217	Echo Dot	It took several boot ups before it when into the initial startup. I ended up having to call tech support but it still picks strange things to want to talk to	2	October 22, 2022	0
218	Echo Dot	I don’t when I’m watching tv and a commercial coming talking about Alexa that it can pick up when the tv says Alexa. I would like the volume to be louder. And you should be able to play it with out the charger	3	May 16, 2022	1
219	Echo Dot	Got this to replace a 1st Gen dot and while the standalone sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity are significantly better, it is frustrating. My family often gets impatient with this unit because it frequently has multi-second delay after you say the wake word–and about a third of the time, it takes 3+ tries to get it to wake.Another minor annoyance: it has its own special power cord. The previous version used USB and you could plug it into a hub or multi-port 120V charger. Now you have to use a dedicated 120V plug–maybe it's Amazon's way of selling more power strips??	3	February 10, 2022	1
220	Echo Dot	The sound on this thing is horrible! Huge disappointment but I do like being able to control my devices. I love clear rich sound so this is just a no for me.	3	May 22, 2022	1

222	Echo Dot	"I bought a couple for myself when they are on sale for Black Friday. They are kind of cool little tools and I'm honestly not worried that they are ""spying"" on me. I mainly bought them to conveniently play music but I have had some issues with the voice recognition. Regardless of the music service I am using I have this problem, and it seems to be an Alexa voice recognition issue. I believe I speak pretty clearly, and in standard American English, but I can say something like ""Alexa, play the album 'Ruiner' by Alex Noble"" and it will NEVER understand me, no matter how hard I try. It always wants to play something with the word ""Rumor"" in the songname by a random arist, rather than looking through the catalog of the artist I mentioned and finding the closet song, which might be a good way to approach this problem in my opinion. Anyway, this was just an example and it has happened when I have tried to play many different songs and albums.Another issue is the Spotify integration. I was having issues with it and eventually completely de-synced Spotify from all my Alexa devices. According the the app, Spotify is not associated with any of my devices, but for some reason it will still play some content from Spotify. I don't get it at all and if it is user error, it is due to something that was poorly designed, because I'm reasonably smart and can't figure out the error.I'm glad I got the things, and hope this will be improved in time, since all it's knowledge and programming is ""in the cloud."""	3	January 14, 2020	1
223	Echo Dot	This device was very useful and entertaining. We connected our smart lights, and home thermostat to it so it was convenience to be able to turn on our lights hand free. Voice recognition is not always on point. HOWEVER, we have it for a year now and it seems like Alexa is getting worst. We have to repeat ourselves several times for her to recognize a command. Only a year old!!! Not sure if Bezo had anything to do with her sudden and quick decline. I wouldn't be surprised if he had his team programmed their products to stop functioning after a certain amount of time.	3	January 31, 2022	1
224	Echo Dot	"Had a horrible time trying to connect with my wifi. Was told by an Amazon specialist I had 32 devices connected to my wifi & insisted I purchase a firewall for 99.00. My internet provider assured me this was not true, did NOT purchase a firewall, I continued to keep trying, and finally succeeded to connect after many attempt for several days. This experience opened my eyes about trusting ""specialists"" in the future."	3	April 6, 2022	1

227	Echo Dot	So I got this with a tv I purchased and was super excited because I’ve been wanting an echo and needed one for the smart bulb and plug I had purchased via Amazon. Setup is very simple once app is downloaded. The issue for me is keeping the device connected. It took about a day for the device to stay connected and even then I’ve had for a week at this point it is still disconnecting. Other than that I love it. It’s loud, it connected to my smart bulb fine (but that disconnects too once Echo disconnects). I’m hoping it gets better. I chose this over Google (which my son has and never had issues with).	3	December 30, 2021	1
228	Echo Dot	For the most part Alexa is a superior external speaker for my tablets. It does play the music I enjoy.  Its good for updates on weather and national news. Alexa doesnt do well with requests for local news  I have to ask  multiple times to get it to read an audio book and its slow to learn my speach patterns and the time allowed to ask questions  is too short.as this was a gift I am inclined to overlook much of the inconvenience . I am  however getting frustrated with many of the claims for what it can do and it doesn't.	3	January 20, 2022	1
229	Echo Dot	"After 1.5 years of use, the best way to describe my experience with echo products is ""annoying"".I own 8 echo dots, a Fire TV, an echo plus, 2 echo studios, and an echo sub that I have placed throughout the house, to use as distributed speakers for playing music. Alexa controls allow for speaker pairs, home theater, room groups and multi-room groups, so everything would be great, right?!Well, except for the fact that the devices lose proper connection to the network for these complex setups - if you want to get it working again, you just have to go through the reset process. Except I bought in, and trying to reset all these devices every week or every few days is an abominable, endless chore.So I tell my speakers to play a podcast from the bedroom group, and the device acknowledges, and nothing happens. So I ask to play from the home theater group, acknowledgment, and nothing.I've tried upgrading the router, bought a second router to act as a repeater, and it's just not getting results. Believe me when I tell you that I've spent nearly as much time talking to Amazon support as I have my own family this past year.I would note that Amazon support has been very helpful through the app, but the app itself is abysmal, slow, and riddled with bugs that constantly tell me new echo devices have been discovered on my network.If this stuff worked, it would be amazing. But it doesn't. 1/3rd of the time, things are fine. 1/3 of the time, I'm listening to music and small weird glitches cause sound artifacts and small delays that make the songs choppy. The other 1/3rd, the devices just don't play music when or where I tell them to.At this point I can't even feel okay with selling these off to some sucker. I just want them to play music when and where they're asked, and play audio from my TV. Will they ever work? Only time will tell."	2	May 1, 2021	0
230	Echo Dot	"Setup was a breeze.  Got it online, started to link some of my home automation accounts...etc.  A couple of issues I have had was the ""EVERYWHERE Speaker.""  According to details, you can link all or specific echos in x-room so they all play music. So in essence, you can walk through your home and everyroom that has an echo, will be playing the music you had launched from room 1.  After looking through documents etc, I still can't figure it out.  Previous posts have said this is a bug in the software.  My echo gen1 worked fine.Second thing I've noticed, I have FireTVs linked.  I can't control them via voice. Prime example is - Alexa, turn off Diningroom TV.  Response:  Did you mean Livingroom TV?  Again -- not sure what the issue is:  I can control the same tv via wifi, with my phone.Little things like this have been irratating.  Apparently my google-foo is failing as well.  I'm not able to find info on the topic, but it would be great if this was a bug, if it was actually fixed.  OR if there is a FAQ or knowledge article on it, it would be awesome if the online help would help."	2	January 11, 2022	0

233	Echo Dot	I was given/bought this as a gift and even though I set it up with my Amazon account it is still paired with the account that ordered it as a gift for me so I get notifications from both accounts.Also when I paired the device with my Amazon five TV it only used the echo dot speaker and not the TV or auxiliary speakers which drastically reduced the sound so I had to disconnect the echo dot from the fire tv.It is basically a glorified light switch (when you buy the plugs that pair with it)  and a weathered and news station.	3	January 16, 2022	1
234	Echo Dot	Over a period of several months, I attempted to set up this item but it would not connect to the internet. I have two other Echo devices that are connected with no problem.  The return policy button on my invoice states it can be replaced through April 2023.  I tried to replace it but was directed to chat with an Amazon representative.  I spent almost 2 hours with a half a dozen different people in chat and no one could get it set up and they refused to replace it.  I sent them a screenshot that stated it could be replaced through April 2023 but they said it only applies to unopened items with the replacement for open items being 90 days and not a year.  Of course the return policy button doesn’t state that.  They also said they couldn’t replace it because it wasn’t registered.  I explained that it needed to be connected to Wi-Fi to register and since it won’t connect, can’t register.  They said I could trade it in and get a refund of the current value, but a $5 refund on a $30 item didn’t appeal to me.  With all of the purchases I make on Amazon, it seems like a bad business practice to harass me so much on a $30 item.  Guess I am just out my $30.	1	August 23, 2022	0
235	Echo Dot	Sometimes Alexa forgets to wake me when she was programed to do so	3	June 5, 2022	1
236	Echo Dot	"Great little smart device with a woman name Alexa inside a machine. I was watching someone's video in the comments here showing the smart light function demonstration (alexa turn on the light) and even my echo dot sitting at the corner in my room woke up to pick up what that person said in the video and told me ""Sorry I didn't find a device name light"". The only problem I ran into was drop in call sometimes doesn't work. Some restarting may resolve this bug but I hope it's not repetitive. I ain't not time to unplug my echo dot every time this happens. Sometimes when music is playing at 3/4 volume, Alexa won't hear me unless I yell at the top of my lung for it to wake. Overall it's an impressive small smart device. I can't wait to try out the smart plug and dimmable color bulb. We just need more Alexa controlled smart device like ""Alexa, flush the toilet"" without having to press down that filthy flush lever or ""Alexa, open the window blinds in the kitchen"" operating the blinds with a motorized device installed at the main headrail. I can go on but that's just giving free ideas to Amazon. I just love being creative. That's what I do, I drink and I know things.Update 10/31/19: There is a loud high pitch squeal  noise coming out of the echo dot when I drop in call from my Alexa app thru my android phone. Making it unbearable to communicate with someone with they drop in call me. Its horrible! 1 star taken away til they somehow fix this or I will just return it."	3	October 31, 2019	1
237	Echo Dot	I have been fighting with this little piece of crap to try and get it to do what I tell it. It won't acknowledged me unless I tell ALEXA!!! and then scream commands at it, which it usually ignores. One night I was hollering at alexa trying to get it to turn off my fan and turn on the bathroom light. It wouldn't acknowledge me so I kept having to yell and yell. my neighbor called the cops because she thought there was a domestic dispute. I had to demonstrate to the officers. Of course alexa listened and obeyed immediately. I had to let them search my property to convince them I lived alone. I was MORTIFIED. I don't know why I keep this little brat around.	2	July 5, 2022	0

I called Amazon support and they could not fix the problem so advised they would send out a different unit and to return the old unit. I promptly receive the new Echo Dot 3 and had the same problem. I then downloaded the Amazon app to my iPhone and it worked - Set-up complete. I then tried it on the other Echo Dot 3 and after two tries using the app on the iPhone set-up was complete.I will keep the unit and ""not return"" it to Amazon. I have not seen another medium to advise Amazon of this other than this.I just thought it was strange that the app work better on the iPhone versus the Android Samsung phone. Still having a problem downloading Contacts to the Echo device so I can make voice calls by name.Bottom line is that I like the product but did not like the problems with the set-up process and difficulty in downloading Contacts so I can use the Echo as a speakerphone. The app also froze several times forcing be to reboot the phone and this was common on my IOS and Android phones. For these reasons and all the time spent working on fixes and researching the How-To for the device, I can only give this product three stars. This is suppose to make life easier, not take hours to set-up. Still working on some issue like Contacts."	3	November 27, 2019	1
242	Echo Dot	This is an inexpensive version of the Alexa.  It will answer a lot of questions but lacks certain sophistication functions.  We did ask Alexa to change her voice to male and we hard-of-hearing seniors can hear him better.  We are learning how to ask questions.  Alexa does not always have all the answers and likes to advertise some pay-for music program.  It finds most of the songs we ask for.  Nice for temperature, rainfall, forecast...	3	March 6, 2022	1

245	Echo Dot	"Sound quality muffled, like talking thru a sock.  Alexa learned my voice but heard a command from a YouTube I was watching and responded to it (the guy had a higher voice and accent.. That's not me). It also takes time for a response, more than Google. Also, I couldn't get it to shut up.  Alexa tried to sign me up for Amazon music unlimited several times, I had to unplug. Very frustrating.Update: the response gets better as you use it. Still can't do multiple questions like Google Nest. I did use the drop in feature after which I accidentally called myself now I have received 20 calls in 8hrs from numbers similar to mine with VM from ""Amazon"" saying someone has accessed my account.  These are spoof calls. Completely annoying.If you are an ""Alexa"" type Echo would be a fit but get the 4rth Gen.  If you like more informative information, or a Google person... It's not for you.An example. I asked both Alexa and Google Assistant ""What's the heat index in Boston""ALEXA: *definition of Heat Index.GA: ""The Heat Index in Boston is 103 degrees Fahrenheit."""	3	June 22, 2021	1
246	Echo Dot	"I'm not sure if this is Pandora's fault, or Amazon's fault, but integration with Pandora is very poor. We mainly use this as a smart music device that also tells time and weather. Everything worked well when we had Amazon's unlimited echo streaming plan, and it normally picked the correct music, but canceled when we got a newer echo (this one) and someone in our household signed up for Pandora with family sharing. Since then, the experience has been mostly poor. Alexa rarely matches against the correct music (that I know exists on Pandora), and quite often plays offensive music, which is not good when it's mostly for my kids. For example, if you ask Alexa to play the Frozen II soundtrack (for the kids), it plays some random trash. Worse, I asked Alexa to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snowman"" for my daughter, and it keeps trying to play ""Do You Want To Build A Snow Dick"".  This last part likely isn't AMZ's fault, but Pandora doesn't have a cast to Alexa option anymore, so there's no way to get at the music that you actually want it to play without using the Echo as a bluetooth speaker... less than ideal... Alexa should just work regardless of service.I'm a big music fan, so I have hundreds of my albums uploaded to Google Music (Amazon's music locker service is long gone)... but unfortunately those are not available on my echo, because Amazon doesn't allow Google Music on their devices. Maybe they will add this one day, as they did with YouTube TV on the Fire devices."	3	December 28, 2019	1
247	Echo Dot	The device itself works as intended. I use it mostly as a speaker for my music and its great. What irritates me is if I gotta change the WiFi, it will stay stuck on setup mode and I’ve done everything everybody recommends to reassure the device can connect.	2	September 17, 2022	0
248	Echo Dot	"I'm going with 2 stars because when it is working, the dot is super convenient. I love being able to just ask what the weather is going to be that day or ask how long it's going to take me to get somewhere. However, every single echo dot that I have owned has stopped being able to ""hear"" me, or just has stopped responding to my questions after about a year and a half. I don't know if it's the fact that it stays plugged in all the time, or if it's just not meant to last for more than a year or so? It's just very frustrating and disappointing. I shouldn't have to replace something every year or two. I rely on my echo dot as an alarm clock so when my alarm goes off earlier than my husband has to get up and for whatever reason all of the sudden Alexa can't hear me anymore, it just keeps going and going and going and I have to get up to unplug the entire dot to get out to stop. I am very frustrated by this and will be switching to Google home in hopes that it does not have the same issues."	2	January 31, 2022	0
249	Echo Dot	"This was my second Echo Dot so ,obviously I like them, but when I went to set it up I had issues it wouldn't connect to the internet. After going to the Amazon troubleshooting site, and trying everything there. I decided to use the pop up virtual assistant. I was then connected to a ""tech"" by phone which they asked for my number. After being reassured he would fix the issue and have it running by the time the call ended, he remoted into my computer, said I had all these issues installed a network security program which ""protected the network and everything on it"" he asked for $500.00. when I told him I didn't have the money he hung up on me. I got suspicious and deleted the program he installed, scanned my system with my security and did the cleanups I know about. Two days later I got 8 calls about fraudulent charges on my amazon account. I really got nervous because I never gave him any of my account numbers at all. So I called Amazon to inquire about the charges they reassured me my account was fine, I explained what happened and they said they would never ask to remote into someones computer and I needed to change all my passwords. They logged the numbers I got calls from and said they would look into this. I then called my internet service to change the password and was told I should bring my computer into an IT person just in case something was installed I didn't know about. I just got my computer back and they did fine suspicious programs on my system. so much for a great Prime day deal of 20 it ended up costing me $150.:( And I still couldn't get the dot to connect, finally I had to use my phone, which I don't like doing.

I am not sure why it took so long.I set it up and was VERY disappointed in the sound. I am not a sound techy person and didn't have a problem with the sound of the Gen 2.  Yes it is a little tinny and music has almost no bass so I was expecting an improvement in the Gen 3.  Not only is there no improvement but it is actually worse.  It sounds like it is stuffed in a sock or something.  The sound is very muffled.  I went to the EQ and took out all of the bass, almost all of the midrange and pushed treble as high as it would go.  It is some better but still not right.  I can not imagine why they would have killed the sound this way. If they weren't going to improve it they could have left it alone.  With the new look they still could have sold it as a new version.	3	December 22, 2020	1
258	Echo Dot	There is a fake alexa startup app. that leads you through promps that eventually fail . Then they provide a toll free number that is just set up to scam you into buying a security system for your computer. Make sure you install the right alexa app. Get your kid to insure its  authentic.	2	September 4, 2022	0

262	Echo Dot	The echo dot speaker doesn’t sound any better than an equally priced JBL speaker that is bluetooth for the same price however you do need it plugged it. It does have voice recognition but since I already have an iPhone and iPad Siri helps me out better anyway. I guess the Echo Dot can make animal noises if you ask it to.	3	March 30, 2022	1
263	Echo Dot	"nice little home thingy. do have to say you should only go for these if all your stuff is through the zon, doesn't play all that well with my android phone and pc with all the media already on it that I want to play.got a google one and it plays much better for me with my stuff, but this one is still nice for backround music and misc stuff. maybe get this one for your bedroom and the more robust version for the living room.*EDIT* might be crapping out on me after less than 2 weeks? sometimes just stops playing music for seemingly no reason. also you have to be so literal it will miss simple requests and be like early jeopardy watson like ""did you mean harry potter?"" when you ask for the weather. OOF"	3	October 2, 2021	1
264	Echo Dot	There are many things I love about having an Alexa.  If my family is only listening to music on one device it's totally fine, but I wanted something that I could have one song in one room and another on in another room. I thought it was supposed to be able to do that,  it's why I bought it.  Now it just causes trouble with my kids fighting over who gets to listen to music each night.  😠	3	February 22, 2022	1
265	Echo Dot	"Numerous small issues.When you set a timer, it's local to that device. So if you set a timer in the kitchen for, say, cookies or something, then go to another room, that timer will only go off in the kitchen even if you have an echo dot by your computer.The app is annoying; it needs a ""duplicate routine"" option for if you need to make multiple similar routines. For example, if you make a routine for ""I'm in the den"" which turns off all the lights except the ones in the den, and then you want to make an ""I'm in the living room,"" you can't just copy and edit the first one. You have to set it up from scratch, which in my apartment means setting six individual lights to off and one on. Each of those is selected from a menu, then you set options in sub menus, so something that should take less then a minute ends up taking up to ten. Plus if you accidentally hit ""back"" it drops all progress and starts over. And there's no option to create routines on PC in a browser where it would be more convenient.The echo dot often doesn't understand what I say. Sometimes I have to repeat commands up to three times.Alexa never shuffles playlists when I ask her to play music, which is only a minor annoyance but it's still annoying.There's a ton of potential for this to be awesome in the next generation, but for now it's just okay. The device itself would get another star if the app was better."	3	October 9, 2019	1
266	Echo Dot	does not know as much as google	3	June 1, 2022	1
267	Echo Dot	Not as smart as you would like it to be for sure. What I like the most about smart devices is that they save you time and make things better with easier steps. This wasn't the case here. I got 2 dots and thought to myself I will make a smart surrounding sounds system. It failed miserably. First the Routines on the Alexa app sucks especially when you have more than 1 device. When it connects to your phone, only one device can play the sound for some reason. The 2 devices works only on Amazon music, which I thought is fine, I'm not opposing it but then the app is so laggy. The devices can't follow complex demands. And it can't even save your answer for a question they ask me every day. This is a big fail for me. The sound quality is alright though.	2	May 13, 2022	0
268	Echo Dot	"I bought this because it was a good deal and I haven't tried ""Alexa"" before just Google. I found her to be great at hearing your voice but for answering simple questions, not great. I like the fact that it's hooked up to Amazon because I do a lot of shopping there. I will continue to use Alexa for my Amazon music and stuff. I would still recommend it!"	3	March 15, 2022	1
269	Echo Dot	"Sonds better that the original one I had that wouldn't connect to the internet so I threw it as far as I could after being on the phone with Amazon technical support for over an hour.

270	Echo Dot	I was using it for home integration and its hard to start out with. You have to use loopholes to configure it to other smart home devices that I have. Overall 4/5 but 3/5 due to poor integration	3	April 25, 2022	1

273	Echo Dot	I give this device 1 star because it doesn't respect settings set via the Alexa app. Specifically, I use Spotify. When I ask Alexa to play a playlist using this device, it never finds it because it insists on using Amazon Music. I've selected Spotify as the default music service through the Alexa app (note: can't do this on web!), and it still refuses to understand. The end result is any time I ask it to play a playlist on Spotify, it can't because it's looking on Amazon Music - or worse, it plays some random song from Amazon Music that I don't want. It's incredibly frustrating and, consequently, I wouldn't recommend it.The audio quality is pretty good though. It can also get loud. It's just a shame that a device I want to use for playing music can't play music because Amazon can't figure out that I want to use a service other than Amazon Music.	1	October 3, 2022	0
274	Echo Dot	Played music on it at work, 50 hours per week. And the speaker is so blown now we can’t understand the words	3	May 14, 2022	1
275	Echo Dot	My Echo dot works fine. I'm glad I have it. Just angry that Amazon would send me an email about a week after purchase to rub it in that the Echo Dot I just bought can now be purchased for much less .... I guess in case I wanted to get another one .... sorry still upset because I don't have money to burn.	3	March 9, 2022	1
276	Echo Dot	I got this to replace Google Home.  It is not at all the same. It does not learn and doesn’t understand basic commands.  If I say “turn on the lights”, it doesn’t know what that means, unless I create a group of switches called “the lights”.  Everything has to be literal and no matter how many times you do something, it does not learn.  Being used to Google Home, I am very disappointed with Alexa.	2	August 12, 2022	0
277	Echo Dot	finally upgraded from the very first alexa tower from years ago (it fell and broke).  must shout commands at it 3-4 times, would vastly prefer the original, this is NOT an improvement AT ALL.  voice recognition extremely spotty, if at all.  it just simply does not respond.  have taken to screamig at it to make it work, which it then intermittently does.	2	August 18, 2022	0
278	Echo Dot	Makes signing into xbox live a 2step process instead of one. It's easier to just use the remote because you have to grab it anyway to put in your security code. With wifi 6 smart tech it can't communicate with other items when they are sleep or off due to wifi 6 disconnecting sleeping or unused network items items must remain on and in use for wifi 6 to keep them active on the network for alexa to communicate with.	2	August 10, 2022	0
279	Echo Dot	The product had amazing sound but would not play more then a few songs and shut off.  I have an Echo Dot 2 and they would not connect.  I can ask my echo dot 2 to play the rolling stones and it will literally play for days.  I would ask the echo dot 3 and it was a crap shoot.  I have the echo dots to play  music 24 hours a day.  I have 2 little dogs and I have found if I play music all the time they are more calm as the outside noises of apartment living are kept at a minimum.  The echo dot would not perform in that manner.  I tried to connect the two of them and it looked good on the ipad but they never connected to play the same music thru out the apt.  I would come home and the echo 3 would be off and I would have a panicked dog.  Not cool.  Amazon Sent me a new echo dot 3 and it lasted for maybe 2 months... the speakers sounded blown.  Amazon sent me a return label...  Since I love my echo dot 2 I have ordered an echo show 5 and I am praying I love it!!  I have had more good luck with amazon products then bad so I am willing to continue using their products.  They did refund me for the echo dot 3!  Thank You Amazon for standing behind your products!!	3	December 16, 2019	1
280	Echo Dot	My Echo Dot was a kind gift replacement for a bedside radio alarm, including some lists and reminders provided by the giver.  My house appliances are not electronically automated (I still know how to turn switches on and off), I don't use other voice activated aids nor do I remember command key words readily (so if I say the wrong key word, Alexa has no idea what I want, leaving me to scratch my muddled brain about appropriate synonyms), and I feel it's kind of creepy talking to a dumb computer voice which hasn't been adequately programed to search for my music or queries. Nor is the cell phone app very helpful for finding how to use features which I haven't yet realized that I might not need. Nor is the Amazon Prime Music library very complete, for the kind of classical and jazz music that I like without paying another monthly fee (Pandora - if I could attach to it -  provides a much broader Station association between my song and others I might thumbs up). But it is nice to be reminded to take my nighttime pills or to have Dot tune in to my favorite on-line radio station when I say 'Alexa, Good Morning,' with great sound quality, as long as she hasn't changed the volume to blast me out of the room since the last time.	3	August 7, 2020	1
281	Echo Dot	My 9 year old received this as a gift. After setting up free time and subscribing to kindle unlimited we set it up using his preexisting kindle profile. Alexa works with specific commands which doesn’t seem like a problem at the time but when she only recognizes your voice 25% of the time it’s a bit of a pain. All 3 members of my household have different accents coast to coast and no luck with echo dot. On top of that she doesn’t recognize the names of a lot of the 3rd party apps for kids. Setting the up routines was a long glitchy process and the math app was not great. Overall it does preform its basic functions which is why I gave it 2 stars. Nothing puts a parent in a great mood like yelling “Read Harry Potter!” 7 times and hearing “Reading Peter Rabbit by Beatrice Potter.” Eventually even the most patient child begins to hate Peter Rabbit all because of Alexa.  After yelling the name of your book 5 times eventually she might get it and if not you can use the phone app.Pros: Can remind kids of chores and will play audiobooks if you open them from your phone.When we were picking out smart speakers for the rest of our home we decided to try Google Home Mini and wow what a difference. Google Home can recognize conversational commands, help kids with math problems, has exceptionally clearer sound in addition to both voice and touch volume controls. So far the only con is figuring out how to edit actions in the middle of the night without google responding verbally. Google will even tell you Alexa has her strengths and Google has hers when you ask who Alexa is. It’s not linked directly to audible but you can play it using the Bluetooth function. It also connects to our smart tv. The only advantage Echo Dot has is a direct connection to order on amazon or audible but given that Alexa opens the wrong book 75% of the time I can only imagine the problems with orders. Our kiddo is jealous and now wants a Google Home mini too.	2	May 26, 2020	0
282	Echo Dot	Had it for years but now it has been operating poorly. Randomly disconnects from the wifi and struggles to listen	3	May 15, 2022	1
283	Echo Dot	This speaker is ok, it’s not what I thought it was and maybe that’s my fault because I assumed instead of reading. The speakers volume is ok but if your having a party or something this is definitely not the speaker for that and the speaker has to be plugged up I thought it was Bluetooth and can just be charged but no. Which is surprising but it was only $20 so you get what you pay for. The price makes sense.	3	January 24, 2022	1
284	Echo Dot	I mostly use it for music and I get it, it’s Amazon not apple so it probably doesn’t completely support Apple Music but it says it does so I feel like it should. I’m not paying for two music streaming services, it’s so frustrating when I ask her to play my music and she’ll say “playing elyssas music from Apple Music” and probably 10% of the music she plays is actually in my playlist. If I wanted to listen to random music I would select a genre. No I want to listen to songs I know the lyrics to and know I like. “Your feedback is saved” no it isn’t you play the same songs over and over no matter how many times I thumbs down. I lost it before I posted this because I told her “skip” about ten times and every song she played wasn’t in my playlist and it was songs I knew and hated. I have like one Kendrick song so she’s always trying to play him even tho I have ONE song that he FEATURES In, it’s not even his song and she’s always playing him and I ALWAYS thumbs him down cos I don’t like his voice at all. I always lose my patience and just tell it to shut up cos I’m not in the mood to listen to music after saying skip/thumbs down 20 times in a row.	2	October 23, 2021	0
285	Echo Dot	I've enjoyed my Alexa and this, the Dot, since setting them up about 6 months ago.  They are pretty easy to set up, voice commands to play songs and adjust the volume work well most of the time, and the sound quality even on the Dot is pretty good.  Plus I can play songs directly from my Amazon Music library.  All good, right? Well, sort of...The thing I DON'T like is that if my wife is playing songs from Amazon Music on her phone or anywhere else, and I ask Alexa to play a song, I can't do it unless I want to pay the $14.99/month unlimited family plan streaming fee.  I understand that Amazon needs to make money, but I already pay $99 per year for Amazon Prime and I buy over half my stuff on Amazon.  Now they want 15 bucks a month just so my wife and I can both enjoy music at the same time?  This is an example of the big guy on the block wanting ALL the money.  I'm annoyed every time I can't play a song.  So If you're the only one streaming music on Alexa, or if you don't mind shelling out another $14.99 per month, then I would recommend Alexa and Alexa Dot.	3	October 10, 2020	1
286	Echo Dot	Delivery was same day - impressive!VERY tough to integrate with existing (same generation) Echo Dot. Once integrated works OK. Sound is OK - not expecting great sound. I do like that I can move from one level to another and same song is playing.	3	April 13, 2022	1

288	Echo Dot	Alexa app is a pain to use. Too many notifications about what you can so with it popping up. Alexa can’t distinguish between smart plugs named “lights” and smart bulbs. Terrible sound quality. I’ll never buy any Alexa enabled device in my life ever again. Although I’m not a fan of Google, at least Google Home assistant is more intelligent and easier to use (yes, you can simply say “all lights on” and Google will turn on everything even if it has “lights” in name). It feels like an Amazon spy in your house. Wanna buy more toilet paper? Alexa will interrupt and tell you that. Sorry Amazon, I’m not interested. Even Bluetooth sucks, because there is no way to lower Alexa’s voice and increase bluetooth volume (and yes I increased volume on my phone). Point for mute button.	1	October 14, 2022	0
289	Echo Dot	"We bought this to replace our Google mini that died due to a widespread glitch in a Google update. Our Alexa Dot seems sturdier than the mini- hopefully it will last longer? That said, it's much harder to use. It was a real pain to set up ( how we'll ever remotely be able to direct nursing home staff to set up Mom's replacement for her Google mini, I have no idea! She relied on her mini to wake her up, tell her weather and answer a myriad of questions she has). The dot is more finicky about asking for stuff in exact words- getting it to open my favorite radio station takes some tongue-twisting. It requires a lot of ""skills"" to be downloaded from the app ( like a separate skill for each separate radio station or background sound you want) in order to more easily recognize your request- each skill an app that you have to search out and download. Also, Alexa's sense of humor is TERRIBLE! ( we loved asking funny stuff of our Google mini. Maybe this will get better as Alexa ""gets to know us""?) The responses have been beyond flat with the Dot. Hopefully a lot of this is just a slow learning curve, but we shall see. Definitely not as intuitive as the Google mini, that's for sure!"	3	September 2, 2020	1
290	Echo Dot	If all you would use this for is to ask for information which is only for spoken Alexa then it’s perfect but for music I think it’s poor quality got this free from Bestbuy with TV purchase. Took me a whole year to take it out the box and set it up, overall it’s okay nothing major for good quality music poor bass.	2	August 22, 2022	0
291	Echo Dot	Ok, Would be nice to have a clock like the higher priced ones. Still don’t know if to trust any of these listening devices.	3	May 10, 2022	1
292	Echo Dot	Glad it was free with a Sirius xm renewal. Easy to set up and it is convenient to use but it will not after 3 hrs on phone with product support recognize or control Philip's hue lamps. Turns out this had to do with the broadcast frequency of my wifi and what frequency the hue and the echo will work on. Been so long now I forget the exact details but it is unacceptable that Alexa tech support could not figure this out. I sent the hues back. Got alexa plugs and while hard to set up and get them all in the same group, they work well.  After living with Alexa for a few years now, my opinion is that it is needlessly complicated because of trying to be everything to everyone. Too many ways to do the same thing when just one way would be fine. And why would anyone want the thing chiming or glowing in the middle of the night because the status of an amazon order changed and it does the same thing if you set a routine. Totally aggrevating and totally unnecessary.  The best thing I have found that this thing is good for is along with the plug modules, I can turn on a light in every room of my house with a single voice command from my bedroom.  This is why I bought it and the plugs. Other than that, I could do without it.	3	February 3, 2020	1
293	Echo Dot	UPDATE:So it would seem that echo dot is less user friendly than my initial impression.- If you are 5ft+ away from it, or if there is any other sounds in the room, or if there is any obstacle between you and the dot, it starts to not hear you or misidentify your command even when you already raised your voice. The further away you are the worse this gets.- I cannot get it to stop blinking yellow notification. I've read multiple sites on how people turn off notification for tip of day, mail, etc. but it still blinks and gives me that tip of day crap. It should've be a very simple configuration and it should work the way I want it, not having me looking up sites after sites for configuration for a simple option maybe just because amazon wants to showcase their featureBecause my sole purpose of getting it is just to give me accurate voice command capability of lights/electronics around the house and not give me unsolicited information. I'll say it around 2.5 star for me at this time.----------------------------------Overall setup is very simple for someone who is somewhat familiar with technologies and can follow instructions.The dot is smaller than I remembered but has surprisingly good sound quality for such small device. It is very nice looking imo and can recognize my command very well. It does sometimes have trouble picking up my voice about 10+ ft away in my fairly opened living room/kitchen/dining room area, I'll have to test this further as it was quite noisy in the room at the time.I also have non-amazon brand smart switches setup and the Alexa app was able to pick it up. I was very impressed because it asked me which room the light switch was at and setup the light switch all by itself without any manual intervention on my part.I got the three-dot deal and one of the box seem to have been opened previously because the seal sticker on the box has been teared off, however the inner plastic wrapping seems intact. As the dot seem to be functioning flawlessly and it seems too big a hassle to return it, I am just going to keep it but just throwing this out there for whoever might care - check your factory seal.I am actually in the process of recommending a smart home system to an elderly relative who would prefer foreign language voice command. I think this might be a feature where amazon falls short of but otherwise I am perfectly happy with this system.	2	November 30, 2019	0

295	Echo Dot	The Echo Dot refuses to answer incoming calls even though the cell phone is linked to the device..  I spent more than 70 minutes with Amazon device support and she was unable to fix the problem.  There should be a simple Let Alexa Answer Incoming Calls setting but instead, there are a half dozen related settings scattered around.  Regardless, even with all of them set properly it still does not detect the incoming call.  Asking Alexa to answer the call results in a no incoming calls reply.	3	December 26, 2021	1
296	Echo Dot	I had a google home and tried to change over to the echo dot. It's just not as smart or as capable as google home. Maybe if I got everything from Amazon it'd be different but I'm not switching my whole life over to that. So if you're 100% amazon integrated it could be good for you. Sound is decent though.	3	March 4, 2022	1

301	Echo Dot	One of my other ones, a year old, died so I ordered this one to replace it.  This one is definitely diff from my older version ones.  This one, in a room downstairs, would respond to my commands instead of the one a few feet away from me in the same room upstairs.  So I switched those two.  I commented on the difference and then I believe it made some adjustments because it asked me a few times after that if the correct echo dot responded.This one has a more bass tuned voice and I don't like it as well as the way my previous ones sound.  It is less clear. I think it is probably to give music a better sound if you use it to play through its builtin speaker but I don't.  I have BT speakers for music.  I haven't checked to see if you can alter the bass/treble.This one has a cloth wrap on it and a bit rounder shape, I don't really care about that, I thought the other ones were fine and probably would stay cleaner or at least be easier to clean since they are all hard plastic.  Not that I've actually cleaned any of them lol.  Anyhow it provides the same functionality for me and that is what I wanted.	3	June 1, 2020	1
302	Echo Dot	Alexa is fine for keeping track of what I need from the store, but a few months ago, the TuneIn feature became, to my deep dismay, ubiquitous. I bought several Alexas to listen to radio stations etc, but suddenly, commercials appeared on TuneIn and consistently interrupted my enjoyment. Especially the ads for services that aren’t relevant. And the ones that pop up during discussion programs. I’m thinking about ditching the Alexas and listening to music via other routes, and using them for shopping lists. Which to me is a huge disappointment and a waste of money	2	July 9, 2022	0

304	Echo Dot	I purchased three of these during Prime Days.  First, it took FOREVER for me to receive them, and I still have not received one of the three ordered.Secondly, the only music platform that seems to work correctly is Amazon music.  On any other platform, the song gets about a quarter of the way to halfway finished and it cuts out to dead air.  When the music resumes, a new song is playing.  I listen to pandora primarily, then apple music and Amazon as my last option.  I purchased them to add easily accessible music in my office, gym, and yoga room.  I contacted amazon and did troubleshooting with no resolution.  They sent me two replacements that are doing the same thing.  The funny thing is if I listen to my second-generation dots and plus I have no issues with any of my music platforms.  It is only the third-generation with the problem; which tells me there is something wrong with this third-generation.  I hope they will take this back and return my money.  I would rather have a refurbished second-generation than not to be able to listen to all of my music platforms.Thirdly, the echo says it is up to date, BUT the tech support representative stated that the software version is not the latest.Lastly, I have to repeat myself multiple times for this echo to wake up and do what is asked.  In my opinion, Amazon had to throw a bunch together to keep up with demand from Prime Days and manufactured a bunch of defective echo dots.I hardly ever do reviews, but I am so annoyed with this situation that I had to let others know what to expect.  This third-generation is not the high-quality Amazon product you have become accustomed.  Do yourself a favor and wait until a new generation becomes available or buy an old one.	1	August 27, 2019	0

306	Echo Dot	I like music in my environment.  When Google / YouTube went to subscription-only music, I retired my Google Home for Alexa and the Alexa Dot.  I am already paying for Prime, so I might as well enjoy the Amazon Music through Alexa.  I bought this Dot in September, so you know I've given it more than a shot at impressing me.The combination of Amazon Music and Dot/Alexa is inconsistent at best, frustrating at worst.  I can't tell you whether the problem is with Alexa/Dot or Amazon Music, but I usually have no problem with Amazon Music when I play it through my laptop.  The problems? Sometimes I have to ask Alexa twice to play a music station.  The first time she will confirm the station I've requested... then silence.  Nothing.  So I ask again.  And music...  Sometimes I ask to play a station and  the music starts, then stops after one song... or two songs... or ten minutes... or continues to play (my preferred action) until I tell it to stop.  Sometimes I think it's the act of 'asking', so I use my app.  The same inconsistencies.  And frequently an ad pops up on my app asking if I want to pay MORE for Amazon Music.  Really?  I'm auditioning your service everyday.  You're not winning my money.I'm not sure how I'm going to resolve this.  Pay for another music service? Go back to Google Home?  But I wanted to get my frustrations in front of people.  With 4.5 stars after over a million reviews, I think proclaiming my disappointed in this product will make little difference.  Amazon.  Are you listening?  Something is wrong with this.	2	February 24, 2021	0

308	Echo Dot	"I have mixed feelings about the Echo Dot.  I do like the convenience it has with just speaking a command to the Dot.  I also like the portability of just plugging it in anywhere, as long as you have wi-fi. .We use it for music 95% of the time.  On the down side ,it gets confused about certain playlists we try to activate.  About 50% of the time, it will stop  playing for no reason and when we ask why, we get ""stopped due to inactivity"".  Why do we need to be active with it, it's supposed to be playing music.  This seems to be a common issue with this device per the forums I have read.  As many posts that I have read on this, you would think that Amazon would have this issue resolved by now.  Some of the posts I read are dated over a year ago.  At the end of the day, I would have to say the Echo Dot is just an ""OK"" device.  The negatives take away from the positives.  I doubt I would ever purchase another one."	3	March 23, 2021	1

310	Echo Dot	I disliked the fact I could not connect it to my TCL smart tv, XBox One, and Vizio smart tv. Otherwise it works great.	3	April 30, 2022	1
311	Echo Dot	This model is not worth getting. The sound quality is pretty good, and the things you can tell it to do is pretty comprehensive. The only problem is when playing music, she gets hard of hearing. It's like yelling at a teenager because it takes 3 or 4 yells for Alexa to respond :/	3	March 12, 2022	1
312	Echo Dot	"Alexa doesn't speak Chinese for voice commands, even though Alexa / Echo Dot (Gen 3) can translate English into Chinese when asked, ""Alexa, what's ----- in Chinese?"". If you use this to listen to C-pop: Alexa absolutely CANNOT find songs, playlists, or artists in Chinese. For example, artist 'Shinyen' was pronounced (in English) ""Shuh-NYE-en"". That's 'NYE' as in 'hair-dye'. (rolling eyes emoji) Please add 中文 (Chinese) as a dual-lanugage option paired with English for the United States. An even better advanced feature would be a Polyglot option with the ability to select one or more primary languages for those of us in a multi-language home. Also: Indigenous Lanugages PLEASE! All of America is traditionally Indigenous Land."	3	October 31, 2021	1
313	Echo Dot	This is a great little device for setting up reminders to get things done. It’s also a good back up alarm clock. I also use it for podcasts and music. The only shortcoming I see at the moment is that it will respond to anyone who calls its name.	3	March 15, 2022	1
314	Echo Dot	I bought two of these last Christmas since they were cheaper than the normal price, and I am trying hard not to get rid of them. When I ask a simple question, I do not need the Gettysburg Address as a response. Actual example: I asked what time it was. After giving me the time, it proceeded to let me know multiple things that I can ask it that had absolutely nothing to do with the time. Another example: I asked what the date was. After telling me the date, it said 'did you know I can also order cleaning supplies for you? Ask me...'?! I've already done a bunch of online searching and toggled all of the things in the app that my searches told me to turn off, and yet as others have mentioned on message boards, it continues to do it.Was this review helpful? If it was, by the way I can also tell you the top 10 most purchased spatulas and the average annual temperature in Patterson, New Jersey. Try asking me things like...	2	February 4, 2022	0
315	Echo Dot	I’ve complained on multiple occasions to Alexa phone support only to be told that they will write a trouble ticket and forward to their team …without ANY resolve!Here’s the problem, like most of you I have a select amount of Pandora stations which I frequently listen to. Up until 3 months ago I was able to listen to Kap Slap Radio (on Pandora). When I tell Alexa to play that station she instead plays Cap One Radio (which isn’t worth listening). I used to be able to request that station without a hitch, but something has happened (I’m guessing during an update).As I mentioned before, Alexa support is useless and does nothing to correct this issue!!!***Update - So a day after posting my review, I recieved a voicemail from someone at Amazon saying that they'd like to speak with me to try and make things better... I called them back right away and it was only a generic Amazon customer service number (so there was no way to get in touch with Timothy).I also received an email stating to reach them back otherwise they won't reach back out to me again. Basically, it was simple formalities for someone leaving a negative review for an Amazon product. Very Disappointing!!!	1	July 22, 2022	0
316	Echo Dot	I've bought Alexa from the 1st generation and on.  What I've noticed,  is that over time even as I upgraded to the newest generation. They improved, but voice recognition sucks. It's too sensitive sometimes and you have to scream at it other times.  I wish I invested in a different product. Sound quality sucks even with the echo.  I have 3 dots and 1 echo.  I get more angry at Alexa every year I have her around.	3	January 11, 2022	1
317	Echo Dot	Got this on a Prime Day bundle with a LIFX smart bulb. Therein lies the problem. Overall, Alexa seems to work well most of the time. But I have two issues with the Echo Dot/Alexa.First is the voice quality. When Alexa speaks it's very muddy. If there's any background noise it's very difficult to understand her. Surprisingly though, when I play music through the Echo Dot it sounds remarkably good. Much better than I anticipated from a speaker so small. IMO, better than the Google (Nest) Home Mini.Second is the integration with the LIFX bulb. Often Alexa will respond that the bulb cannot be located. Then some random number of days pass and she will suddenly see the bulb again. Then 1-3 days later, she looses it again. Very frustrating considering Amazon chose to bundle this bulb with the Echo and it's so unreliable. When she can't find it, Google Assistant and Homekit both have no trouble at all.On the plus side, integration with Amazon services is great. And she's been extremely reliable interfacing with my Sonos One SL speaker. I can ask for any music on Sirius/XM, Apple Music or Amazon Music and she always comes through!	3	December 6, 2020	1
318	Echo Dot	When this product works, it works very well. Other times it can't understand what you're asking for, and for one suggested topic, it just goes in circles. I'm in a group where we're using Alexa, and we're supposed to get the daily health tip, but instead I get the daily joke; and for the daily aphorism, I get a loop of nonsense. I do like the chair yoga program but it's hard to get Alexa to stop at the end. Although I didn't think of using Alexa to contact Amazon when the wrong product was delivered. That might have been helpful.	3	November 28, 2021	1
319	Echo Dot	Sometimes Alexa will announce something about a product it thinks it heard in a conversation or ask if we want more information about it without first been addressed by name. Makes me wonder just how much conversation is being collected by  Mr Bezos for his later listening pleasure or marketing plans.	3	March 12, 2022	1
320	Echo Dot	Recognize my voice but Amazon music is very repetitive I have to download another app and pay for it probably having a really hard time connecting to my TV I don’t know if it’s worth it or not	3	April 6, 2022	1
321	Echo Dot	You can't utilize all of its features because they charge you for every little thing.	3	May 10, 2022	1
322	Echo Dot	Works horribly with Spotify. Forces you to use an alexa app and doesn’t allow you to cast from Spotify app. Very frustrating. The alexa app doesn’t let you find music and linking it with more than one is a pain. Also the sound quality is very bad especially with bass	2	August 25, 2022	0
323	Echo Dot	Decent functionality, but I get better sound from a string and two cups.	3	May 13, 2022	1
324	Echo Dot	After having it for less than a year she stopped responding to her wake word until I said it maybe 3-4 times. Wouldn’t recommend.	2	September 24, 2022	0
325	Echo Dot	The only thing she does really is Play song tell me the weather most of the time she gets you something's wrong and have to keep telling her repeatedly	2	September 20, 2022	0
326	Echo Dot	It’s exactly the same as my Alexa Echo except one VERY important thing. (At least to me) The sound. If you turn this dot all the way up you can stand over it and have a perfect conversation over it and music is not up I can’t even say loud because this will not get close to loud. So if you want it for a child’s room for music or anything it would be perfect. But not for everyday stuff. I use mine (Echo) for timers, music, and white noise. But I have to move it around, so I bought this one thinking it exactly the same except smaller, so I’ll put the big one upstairs and the smaller one in the living room. But, no I was going to return it, but it will be fine for the kid’s playroom, they will just never be able to “turn it up”Example volume 5 on my Echo sounds about the same as volume 10 on the dot	3	June 28, 2021	1
327	Echo Dot	This was a gift to us because we liked the sound quality of the same unit my sister-in-law has. I've heard too many negative things about the privacy as far as what it hears, and I've also heard it can prompt young children to do not such good things. We only use it on occasion for music, and little else, (used it a lot for holiday music over the holidays) otherwise it sits turned off, or in a cupboard.	3	January 6, 2022	1
328	Echo Dot	"Alexa is limited as to what she can tell you and gives up after one try. Frustrating when trying to get information, and she will keep going to the same website. She definitely won't replace a computer for research. Alexa can also be wordy / annoying when trying to help - having to interrupt her to say stop. Amazon music is overall disappointing as the same genre songs are played over and over - you wind up specifying songs and artists. ""Play more like this"" gives you one extra song by the artist - then Alexa plays the same old repertoire ad nausium. Not every song you can think of is available, and Alexa will pick the latest artist if the song is a remake - annoying when you want to hear the original (or don't know the artist of the original song.) Another person with another account lives with me, and their Echo 3 dot plays song through mine, even though they are on separate accounts and in different rooms and not within earshot of the other (how does that happen?) You wind up unplugging Alexa to avoid unwanted music. Pluses are the great sound quality - Alexa's ability to understand you and respond from a distance. Annoyances aside - I'll think I'll keep her!"	3	July 25, 2020	1
329	Echo Dot	"First off - I love my Alexa and I've gone all in on these things.  We have the big Echo in the kitchen and a dot in all three bedrooms (with another one in the garage attached to one of those chargers that lets me take it outside wirelessly).What infuriates me is that I pay fifteen bucks a month for a family plan so that my son can listen to Old Town Road on a loop in one room, my daughter can sing along with Elsa in her room, and my wife and I can rock out to Deer Tick downstairs.  That's the American dream, right?But it's JUST a dream.  If you tell the dot in my son's room to play sleep sounds, it turns off Nora Jones Radio downstairs and starts playing Ocean Waves there instead of in his room.  I've tried naming the device with the Alexa app and saying ""Play Rain Forest Sounds in Jackson's Room"" but it will inevitably turn OFF the Little Mermaid soundtrack in my daughter's room and play it in there anyway - causing her to get out of bed and complain when I just want them to go to sleep.I figured out a delicate order that will bring balance if I start with the Disney music or audiobook of Harry Potter in her room and THEN tell Alexa to play sounds  in his room with a seemingly endless list of commands (""play rain forest sounds"" ""No, I do not want to pay extra for HD quality forest sounds"" ""enable loop"") but then we're married to sitting in silence downstairs until we go to bed because we don't want to risk changing the noises in their rooms by asking for some Langhorne Slim while we relax on the couch.But of course, if I've got something I'm grooving to during the day downstairs, my son is inevitably going to go into his room and ask for Megadeath (where the HECK did he learn what Megadeath is?! I'm looking at you, Uncle Steve) and, while his room remains quiet, my Frightened Rabbit disappears and it's Symphony of Destruction blasting into my living room.What the heck am I paying for a family plan for?  Maybe I ought to have just one Alexa device that I move from room to room.  When you ask a device to produce some kind of sound, why isn't it THAT device that responds?"	1	September 15, 2020	0
330	Echo Dot	The Dot does not seem to process requests as well as our old/original style Alexa. It’s possible that it’s the operators fault since he doesn’t keep updated with the massive amount of information emailed to him. Still it can be quite frustrating.	3	March 20, 2022	1
331	Echo Dot	It listens to what I say and I get emails about anything I say. Case in point was talking to. Someone about a conversation I had with someone in Arabic and I started getting emails on how to. Speak Arabic.  So not want that.	2	August 27, 2022	0
332	Echo Dot	"Constantly bombarded with 'her' saying, ""by the way..."" when I set an alarm, timer, ask the weather, etc. I don't need 'her' constantly annoying me with useless information or targeted marketing. And there is absolutely no way to turn it off! From Amazon Customer Service: ""Alexa occasionally provides feature hints or other information she believes to be useful to customers and there is no setting for turning these off currently.""I cannot wrap my head around why there is no way to completely turn off “by the way..” notifications. I understand that this feature might be useful to some, and is probably a good marketing technique generally. It makes sense to have it on as a default, then, but to have no option to opt out if you find it annoying and invasive?? That’s such a turn-off. I’m researching other smart devices, because this is annoying beyond belief."	2	March 23, 2022	0
333	Echo Dot	I kept it but echo really lacks mid-range & treble. I was going to buy Samuel Jackson's voice but he does not have skills. Not only that but apparently Amazon realized he was popular so the price went from a buck to $5. I was rushed for time or otherwise this would have been returned. So you know my hearing has issues in the higher range, however I can hear mid & higher ranges well with other speakers. This speaker down fires into the plastic base & has been noted by others its muffled sound. Then Alexa's low nasal voice tone amplify's the problem.Addition 8/8/21  I found another voice just by asking Alexa to change her voice. It is a male and heenunciates, not the nasal verbage from Alexa. Note - don't even consider using logic questions with Alexa, its an act of frustration.	3	August 1, 2021	1
334	Echo Dot	The second quality is very low	3	May 15, 2022	1
335	Echo Dot	The sound quality, at least with this one, was very poor. We gave it away.	3	May 5, 2022	1
336	Echo Dot	It does not live up to the hype. It can do a few cute tricks, but you cannot … I repeat CANNOT … depending on this device or the app to do anything important. It simply isn’t reliable and it’s more frustrating than helpful.  I end up #%?!$ by the time I get the dumb thing to cooperate.As if all of that isn’t bad enough, this device is just one big ad for Amazon.  When requesting a skill be performed, get ready for a commercial.None of this is easy to set up. At least not if you are trying to integrate it into a smart home.Like I said , if you just want a cute device to perform parlor tricks and tell you jokes, this is the one for you !	2	April 24, 2022	0
337	Echo Dot	If Alexa is an “assistant” using artificial “intelligence”, then why is it more inconvenient to use and interactions leave me cursing her for being stupid? After two years of using two Echo Dot’s, I’ve decided these things are really only good for listening to music (with Amazon Music of course, which is crap) and pretty decent for turning on/off smart lights. But ask her to perform simple routines and you get a lot of “hmm, I don’t know that one.” She’s useless! The majority of the “smart” features require me to use the app. Want Alexa to turn on a light at a certain time… break out the app and program a routine, because asking her to do that is impossible. I have more frustrating arguments with her than intelligent assistance. Bottom line, buy a Bluetooth speaker, use any number of Alexa app alternatives (Apple HomeKit, Google Home, IFTTT, etc. - there are dozens out there) and leave Alexa sitting on the virtual store shelf where she can assist at the only things she’s good at… being in the way and collecting dust. Seriously, what good is a virtual assistant that you have to do everything yourself in an app? When Siri is better at being an AI than your product is, you’ve got problems… Amazon! And I’m not anti-Amazon in any way. Just telling it like it is. Alexa is basically Phoebe, but ask her to sing Smelly Cat and you’ll likely get “hmm, I don’t know that one.”	2	August 19, 2021	0
338	Echo Dot	So mine had a tone and would make me repeat stuff... and the commercials on my tv was going to what it was saying... like a demon. I hit it with a hammer threw it away. I paid $1 on a discount also... was $50 on sale for $1 with 1 month of amazon music... which by the way doesnt link youtube videos on the xfinity flex amazon music app... alexa also wasnt compatible with the xfinity flex box...The box also is sturdy and hard to damage and makes u angry cus it was being rude and controlling my tv commercials being creepy and demonic... I hate amazon now...I want a refund and explanation kinda scary.	1	October 12, 2022	0
339	Echo Dot	This is the entry level, Echo to the entire Amazon echo world. However, you will be very bitterly disappointed at this entry-level speaker. The sound is truly awful and it mimics that of a very cheap speaker. It is almost impossible to hear the speaking voice for directions and request by ALEXA. Any type of music has muffled sound very very poor mid range if any mid range at all. This is the worst sound from the worst speaker you will ever hear. If you are interested in getting into the a LEX a world by an echo that is a step up from this one. Do not get this one.	1	October 16, 2022	0
340	Echo Dot	I’m sure user error but I tried to make a to do list and the next day it couldn’t find it. Other than that and music not sounding the best on it it’s good.	3	April 6, 2022	1
341	Echo Dot	"My husband bought our very first Alexa for my birthday because he thought I'd enjoy the ""company"" since I work from home. We've not even had it for a year, and the one he bought me now only acknowledges the wake word, but doesn't do anything you ask it. Even after factory resetting it multiple times, and even though it's never been dropped, damaged, or wet. I contacted customer support and was told these devices only have a 90 day warranty, so our best bet is to just buy another one when they go on sale next. We've bought 5 other devices since the first, and now we're worried that all 5 will eventually fail like the first one. Not sure this is worth the $200+ every year if they're all going to go out like this one, especially with the limited amount of stuff they actually do. The only real thing we use them for is playing music while we do chores (which is great when your hands are soapy, dirty, or covered in oil), or turning off the lights when we're on the couch and in bed and don't want to have to get up again to turn them off. It is at least cool that you can group the devices together and then play music on all of them at once if you want, or that you can drop in on other rooms instead of yelling at each other. Other than that, how can we justify spending that kind of money on something that won't last and is just an ""okay"" speaker otherwise? It's just like my Apple Watch - expensive and useful in theory, but in practice not worth the badge. You use it for a couple of things, but it's definitely not as useful as they've told us."	2	September 30, 2020	0
342	Echo Dot	Stops playing because it keeps saying there’s been no activity!  It’s because I’m listening to the music!!!!  Bought for my business but is always shutting off. Gonna have to figure something else out.	3	March 28, 2022	1
343	Echo Dot	When it works, it is a fantastic device; got it during the buy a 1 month subscription of Amazon Music, get a free Alexa and very happy with my purchase.When it doesn’t work however - Alexa can only know so much; sometimes she’ll either give you the wrong answer (Alexa assuming a similar question) or she won’t know.And then when she doesn’t know, Amazon has a program that allows Amazon users to answer questions for other Alexa owners. This program is ultra sensitive with the questions you ask (even if they’re not offensive.)For example, even though Jeffrey Epstein did terrible things, the Alexa program won’t tell you where his island is located. I understand the connection, but I guess everyone Jeffrey Epstein said hello to is also off limits.	3	August 20, 2021	1
344	Echo Dot	Distortion of audio starts at number eight through ten. Need a replacement. Just last week was the first time I set it up and used it.To much bass in the speaker system.Can it be adjusted with software. I not please let me return the dot and get a new replacement.	3	February 15, 2022	1
345	Echo Dot	"Amazon KNOWS people don't live solitary lives, we all have friends, many of us have kids. These devices shouldn't be able to spend real money with a ""YES"" but they can, and though you can change the settings, the reason why they're shipped like that is very clear, they want your accidentally spent money, and morally, that's like bars getting all their money from people with serious life problems. Rethink your strategies if you value your souls."	3	December 25, 2021	1
346	Echo Dot	Satisfecha con Alexa .	2	October 23, 2022	0
347	Echo Dot	It’s a pretty decent speaker for basic demands, ordering, timers, etc… but the sound quality could be a little better, speaker distorts easily with bass. But you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a smart speaker with decent sound quality the Echo 4th gen sounds pretty damn good for it’s size and it truly delivers small to medium room filling sound. I also recommend if you are an Apple Fan the HomePod Mini has pretty good sound quality as well.	3	December 6, 2021	1
348	Echo Dot	"David Josue was my customer service chatbot / person.  I own multiple Echo device including an echo, FIreTV, several dots throughout my house.  They all work great except one of the new 3rd generation Dots recently purchased.  That new Dot drops my music streams around 8-10 times per hour, sometimes more...sometimes every song...and has done it right from the start.So what do I do?  I go online to request an exchange for a new functional Dot.  The system FORCES me to chat or speak on the phone with a customer service rep.  Okay, irritating, especially when I could have simply opted to return the item for a refund, and then buying another new one to accomplish this same task.  But, I'll do it.Over 2 hours later, after chatting with David through this time, I've provided lots of ridiculous info, router make and model, distance from router, other device info, etc., some of which may be relevant, but also including a DNA sample (kidding), and get this - approving his request for an Amazon rep to conduct a house visit to gather debug info from the Dot....?!?!?  Seriously, for a $30 device?!  I say ""sure!"" because at this point, I think they make this process as long and drawn out to dissuade people from getting this done...what else am I to think?  What would you think?So, David concludes by saying this will take several days to have the development team triage my data and get back to me via email about next steps...Meanwhile my device dropped the stream 11 times in a little over an hour while chatting with David.  He wraps our chat session by asking if he has addressed all my concerns and questions.  I tell him, well, ""No, not satisfactorily, but you know that don't you David?""  He responds -""Perfect! Have a great evening.""So now, I'm all in to see how utterly absurd this process will be to exchange the Dot for one that functions properly.  It goes without saying that I will not be recommending Echo devices to anyone and will be regaling them with the request for a home visit by Amazon before honoring the exchange request.  I seriously doubt anyone, including you kind readers, will believe it!  But, it's true.  I swear on my dog's life.So, what will come next??  I don't know but am waiting in awe of this stupidity and will update as it goes....UPDATE:  the second Dot that came in the order with the first one is now also dropping pandora streams, so it'll be a return for both, especially since I've not received the aforementioned email from the development team wanting to swing by the house for a debug and beer session.  I guess I'm done buying Echo devices until they work this out."	1	August 29, 2019	0
349	Echo Dot	I bought this to replace our Alexa echo from 2016.  We love our Alexa echo and use it everyday.  So I wanted an upgrade.  the new one 3rd gen the sound is marbled.  I cannot listen to podcasts or any lyrics on it as its so hard to understand.  the oldest one we have is amazingly clear but its been breaking up a little after 7 years of daily use.	2	July 13, 2022	0
350	Echo Dot	I won an Echo Dot from a local radio station. I am happy I did not go and buy this smart speaker because it does not meet my expectations. You cannot change the base in this speaker. It is far too much bass and not enough treble so  all of the words spoken on a radio station or audio book are muffled. Alexa is very responsive but she tells me I cannot increase the treble.	3	December 15, 2021	1
351	Echo Dot	Negative: Gives you incomplete or false information to encourage you to purchase through Amazon.Example: I needed a lemon to make muffins and asked when the local Walmart opened, Alexa refused to acknowledge the store 3 miles down the road and would only give me stores farther than 100 miles from me. I then asked for the nearest Subway, it listed the Subway that used to be in the local Walmart pre-pandemic. Do not ask Alexa for information, as it will mislead you.Positive: It connects to and controls smart home devices fairly easily, with minor bugs.Example: I can turn on and control some settings on an air conditioner, but it doesn't read the temperature correctly so I can't tell it to increase or decrease based on that. Works great for binary controls though, like light switches.	3	July 31, 2021	1
352	Echo Dot	So I've tested my Echo dot on a few devices and it's perfectly ok if all you need is a cheap Alexa enabled device to play a little music or control your lights.  That's what it's good at.What I didn't anticipate was that the base would be so overpowering that listening to voices on podcasts, the news, or youtube videos would be near impossible.  Imagine everything is down pitched a whole octave.  I didn't have enormously high expectations but a cheap no-name brand speaker does better than this.  Going into settings and cranking the bass all the way down helps a little, but not enough.  That said if the only thing you will do with your speaker is listen to music, you might enjoy the bass-heavy sound.  Just know that using this to listen to people talk or listen to dialogue is probably out of the question.My other critique is that these speakers should really have an audio-in jack instead of audio out, or better yet, both.  If I wanted to have an audio out jack, I'd buy an Alexa Input device for half the price.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  Maybe the regular Echo and Echo Studio are better.	3	June 18, 2020	1
353	Echo Dot	I ordered two echo dots and I was able to connect one with no problem but the second one I could not connect I ended up needed to contact customer service and they couldn’t get it to connect either. They did send me a replacement with no charge as long as I send the broken one back. But the replacement worked great. They do exactly what an echo dot is supposed to do. I have one in my bedroom and one in my living room, both rooms are on different stories so I live that I’m able to connect to each of them to make announcements to the other part of the house.	3	September 28, 2021	1
354	Echo Dot	I bought this product thinking I could sync it with my Alexa devices but truthfully this one and the others I have bought have been a huge let down. Even after you sync them which is a process that could go a lot easier and download the skills the product doesn’t perform properly. You could speak right into the speaker or from any distance really and still have to repeat yourself a lot. Even after repeating yourself it may say that skill, song or book isn’t available even though it’s something the device has already done before. You tell the device to play in a group and it repeats the group and song of choice and still only plays on one speaker or not at all. The funny thing is it can hear really well. I could be in a place with no devices and make a noise and it would hear it and respond. Also it will just randomly blink a different color when nothing is wrong and completely stop responding or not respond at all.	1	August 30, 2022	0

The features and functionality are limited at best, and have hardly advanced at all in those years.At some point, they started a feature where Alexa responds with ""By the way, [...]"" after you give a command that does not warrant a reply, such as ""set a timer"" or ""turn on the light"". These are incredibly intrusive, obnoxious, uncalled for - this is a device, not a human, and it has no place interjecting additional BS when I ask it to perform a simple task.They've taken this one step further recently, however, by turning those ""By the way"" interjections into actual advertisements. I just set a time and my Echo Dot responded with ""By the way, did you know we now have premium timer tones available for purchase? Would you like to purchase one?""You have absolutely no right piping advertisements directly into my home, especially for a product I PAID MONEY FOR. This isn't some freemium app supported by ads. Shame on you Amazon. This is the final straw - I'm ripping these sad, useless devices out and replacing them all with Google Home minis which at least don't try to advertise to me (yet).On another note: I once left a review on an older generation of Amazon Echo, and someone from Amazon literally called me on my mobile phone to ask about the review - but then asked me to provide personal information to confirm it was actually me they were talking to. Are you kidding me? You're going to call me, unsolicited, and then ask me to prove who I am just so you can address a review that I didn't ask to be contacted about? Y'all have seriously misunderstood (or just completely disregarded) the concept of customer experience. What a sad company you've turned into."	1	August 19, 2021	0
360	Echo Dot	device is bulky	3	May 14, 2022	1
361	Echo Dot	Okay, so I prefer Amazon's device over Google's even though it's not as intuitive or useful. You have to hook it to a surround sound system if you don't like crackle and speaker pop. In spite of this, I just hate Google enough that Amazon's products like these are my go to choice.	3	January 28, 2022	1
362	Echo Dot	It's cheap and does its job somewhat, but it's really unreliable. Sometimes voice commands don't work and integrations with things such as smart lights are very finicky. Also severe delays randomly, Alexa will do the task a few seconds after you give the command. Wouldn't recommend for any important tasks.	3	January 31, 2022	1
363	Echo Dot	there should be a way to easily manage the devices connected to alexa if i replace a tv in my house alexa should be able to forget the old one etc and also if someone is told by your customer service that they will call you back with a solution they should call you back.	3	January 25, 2022	1
364	Echo Dot	Volume seems to increase when ads interrupt music.  Kind of irritating.	3	May 1, 2022	1
365	Echo Dot	The sound from Alexa is very muffled and hard to understand most of the time.  Tried adjusting but nothing seems to work.  Except for this I'm very happy with what it can do.  Now if you can only tell me how to adjust the sound, I would appreciate it very much.	3	January 22, 2022	1
366	Echo Dot	I was surprised to find Alexa asking me to subscribe to Amazon music (~$15/month) after a few random free  songs. This is so unbecoming of the product.	3	April 8, 2022	1
367	Echo Dot	Other than the aesthetic appeal, this generation is trash compared to the original.  I hadn't upgraded because I didn't think I needed to.  Now I feel like my suspicions have been confirmed.	2	August 29, 2022	0
368	Echo Dot	El sonido es MUY malo y no es tan inteligente	3	May 3, 2022	1
369	Echo Dot	Got a new wifi router the Eerro 6. I setup my wifi with the same name and password all my other devices can automatically connect except my echo that’s beyond unacceptable. I shouldn’t have to reconnect it to wifi when nothing changed and all my other smart devices automatically connected to my new router.Because of that I won’t be switching my google homes to Alexa.	2	July 13, 2022	0
370	Echo Dot	Set it  up. Great. Gave commands. Great. Within a few hours, my digital pad on my GE stove and my Whirlpool dryer were going nuts!!! I did not download any of these appliance apps. So, I unplugged the DOT and in a few hours, I had my stove and dryer back to normal. Few days later, tried again and it did the same thing to the appliances. Unplugged. Also flipped the main breakers. Waited a few days, then plugged the DOT into a different outlet on a different breaker. Within 24 hours, my TV had viewing issues on some of the channels. Wobbly lines. This lasted for several hours. Unplugged the TV cable and replugged. No luck.  Finally unplugged the DOT. So. Dot is in my closet. I am going to try one more time and reset to factory and try to start the process over again. If it is affecting certain appliances in the house, then I cannot use it. Super disappointed and don't know how to fix.	2	January 11, 2022	0
371	Echo Dot	One thing that I would suggest is that it is a wireless device not to be plugged in all the time. Seems kind of useless to be located in one particular spot all the time. Low level music and voice are muffled and not very clear	3	February 4, 2022	1
372	Echo Dot	I previously ordered the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa and it worked out great. It is easy to set up and connects to other devices that are Alexa compatible. I decided to buy a battery base for the Echo dot to make it more portable around the house. That's when I found out that the AUX device pin receptacle was misaligned which prevents the device cable to attach properly. I returned it via UPS as per Amazon Customer Service instruction (which cost me $5 at UPS since I threw away the packaging required to send it back), and I had it replaced with another Echo Dot. I just received it and this one has the same defect. I wonder if Amazon is aware of this quality control issue happening with this product!? This defect will not allow for any AUX device to be attached as an AUX speaker or battery base.	3	June 12, 2021	1
373	Echo Dot	In a world where we literally choose which conglomerate we allow to spy on us, Alexa is the Amazon option.  Trading our privacy for small conveniences.BTW, I did not buy this, it came with a purchase and my son thinks it's cool not having to flip a light switch.	3	January 27, 2022	1
374	Echo Dot	"This one replaced another Echo Dot (3rd Gen) because the speaker had gone bad after about 3 years.  The new one has a ""tinny"" speaker out of the box.  The primary location of this Dot is by our exercise equipment.  Our primary use for this unit is to listen to music while we work out."	3	January 9, 2022	1
375	Echo Dot	In general, the third generation Echo Dot functions as well previous generations, but it makes Alexa sound like she's talking through a pillow. Bizarre! The 3rd Gen Dot may have improved a tad in the quality of music playback; not enough to prevent listening fatigue from setting in very quickly, though. The contours of the new generation are more pleasant to look at. That said, does anyone buy a Dot to look at it?	3	December 10, 2021	1
376	Echo Dot	Update: Returned.I frequenly interact with my Echo devices, but it's not so easy with the 3rd generation Dot. It is hard for me to understand what Alexa is saying. I tried to adjust the audio, but nothing I tried changed that problem. However, the Dot's audio is fine for listening to the news and music. That, rather than Alexa's voice, comes through clearly.I bought the 3rd gen Dot because many reviews for the 4th generation say it isn't an upgrade from the 3rd, and some say the 4th gen is inferior. I had hoped the Dot would improve on the Echo Flex I was using (it often ignored comands and another device would answer even though the other device was rooms away from where I was and the Flex is just a few feet from me. But Alexa's voice on the Flex was far superior to what it is on the new Dot. I'm not sure I'll keep the Dot. I may fish the Flex out of the trash.	2	January 3, 2022	0
377	Echo Dot	"I have other voice assistants and do not mind them. The echo dot is good for the most part. It has higher quality sound than some other comparable assistants out there. Seems to hear me for the most part when I am talking to it. My biggest complaint though and something that gets more annoying with time is how intrusive Alexa is. Alexa constantly makes suggestions to me about how I can set modes and automatic weather or traffic updates. I even turned off settings to stop this and I see no changes. When I ask Alexa to turn on a light I do not need it to then blab on about what else Alexa can do. Its honestly annoying as can be. I want to say ""turn on a light"" and she turns on a light nothing else. Or tell me the weather and she tells me the weather. Rather I find that after the short answer to what I asked Alexa to do I get a long drawn out explanation of what else it can do. If this happened once that would be fine but I find that for years after using the echo dot I still get the same explanations over and over. It honestly makes me want to toss the thing in the garbage."	1	June 3, 2022	0
378	Echo Dot	I have both Google minis and the Echo dot in my home and the Echo sound is very muffled.  Everything else about it is fine but I just can't get past the poor sound quality and don't think I'd ever buy another.	3	February 13, 2022	1
379	Echo Dot	Works like any other hockey buck Alexa. But sound is super muffled when listening to music or kindle books. And that is what I use this the most for. That is all.	3	March 9, 2022	1
380	Echo Dot	"My husband got the Echo ""free"" with an order, and it sat in the box, unused, for a very long time.  So, I thought I would check it out and try it - bad idea!  Sure, I could ask for the weather (not that impressive, really), but when I asked for a certain song to play, ""Alexa"" offered the unlimited music subscription for 14.99/month.  ""NO!""  I said.  Well, my 6-year-old twins were excited to hear the Echo play ""Baby Shark,"" and when I wasn't in the room, they asked for a song and agreed to the music subscription without my knowing!  WHAT?!  Then, despite trying to cancel TWICE, I see a charge in my bank account, resulting in me having to cancel my debit card and file a dispute claim.  Such a hassle and headache.  All because I turned on this stupid speaker for ONE day.  Total rip-off.  Bad idea"	1	September 5, 2022	0
381	Echo Dot	I have 2 other Echo Dots. I purchased this 3rd one to take in my RV.It is not near as good as my other two. She doesn't answer like she should when asked a question  I know is easy for her.Very disappointed.	3	February 8, 2022	1
382	Echo Dot	When I got the echo dot it was working okay. Didn't always understand everything but I've only had it for less than two weeks and it cuts out and sounds like its skipping on songs and when things are talking. No clue why. I like that it can know whose talking but you need to add in understand children better.	3	January 3, 2022	1
383	Echo Dot	"I already owned one of the new Alexa's and love the sound and ease-of-use...so did my son, so he kidnapped her from my kitchen to his room!  I bought the Echo Dot because the price was right and thought since it came with the Alexa feature, it would sound just as good.  Unfortunately, while the Dot does still have the same ease-of-use as the larger Alexa, the quality of sound doesn't compare.  The larger Alexa seems to have a more clear quality with music, even when asking her to increase the bass.  I tried the same with the Dot and it does increase the bass, but it becomes a little raspy, like a cheap set of car speakers.I have to admit, I really don't use the Dot or Alexa for anything but to listen to music when I'm downstairs, so, I can't attest to the rest of it's features.  I can say, if you're looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use device, the Echo Dot will suffice.  However, if you don't mind spending a little more to be able to enjoy a better quality sound, the larger Alexa model is definitely the better choice.  In fact, since my son only listens to ""talk radio"", I'm going to switch the devices while he's in school...he'll never know the difference!  HaHa"	3	December 20, 2019	1
384	Echo Dot	First let me say I love my dot and Alexa! However my dot is not working as it should and I had to take it offline until I can afford to replace it.And replace it I will what's not to like about Alexa I talk with her everyday.	3	February 7, 2022	1
385	Echo Dot	I bought it for the supposed better sound quality, But I am disappointed. Music sounds good on it, but Alexa's voice is very muffled and difficult to understand. I'm very disappointed that Amazon would put this on the market without correcting the issue.	3	February 13, 2022	1
386	Echo Dot	Alexa is still great for a lot things if I am inputting a shopping list, for example. But if I want to know the weather or play music, this 3rd gen Echo is a disappointment. It's sometimes staticy and sometimes lives up to its name ... it echoes or sounds as if it is underwater.I still have one of my 1st gens and its sound quality is much, much better than this.	3	December 4, 2021	1
387	Echo Dot	Not something I would ever buy, gifted to us. Set up and used about a week. I don't need or want constant background music. I don't need her to answer my questions. I can time things for myself. I haven't found a good use for her.	3	February 1, 2022	1
388	Echo Dot	First time buying a product like this, I'm glad I invested the money into a deal I had found online versus pay the original price. In my opinion, I don't think I would have purchased this for the amount it actually costs, I don't think it's worth it.Overall, it's a decent product. The biggest downfall- IT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT WIFI OR WITHOUT THE DEVICE BEING PLUGGED IN!! Regardless of those MAJOR problems...The Alexa integration is not bad, it does for the most part respond to what you ask and it does entertain all age groups. The timer and reminder settings on the echo dot are extremely convenient. I also love that this is a Bluetooth speaker as well but majorly disappointed in the sound quality!! You do get what you pay for though and this product is not big on size to produce an extreme amount of sound. Again, it could be better but I'm still very glad I have it.I honestly purchased this for the Bluetooth speaker so there are other functions and capabilities I'm sure I'm not aware of that make this product better by chance so take that into consideration if you do decide to buy.	3	June 12, 2020	1
389	Echo Dot	So we have 3 of these. For some reason, when I call my daughters Alexa, it will make both my daughters and my sons ring. If my son is calling mine, it says its my daughter. Other than that it works great!	3	February 4, 2022	1
390	Echo Dot	Every other commercial says “just say Alexa add (so-and-so) to my cart”.. Well guess who hears her name, then replied?  ALEXA!  Unplugged it and only plug in if I want to listen to Amazon music (& my phones dead)!And there’s one you WONT see reviews for: Amazon Music (esp. unlimited!)They must’ve NOT wanted to get negative feedback about people being billed for a service that Amazon asks “would you like a reminder when the service is about to end?” And they never GIVE said notice (but they DO give you a BILL)! 👎	3	October 17, 2021	1
391	Echo Dot	After hooking up the Echo Dot I realized that the power cord did not work.	2	September 22, 2022	0
392	Echo Dot	I really like Alexa; it beats the Google Assistant in a lot of ways (not all though) but I will focus on the actual Echo Dot in this review. The speaker has four microphones on it and they pick up voices amazingly well. The speaker looks nice and I really like the buttons on top that make controlling it even easier. I also think that the speaker (actually 3 speakers within) has the potential to sound pretty good. But, there are some issues that really keep me from enjoying this. First: the sound tuning just seems off. It is really bass heavy which would normally be great but since the speaker is so small it just makes everything else sound less pronounced and muddy. Second: the sound randomly becomes distorted sometimes, especially when playing on a Bluetooth speaker. I’m not talking about a little white noise, I mean it sounds like you’re losing signal to a radio station; it cuts in and out. Amazon knows about that issue but they haven’t pushed out an update to fix it as of Feb 2020. So, because of these sound issues, I can’t really recommend getting an Echo Dot 3rd Gen. The new Google Nest Mini, though less bassy, sounds astonishingly better and what good is a speaker if it sounds bad?	3	February 5, 2020	1
393	Echo Dot	It was a gift which i appreciated but I discovered this isn't the echo with Time on front......which makes me think why didn't they make them all with a standard time on the front with all of them....it just makes sense to me - but i'll probably place it somewhere as a speaker for music -	3	January 13, 2022	1
394	Echo Dot	This came with a smart bulb which was a good value but I could not get the smart bulb to work with Alexa so I had to unpair them and uninstall the Alexa app and start over from scratch. Needless to say the smart bulb is now sitting on the counter and she is working fine now.	3	January 9, 2022	1
395	Echo Dot	I replaced an old Echo Dot Gen 2 hoping for improvements.  Yes, it's much louder.  This was my first goal.  However, most of the increased volume is in the BASS region.  Music sounds excellent, but it ruins the clarity of the speech from the IHeart Radio stations, etc.  I tried to adjust the frequency response in the APP but it has very little affect.  I have 6 other models of various types and ages.  They all sound excellent.	3	November 6, 2021	1
396	Echo Dot	I’ve had an Amazon echo for several years now, my home is almost fully automated and just recently alexa just started to crap out. 1. She can’t control the lights in the house anymore, she can run her programming but I can’t tell her “kitchen lights 100%” she acts like the lights aren’t set up 2. She stopped playing music on Pandora because they are trying to get you to subscribe to Amazon Music 3. If she actually plays what I ask her to she plays it on the wrong echo, I’ll ask for a song in to play in the living room and she’ll play it in the nursery. I don’t need Megan Thee Stallion blasting in my kids room while he’s trying to take nap. And if I’m specific and say play a song on Living Room Echo she tells me it doesn’t exist half the the time and the other half of the time it’ll work 4. She always mishears me but that’s been since day one, I put up with it because every thing else worked. I’m going to sell my 7 echos and make the switch to Google Home	1	July 8, 2022	0
397	Echo Dot	Voice is clear, I used for wake ups, weather and other information	3	April 23, 2022	1
398	Echo Dot	So we bought this for our retail store, unfortunately, we have to keep telling ALEXA , put on 100.5 , numerous times a day . She just shuts off , mid song ??? Not sure why ??	3	February 22, 2022	1
399	Echo Dot	"I received this as a Christmas gift. I use my Computer, iPad and Android when seeking information. The sound isn't as clear as Siri. I am concerned because it turns on without anyone saying ""Alexa"". Probably paranoid but I feel someone is listening to our conversation as many have suggested."	3	January 20, 2022	1
400	Echo Dot	I purchased this product to replace the old alexa. This little machine likes to turn on the lights in the middle of the night when your asleep. It has done it several times. I will troubleshoot and if it continues it goes back.	3	January 27, 2022	1
401	Echo Dot	So this little machine is a very good buy but I don’t like how I need to pay to hear music and play games. Like I wanted it for music but I don’t wanna pay. So now I just use it for Bluetooth! Umm it’s ver convenient! Just those pricey add on’s. Would I recommend?? Nah not really cause I basically use it as a radio so it’s really whatever.	2	July 3, 2022	0
402	Echo Dot	"The device is great, it hears your voice and responds promptly, the volume is more than high enough, the design is nice. However, a few problems gave me a bad taste overall. The device has an AUX input but completely lacks the feature to be used as an AUX speaker (the AUX input is essentially functionally useless). Another issue involves the ""skills"" that Alexa has, one such being the Spotify ""skill"" that allows you to play music on command. The issue arises any time I ask Alexa to play a song or playlist, it doesn't play the song or playlist that I asked but rather some random playlist called ""[name of song] radio,"" which proceeds to play random music."	3	August 12, 2021	1
403	Echo Dot	This speaker has good sound quality and is fun to use when you get it set up but you almost need a degree in computer engineering to get it set up.  They need to simplify the setup process.	3	February 11, 2022	1
404	Echo Dot	I have purchased 3 over time and haven given one as a gift, and have learn to know that the speaker becomes muffled over time,	3	March 30, 2022	1
405	Echo Dot	Alexa does not play nice with YouTube Music. This was a deal breaker for me because that is my preferred music app. I switched to Google nest immediately because playing music from my existing playlists was one of my main reasons of getting a smart speaker.	3	January 23, 2022	1
406	Echo Dot	It's ok but the thing I noticed different from also having the 2nd gen, is that it takes longer to respond to you and sometimes it don't at all, so that's why I only give it 3 stars. I like the look of gen 3 better but I actually prefer the gen 2 over this one because of it's quick response and it can hear you better from far off. I almost thought about just returning the 2 new dots that I have but since they no longer have gen 2 available, I'll just hang onto them. Thought about trading in the older dot for new when I was buying the new dots, now I'm glad I didn't!( I'm not for sure if the 3rd gen echo dot is worst or it's my hotspot, being that I just found out that I'm maxed out on my hotspot. I have the new google nest mini and google nest hub now also and I'm having the same problems with it not working as well sometimes, no response at times.  It could be that this dot works just fine if you are using it with a good internet setup. So I really can't say for sure it's not as good, this has just been what I'm experiencing with this dot.)	3	December 26, 2019	1
407	Echo Dot	"PLEASE come up with a way for the machine to physically answer you when you call out the Wake word WITH A VERBAL RESPONSE, example good evening user name here HOW MAY I ASSIST  as I am getting sick and tired of having to repeat myself time after time when the machine either does not hear me and or does not answer me when I Do infact speak to it to it plus if these machines are supposed to be ""smart speakers"" why can't they answer questions without responding with ""I don't know that one"" which happens 80% of the time? Furthermore in regards to not being heard that shouldn't happen at all considering I have multiple speakers in my home so there is no reason for the system to not HEAR anyone. in regards to answers to questions it's like the only thing it searches for is the Amazon database & if the desired question & answer is not in the Amazon database it has no clue. I'm seriously thinking about replacing all of my speakers in my house with the Google home equivalent I've been using Google products since Android froyo came out and Google has NEVER ONCE told me it does not know the answer to something. Because I can ask Alexa the same question I ask Google back to back and majority of the time Alexa says she doesn't know the answer whereas  Google gives me the answer immediately something's wrong with that picture &  for god sakes the most important Part is I don't have to repeat myself to Google.I apologize but I'm really irritated with the echo experience and borderline regret the purchase."	1	November 23, 2021	0
408	Echo Dot	"Alexa has a hard time understanding the names of foreign artists - specifically Korean - as she doesn't listen all the way to the command. Even when I type it into the Alexa app, she somehow gets it incorrect. Also, when I ask for a certain song due to me not having Amazon Music and I use Apple Music she will reply with ""To play specific songs you must have Amazon Music"" or with something very similar. She will say she can't find a specific song on Apple Music when I know for sure the song is there because most of the time I'm..looking at it on Apple Music on my laptop.It is frustrating to have to either type in the song I want Alexa to play or have to repeat myself multiple times for her to understand. If she could understand names, and not default them to ""American"" or ""English speaking"" artists the echo would get a 5/5. Until that is fixed...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who doesn't listen to traditionally American/mainstream artists."	3	December 20, 2020	1
409	Echo Dot	Got it on sale. Never interacted with one till my daughter-in-law used it at Thanksgiving for keeping track of when to make what for dinner and music. I thought it was pretty cool. I still think it's cool tho I don't really need it, just another gadget. I do all those things on my phone.	3	January 3, 2022	1
410	Echo Dot	Even after downloading downloading Alexa app, she still has no idea where I live. Even with a full address, she can't find Grand Marais, MN! Junk Echo or junk app? Who knows, because they can't talk to each other.	3	January 29, 2022	1
411	Echo Dot	So I received this as part of a promotion. I had to sign up for amazon music and then received this for $1. I was initially very excited just to have a decent, somewhat portable speaker. Unfortunately there was a bit of a rattle coming from the speaker as soon as I set it up. At first this didn't bother me too much but it got progressively worse over the next couple weeks. Now it sounds like a blown speaker. I've never even come close to turning this up loud so I know it's not my fault. Would love to get a replacement but am not being offered one, likely because it was part of a promotion. I just think that if they're only going to offer the $1 back, then they should also refund the amount paid for amazon music, seeing as getting the echo for $1 was the only reason I signed up for it.	2	January 20, 2022	0
412	Echo Dot	Spotify does not work very well! When you have more than one device it gets kind of slow… it keeps saying: this command is not supported right now!	3	March 12, 2022	1
413	Echo Dot	"I got this as a gift to use in my workroom basically just as a radio because it has a ""FREE"" listening option.  I have no desire for yet another bill every month so I figured it'd be okay and save space. I thought the free version would just have normal commercials and adds but the music would be fine. Well the ""FREE"" listening option without signing up and paying every month is a joke. No matter what style of music you choose to listen to it only shuffles through 15 to 20 songs from each style you choose. It plays the same handful of songs over and over. At least half of these songs are lesser known or lesser wanted versions like the Whitesnake ""hobo"" version of ""Here I go Again"" if you ask to hear 80's hair metal for example. The volume of each song is different as well. Some are a lot louder than others and you have to keep adjusting the volume as you listen if you want it all the same. The speaker strength is nothing to brag about either even for such a small device.  Also, the music styles you chose will sometimes be contaminated with songs from other styles. Adding insult to injury Amazon sticks their own spoken adds in among the terrible selection of ""FREE"" music you get telling you to join up for better options. And yes, I know this thing is supposed to be used for and with other stuff and I'm assuming if you pay every month it'd be a million times better. I'm just giving my opinion on what I wanted it for. If you don't sign up for the paid version you're basically getting a 45-minute commercial that repeats. So, if you just want to listen to something for free as a radio with no hassle and no extra bill every month...just buy a radio."	2	February 10, 2020	0

418	Echo Dot	"I am a tech geek.I have been a proponent of the benefits of the technological innovations since the late 1990's, and I don't mind dropping a dime on things I am generally interested in, or something I see genuine benefit from, which I why I purchased 2 Alexa Dots.No one suggested: ""Oh by the way... an Echo Dot would be nice"", or ""Did you know..."", to try to compel me into purchasing something I didn't want or need.Before buying the dots, I was tentative and went back and forth between this and Google's product. But someone gifted us Facebook's Portal, which embedded Alexa by default, and we liked how Alexa integrated our IoT devices perfectly. So after noticing that general conversations turned into FB ads, we replaced the portal with our 2nd Dot.Not long after, the 'Oh, by the ways' started creeping in, prompting me to extensively investigate how to turn these unwarranted invasions prompts off. Towards the end of summer, every other 'Alexa' request/engagement became an unwarranted invasion of thought, focus, activity.  The last time I used ""the Dot"" was after I needed an '11 minute timer for pasta', while preparing a family meal, only to be nudged by some inane BS, this multi-billion dollar corporation NEEDED for me to purchase.Really?If I really wanted whatever the Amazon algorithms presumed would be a good thing for me at that most inopportune time, I would research it, and purchase it myself without a DAMN prompt!Purchasing anything related to Alexa or the Echo Dot, is like paying a telemarketer to call you just because you want the benefit of your telephone."	1	December 20, 2021	0
419	Echo Dot	Sound: The sounds is alright. For a cheap-ish bluetooth speaker it isn’t too bad, but depending on how you use you will find some limitations. Sonically no one will be blown away, but it functions.Connectivity: This has been a nightmare. I have two of these. They will randomly show the blue and orange lights, go back into setup modes, turn on Alexa from disabled and require completely removing the pairing and starting over. Super frustrating and both units do it. Bluetooth seems pretty good, but can delay at times. I have yet to have any luck with the aux cable, though... on either of them.Alexa: It can hear me and most of the time understands very basic stuff. It doesn’t integrate with a lot of stuff I use, so it severely limits functionality.Compatibility: No Google support sucks. I have hoping to use the speakers in a right and left config as they had been setup, but you are limited in that regard. Play Music not having native support sucks, but I can just connect to bluetooth. It would great to have the wizardry available outside of some weird backend stuff that Amazon is doing on their servers.Summary: If you get this free or for a dollar or something, awesome. 100% no-go at full price. If you have invested in another ecosystem, make sure to verify full compatibility, even at half off. You can pickup wireless speakers for around the same price that are better, but lack Alexa. If Alexa is what you desperately want, then this is totally for you.	2	August 12, 2020	0
420	Echo Dot	"Alexa Echo Dot is great when it works.  Mine stopped working.  After several times on the phone with the ""help"" Alexa was still broken.  They told me to try several things.  When that didn't work I was told to wait a few days and call back if it still does not work.  When called back they went through the same steps that didn't work the first time.  I gave up and bought another one.  Alexa is great as long as you don't have any problems with it."	3	September 24, 2021	1
421	Echo Dot	"10/25/2020: For the last two days all Echo says is I'm having trouble connecting. Everything else works and connects fine. They will have to go back. I'll go back to using my previous gens. They say it from time to time but at least when they do I don't feel bad about wasting my money. I was sure the wifi would be more robust in this model but I was wrong.10/23/2020: Just as I suspected, the music was tailored to make me want to try Amazon Music. It was nice, but no go. I have a huge music library that I can play for free any time I like. I'm chronically ill so I'm rarely in a music or dancing mood. Covid has only made my life harder than it was, like it has for everyone. I do really like the device so I upped my rating to 4-stars and won't be needing the new gen that is getting really poor reviews. Saved some money there that I will use for mounting solutions and a skin or two at some point. Everyone please stay safe and well!10/22/2020: Reset the Echo and it still couldn't play my audiobook. Tried each of the other two Echos and neither of them would play it either. Something's up, but honestly, this is way at the bottom of my list. I figure it will work itself out later. The reason I upped it to 3-stars is that when I asked for music, something I never do because I don't want to trigger ads, Echo hit a home-run with each and every one on each device. Perfect music for me that made me cry. Amazon knows me way too well. Keeping all three, non-playing audiobooks be damned.Original: I don't ask much of my device, the weather (on occasion), sunset / sunrise time, lights on and off. My first test echo failed. Asked to play audiobook and she told me four times ""playing, how long was left, etc."", but never made a sound. Total and complete waste of my time."	1	October 19, 2020	0
422	Echo Dot	"I like it, but wish it was less responsive if at all to other voices.  I'll be watching tv, and a commercial will say ""Hey Alexa,"" and it responds.  Otherwise I enjoy the product."	3	February 7, 2022	1
423	Echo Dot	First, I did adjust the Audio settings in the Alexa app (this is my 3rd echo) but no matter what it's so much bass & reverb, I don't use it as much.  Even when using as a Bluetooth speaker, I have to adjust the equalizer of the streaming device.  This echo must have been missed with QC, unable to return or exchange - this is will be the last echo I'll purchase	3	November 7, 2021	1
424	Echo Dot	Amazon changed their previous Alexa from not recognizing text with cussing to a new design that will respond to cussing as wellu.

426	Echo Dot	A veces no me identifica si no le hablo fuerte pero nada del otro	3	April 13, 2022	1
427	Echo Dot	So far I've mostly only used my Alexa for listening to Spotify, so I am not sure of her full potential, however I do see areas that could be improved. For example, if I ask her a question while the music is playing, she won't pause the music to answer the question but instead talks over the music which I find a bit annoying. Since they do favor towards Amazon music, I am unable to ask her to like songs or add songs to playlists on my Spotify account. Another thing I noticed is that I will ask her a question and she will not answer or won't give me the results when asked to read my notifications. I also wish the device was wireless so I could take it around the house without needing an outlet. Aside from these issues listed above, I have enjoyed using my Echo.	3	May 29, 2021	1
428	Echo Dot	"I've had this for 2wks, now. It worked like a dream fresh out of the box. However, it seems like the longer I have it the more problems I have. The voice recognition is hit or miss.  If I wanted to be ignored every other time when I called it's name, I'd talk to my kids. At first I thought it may be a noise issue. (Too much stuff going on in the background.) Unfortunately, it will do the same thing when it's dead silent. Other occasions, it will recognize that I've said ""Echo"" but will not complete the demand.  For example, I'll say ""Echo,"" it lights up and it lights up. I say ""Set alarm for 0430"" almost immediately after and it's a coin toss as to if it will actually do anything.  It also tends to sporadically stop playing Amazon Music. I haven't had any problems with that when playing the local stations. I've checked the connection when it acts up and WiFi seems to be 100%, so I don't believe any of this is simply a connection issue.  I'm not sure if this is a regular thing, but it also tends to ""ding"" randomly.  Like it's reconnecting or something, but there wasn't anything wrong with the connection that I've seen."	3	December 3, 2019	1
429	Echo Dot	She can't seem to understand that when I say Play Spotify Playlist (whatever) she plays (whatever) radio. Tried googling for the fix, but none of the advice has helped. Other than that, really enjoy it and want another one for a different part of my home.	3	January 3, 2022	1
430	Echo Dot	what do you think about it A thief came to the house today. From the video, he saw that the thief didn't break in. He only said to open the door to the Alexa speaker at the door, and then the door opened.	3	January 10, 2022	1

433	Echo Dot	Bought 3 for my small house. Doesn’t pick up voice and have to literally scream in bedroom and dinning room. In basement doesn’t always pick up. Also doesn’t get as loud as I would like when playing music, connected to my sound bar and still low. Considering buying 2 more. Doesn’t make sense.	3	December 25, 2021	1
434	Echo Dot	These refurbs are very bassy in tone hard to hear spoken word even with eq adjustment on Alexa.	3	April 1, 2022	1
435	Echo Dot	I’m extremely unhappy with Amazon. I’ve been a very loyal Prime member for a very long time and the fact that you aren’t honoring your offer is aggravating,maddening and saddening and now has me questioning why I pay for Prime benefits. I was offered, without asking, a refund and told I could keep the device if it was ever to arrive. Obviously I chose to to do this. Well my echo finally arrived but it has been deactivated and I’m unable to use it. Let me state; I understand the security issues as these devices are attached to our accounts and appreciate that Amazon takes a proactive stance here however now my device is now nothing more than a paperweight. I contacted Amazon and have been told that I will need to repay for the device or they will not release the lock on it. So then the offer I received has not been upheld and I’m forced to either pay for it or have a useless piece of plastic and metal that will be sitting in a dump decomposing long after all of us are gone. Very disappointing.  Why offer something that you don’t plan to honor!!??  In the past I’ve had issues with orders and deliveries as I order, quite literally, everything from Amazon and they are typically resolved to my satisfaction or at least in a matter that makes sense however this time you really dropped the ball, Amazon.	2	January 10, 2021	0
436	Echo Dot	Excellent for about 20 bucks. great sound. Got this and placed one in garage and one in the bathroom. love having music in garage and the bathroom. Wont pay 40 or 50 for this but 20 is a perfect price.	3	January 21, 2022	1
437	Echo Dot	"I have a gen 1, and the voice that comes out is crisp and clear.I bought another gen 3 and it's louder, and has more bass.Problem is, that when you want voice interaction, it's so basie, it's muddled.Music is much better for sure, but you use and receive voice more than listening to music.Personally I didn't need ""louder"" so much, and voice tone was fine for me.And lately it has problems answering the wake word. By the 3rd request I find myself shouting at it to WAKE UP. Sometimes it just wont respond. It won't wake up when it's playing to ask it to stop and powering down is the only way to abort it's current actions.Often, a light ring appears at the wake word, then quickly goes out , even with repeated requests.These are server problems and that should be noted, but since Amazon has no feedback links this is where I complain.This gen is junk in my opinion. Expensive junk.Now 4-8-20 A growing list of gen 3 problems. It has been a recurring problem for Alexa to light up on the wake word but the command is not followed and the light just goes out. Over & over. It just has response problems.Now I asked it to play something from Amazon music and it says its playing, but no audio comes out. Over & over. I cancelled my music subscription because no one is answering their CS line. But I wondered if it would be the same on my gen 1 and lo and behold it played. It's pretty plain (to me anyway) that gen 3 is a lemon. Oh and about the gen 3? I powered it down and it played just fine.Amazon, you can take your gen3's and throw them in the lake. It's just an annoying piece of electronics."	2	January 4, 2020	0
438	Echo Dot	"I ordered many items to set my 'smart home' up, which included several different echo's. Apart from missing some commands now and then, their functionality overall is decent. But Amazon has really dropped the ball on how it handles music, and trying to get it resolved has been the worst customer service issue we've ever ran into with Amazon. If you're wanting music, and you are single, go for it. If you're not single, here's what you could be in for- my wife had prime for years. But when it comes to buying, setting up, and using technology, that's my area. Well, as it turns out, you can NOT do that and have music work. Because I don't pay for a second prime account (why would I? She's the shoppaholic) all of our devices will not allow us to prime music, because they are 'mine'. Amazon customer service has been useless getting this resolved. This leaves us with two options- cancelling her account and changing everything she uses, is signed into, all of the stored credit card info, losing whatever benefits she has, resetting tv app etc. because it will no longer work. Or we (I) need go through and setup all of the devices all over again under account, which who knows what issues I would have tying them back into the security system, cameras, thermostat, light switches, outlets, door locks, and whatever else we have. They're literally in the same house, at the same address, with our same names as everything else. But how horrible it would be for Amazon to let us use these -speakers- with the music that we pay for. If I had it to do over again I would have went with the ""other brand"" smart home devices instead. I will not be adding any other Amazon devices going forward."	2	February 10, 2020	0
439	Echo Dot	Microphone sensitivity is much improved over 2nd gen, but the output quality of the audio is overly muffled and muddy. Only gets worse at higher volumes. Adjusting in the Alexa app had virtually no effect.	3	February 4, 2022	1
440	Echo Dot	"Not responsive is the biggest issue. For example, asking it to ""snooze"" or ""lower volume or a higher volume"".I can stand within 4 feet in front of it and it doesn't listen.Love the quality of sound for music, but need it to respond."	3	January 7, 2022	1
441	Echo Dot	It's not a bad device, but the integration with Amazon's already lackluster music program is terrible.	2	September 10, 2022	0
442	Echo Dot	Horrible integration with their own Amazon music (unlimited subscription) app which can't cast to the device. Thought of using the cast feature because the bad recognition system doesn't understand what I'm trying to make it play in the first place. Alexa app is another level of stupidity. It has a play tab but you can't search from there and even can't play anything at times as it keeps crashing. Ridiculously buggy piece of software. Hardware is fine.	1	October 20, 2022	0
443	Echo Dot	"Good solid construction, heavy (in a good way) everything we have come to love by Alexia, but one big but the sound of Alexia voice is terrible. I am hard to offend but the sound is SO MUFFLED, it is to the point of distraction. What on the lovely green Earth were they thinking? I gave it one star only for the fact that it does work, but the sound is worse than bad, it is Terrible. It sounds like it is under a pillow. If you are thinking that it is not too much different than say, the first generation, you would be wrong. There is a case of back sliding here, I cannot understand why, I have a second one coming, ( I got it on a free promotion and it will sit on my shelf) I have a 1 generation show, several 1 generation Echo Dots and even though they might be considered ""old"" the sound is better than what I expected. I would send this back if I could."	3	November 21, 2020	1
444	Echo Dot	"The thing I dislike was that Alexa can't turn off my TV even though I made the command Alexa says ""I can't see what the brand for TV"	3	February 21, 2022	1
445	Echo Dot	Cheap tinny sound makes listening to music an awful experience.  Luckily, the Echo Dot has an audio jack, which I used to plug into my Bose computer speakers for amazing sound.  If you have Apple Music, Alexa doesn't fully understand Apple Music such as playlists you have created.  It defaults to an artist's essentials playlist every time.  I shouldn't complaint too much since I got my Echo Dot for a penny with 1 month of Amazon Music, which I cancelled right away.  Apple Music is so much better.  Bottomline, I wouldn't pay full price for an Echo Dot.	2	April 29, 2022	0
446	Echo Dot	"I received this as a free promo via SiriusXM. I was unsure about the alexa due to some things I have heard about it. The first couple weeks I had it I enjoyed it. Especially as I painted my room I could play music and change it up when needed. About three weeks after having it I muted the voice recognition because it would randomly tell me things or ask questions to my conversations.Then about 3 days later around 130 am I was in a deep sleep. All the sudden I was awaken too loud music. I jumped up turned it off, looked and voice recognition was still off. So i just figured it was a ""bug"". Went back to sleep and some time later it did it again. I unplugged it and has been unplugged since, unless I need music for cleaning etc.Maybe I just have not taken the time to get to know how to use it, but I also feel as though its not something i would really get into."	3	October 21, 2020	1
447	Echo Dot	Titled randomness as I would ask alexa to example play some music on spotify and alexa would start telling me todays news as I get confused and a tad irritated it managed to work after awhile..	3	February 1, 2022	1
448	Echo Dot	Ok. So, I rarely write negative reviews. But I'm so shocked by how bad all of my 3 Alexa's are functioning that I have to leave feedback.First of all, expect at least half of the functions not to be working. Even the easiest things like changing the wifi on your Alexa. Or Alexa recognizing devices. My devices are all about 3 months old and since the beginning, everything was a fight. Connecting lamps was a fight. Using spotify is a fight (she chooses the wrong songs all the time, even if the song is super popular).And Fire Tv has been the worst so far. I got a Fire Tv stick just so I could use voice control for Netflix or Prime. But from the very start Alexa only searched for movies but never played them. Costumer service could not help I had just had to accept. If you want to increase or decrease volume, she suddenly mutes the tv all together. Lately she hasn't done anything for fire tv at all.I got all 3 Alexa echo dots at the same time, thinking they would work. One of them I gave to my father. The app is supposed to work on Android 5.0 or higher. Of course the app did not work on his Android 5.01 phone. After hours of trying to fix it, I connected it to my own phone which is actually not a good idea but I had no choice. Anyway, of course connecting smart lamps (philips hue) took ages too.In the end I have to say the amount of time I struggled with Alexa overweighs the time she was of use. I just tried to connect my Alexa to a new wifi and guess what? Even this easy function does not work because Amazon makes everything to complicated and wants Alexa to connect to my phone's wifi, and not directly to the wifi itself.Facepalm. Overall I'm really disappointed, Amazon. By the way, if you use Alexa to send messages, expect her to cut you off at random so you have to repeat the whole message again.The amount of rage trying to make it work is insane. And despite what you might be thinking, I'm not actually the rage kind of person. But this is just ridiculous.	1	March 20, 2020	0
449	Echo Dot	Need to research correct phrases or repeat or change request. Original volume to low. I did not learn on its own that Sirus Sixty on 6 moved to channel 73. Would not connect directly to the channel, had to make another choice another. My google device learned it. If it does not understand it automatically makes its own choice and just starts playing it without asking if I want this choice.	3	November 5, 2021	1

452	Echo Dot	I wanted a way to listen to music while my family and I cook and clean in kitchen. This product gets the job done, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the sound quality. It's supper muddy on the low end and doesn't have good dynamics at all. Especially when you turn the volume anywhere past the halfway point.Like I said, I don't need much and this gets the job done, but I just really wish it sounded better. It almost seems like I got a refurbished or used one that accidentally made it past quality control.I can't complain though because I got it as part of the 99¢ deal for being a first time amazon prime music subscriber. I would never pay full price for this device after hearing the sound quality.	2	February 8, 2022	0

454	Echo Dot	so i’ve had this for a few months and i’ve honestly loved the echo (bigger one) when i had one. i’ve never had any issues until i bought this one. it is a pain!! if i’m not home for a few days (i travel often) or even tonight, it has issues connecting to the internet. tonight, i was playing music and using it all day, but now when i asked alexa to set an alarm there were connectivity issues. i’ve called support and all they did was make me reset it, so i do it on my own. then i have to go in the app, delete it and reset it up. it’s honestly such an inconvenience and a drag. i can’t even just use it as a bluetooth speaker when this all happens so i’m forced to go through the whole process again. also consider, i have a roku 6~ ft away from the speaker that never struggles to connect to the internet as well as my laptop/phone, so i’m pretty annoyed and  i don’t even want to deal with it anymore.	3	July 21, 2020	1
455	Echo Dot	I don't honestly use alexa for much. I listen to pandora. It was a gift. Maybe if I took the effort to integrate my house, it could do more for me, but that isn't something I'm looking to do. It can't controll my smart TV. I can do stuff through my phone on alexa, but the things it can do are just easier on my phone than alexa. I have a Facebook portal (also a gift) that does similar things as alexa. Alexa does those things better, but I can't video call with alexa. I don't like how alexa will randomly think you called alexa while playing music or at other times. I don't like how commercials tell alexa to ask things, (like on pandora) and then alexa has to decide if alexa is going to do the things that came from the alexa speaker. The sound quality is pretty good. Not sure if it's better than the portal, though.	3	February 3, 2021	1

457	Echo Dot	With how popular these devices are, I’d expect them to be more simple to use. The device does not always play and must be frequently turned off and back on.

458	Echo Dot	"I use the 3 Echo Dots to stream music throughout my home.  The Alexa app is easy to download, install, and use on all my devices.  The Eco Dot is simple to set-up through the Alexa app.  I know there are a lot of smart-home, personal scheduling, and other ways to use the Echo Dots, but my home is dumb, my schedule is ""retired"", and I am enjoying streaming music.Two days after I wrote this, I have had trouble with one of the Echo Dots deciding to disconnect itself from the internet and the grouping.  Reading the ""help"" instructions and multiple attempts to reconnect have failed.  I am not sure what to do now, and I don't have a child or teenager to go to for tech advice.Last addition to this review, I promise!  The Echo Dots and Alexa have minds of their own!  One day, everything works well, and the next day I am uninstalling, re-installing, and re-configuring everything. When they work together with Alexa, they are fantastic for music streaming."	3	June 25, 2020	1

460	Echo Dot	I wasted a ridiculous amount of time trying to get my ECHO device connected to my 5g wifi internet. After some research, some online forums suggested splitting my 5g internet (to 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands) to try to get the ECHO to connected. That did not work either. What a waste of time and money. Amazon needs to provide an update to my ECHO device so that those of us with 5g can connect it. Now I just have a paper weight.	1	October 13, 2022	0
461	Echo Dot	I bought an Amazon Alexa less than 2 years ago, and have suddenly started having volume issues with it. The device will randomly reset itself to the second lowest volume setting. I will increase the volume, and it will stay increased for a while, but then will inevitably reset itself to volume level 2. This happens at least daily, sometimes multiple times a day.This started about 2 months ago. I tried factory resetting it, and when that didn't work I called Amazon expecting them to help me through this. They originally told me that this was a mass issue they were experiencing with my specific device, and that I would be added to their mass trouble ticket and given a call back to follow up. I never got a call back; three weeks later, I called to follow up.The second time I talked with Amazon, they said there was no mass ticket/issue, and they had no idea what I was talking about. Then they told me that because it was out of warranty I was SOL. The best they can do is offer me a 15% discount to buy another echo device....that I'm now sure will just break down as soon as it's out of warranty.This is the first time I've truly been disappointed in Amazon's customer service. There's no way I could be at fault for this issue; this is clearly a product issue (hardware or software, I'm not sure). But because of a policy shield, I'm screwed over. The rep even went so far as to say they couldn't be sure this type of issue wasn't my fault; how on earth could an issue like this be my fault?I expect these devices to last longer than a year and a half........ I'm extremely frustrated that Amazon is not standing by their own products, but instead is putting the customer on the hook for what is clearly a product malfunction.Buyer beware. This feels to me that Amazon knows its products will break down as soon as the warranty is up, screwing you over and banking (literally) on the assumption that you'll just continually buy new Alexa devices.	1	June 18, 2020	0

463	Echo Dot	"I honestly really like this little thing. I got it in white and it looks very nice. Sometimes (and I mean really not too often at all) she'll mishear something and I'm not too frustrated as I know it happens to others as well. I dont have any complaints about the audio quality but I also didn't purchase this to fill my whole entire house with music. It does fill up an entire room though and that's enough for me when I'm relaxing at home. I do have one complaint and it's the only reason I am giving 3 stars. I'm not sure if I received a faulty product but whenever I ""drop in"" with my boyfriend he'll be trying to talk to me and when I answer, he says he can barely hear me. This is so strange to me because I can hear him just fine and Alexa responds to me even when I'm across the room, but for me to be directly over the Alexa Dot and for him to tell me that with his volume all the way up he can still barely hear me tells me that maybe something's wrong with mine? I'm not sure exactly and it's really strange to me. Also slightly disappointed about that. Other than that, I really like this dot."	3	September 9, 2019	1

467	Echo Dot	I took advantage of Prime Day to order this Dot speaker for $19.99.  I figured it would be worth it to try out Alexa without the expense of a pricier 4th generation version, especially because reviews have been so poor for the more expensive 4th gen Echo.  I'm disappointed because my Mom's cylindrical Echo speaker (I bought it for her in May 2020 and think it may have been 2nd gen) has such clear sound.  So we do use this speaker when we want to listen to some music while doing household chores.  But I hope the next generation Echo speakers have better, more clear surround-sound quality and not the directional sound that's garnering so many poor reviews for the 4th-gen speakers.	3	July 4, 2021	1
468	Echo Dot	"For the $20 that I paid, it was a worthy purchase. Don't expect high quality sound, thumping base or adequate volume as you won't find it in the Dot 3rd Generation. It's adequate for use in a ""small"" bedroom, nothing larger."	3	December 28, 2021	1
469	Echo Dot	I bought two so I could do multi room music..  won't work. Bought ridiculously expensive lightbulbs.. won't  stay synced. Never can find them. What a waste. Overpriced alaem clocks.	2	August 13, 2022	0
470	Echo Dot	"I was excited, at my age, and looking forward to having a partial smart home.  I ordered the Echo Dot 3 gen (which I love even now) and two smart plugs to control two lamps...one in the bedroom and one by the front door.  The dot worked perfectly, plug it in and Alexa is ""in the house.""  The smart plugs would connect to the home network but no matter what we (Amazon Tech and myself) tried, the plugs would not react to the ""off/on"" commands.  The software would find the smart plug, install the drivers or whatever, but no reaction.  I was disappointed with the smart plugs only.  Please do not let my experience interfere with moving up a notch in the ""Smart Universe.""  This is probably an isolated incident and a possible something I overlooked in my network.  On top of it all, I lost my patience!  I wanted it to work out of the box.  I returned the entire package with reluctance.  Amazon is a great company for me.  I have never ever had to return anything before.  I personally realize there is no way back from the ""Smart Universe.""  By the way, the return was flawless."	3	October 28, 2019	1
471	Echo Dot	Just wish it had better mic quality to hear you and I wish it didn’t need a monthly sub	3	March 12, 2022	1
472	Echo Dot	The speaker and sound quality aren't the best but works fine. I guess has more bass so when volume up, I feel like the speaker going blow. However, this is not the case why I only gave 2 stars. The reasons, I gave 2 stars because it is not safe to use. What I mean is that, if you have kids or someone who doesn't listen will use this echo dot to order stuffs and subscribed (music, movie  and etc.) to any paid that Amazon offers therefore before you know you have charged for stuffs that you didn't purchased or subscribed. There's no way to control it and can always be reset by anyone using.My kids were playing with and asking (jokes, music, and etc.) questions. After a week, I noticed that they subscribed to Amazon music which I didn't allow or authorized to do so. I also noticed that, they reset the echo dot and even though it is not reset anyone can control over just by talking to the echo dot. This echo dot can order and check on your orders which no privacy. There's no way to control this device. If you buying this echo dot to use as speaker then it fine but remember anyone using this device can access to your Amazon information.	2	May 9, 2021	0
473	Echo Dot	"Being that the Echo Dot is just a tiny speaker, relatively speaking, I didn't expect much from this device. However, we have 5 Dots in the house now and two of the five have just been nearly useless when it comes to two-way communication (Drop in feature). Given that the major reason we purchased these were for the drop in function, it leaves a lot to be desired. Of course, the sound didn't start to go bad until after the ""support window"" had expired so we're stuck with a bad device. Thankfully they are cheap, but don't expect to get a whole lot for your money. I don't know if there are any good alternatives, but I'll be looking to buy something higher quality than the Dots. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone who wants decent sound quality."	3	June 6, 2021	1
474	Echo Dot	My new Echo dose not recognize other Alexa enabled devices that are already incorporated into my home Alexa system (Nest heating cooling system) and (Spotify).  Maybe I need to switch to Google products, I hear they are GREAT!	3	December 31, 2021	1
475	Echo Dot	This item came 'free' along with a small TV that I purchased. Our home & lifestyle are not geared for the features that the Echo Dot provide. So, will probably not use it.	3	January 20, 2022	1
476	Echo Dot	The device is fine I just did not realize you have to pay more for things. I got one for each of my kids and I can’t stream music at the same time	3	January 19, 2022	1
477	Echo Dot	I have two DOTS and I have thought about scaling back to one, because the one in the distant room often responds before the one that is only 6' away from me does. One is in my Master and one is in my Kitchen (35' apart with two walls separating them). These units do not communicate with each other nor do they apparently understand that both should not answer a request at nearly the same time.I am thinking about finding a way to set the sensitivity if it is available, but if not, I will have to shut one down. Not terribly impressed with the technology and I HATE the MUSIC Catalog. I have the paid subscription, but only get Live versions, or duets on many of my favorite songs and I HATE live Versions or Covers and have NO ABILITY to set preferences or verbally get it to stop these things. I thought it was cool at first, but it is wearing off quickly after a year of these limitations.	3	September 21, 2020	1
478	Echo Dot	My internet went out for 3 days this week, it really made me miss asking Alexa about the weather and hearing her answer something completely unrelated.	3	February 11, 2022	1
479	Echo Dot	"We bought the ""ball"" echo dot but despite buying a new router could not connect it. Amazon wanted to remote into my computer to assist, despite claims they'd never make such a request. We returned it and Amazon worked with us to get the ""hockey puck"" dot for a good price. It connected in about 30 seconds making me realize the first dot was defective. So far, we're still learning its positives & negatives. Sound leaves a lot to be desired but I can't complain too much for a $20 robot. Trying to get it to play specific episodes of podcasts is difficult and we're trying to learn how to speak to Alexis."	3	July 20, 2021	1
480	Echo Dot	The speaker started sounding muffled and busted after 2 weeks.	3	April 7, 2022	1
481	Echo Dot	Sound quality is better than expected and more than enough for my nightstand. It was a bit disappointing that Apple Podcasts and Apple Music can not be linked outside the USA.	3	January 30, 2022	1
482	Echo Dot	I bought this one to connect to my nest camera after researching that it can be connected. I was able to connect my Nest camera but realized that Alexa will not send alerts and notifications from Nest, which was a bummer. Otherwise this one does the job which it supposed to do.	3	December 7, 2021	1
483	Echo Dot	Very good as a smart device, but the lack or aux input and questionable sounds quality make it a lack luster device.	3	February 27, 2022	1
484	Echo Dot	This device was working just fine and now it's been about a year and I'm having issues, she is not speaking up with my reminders or timers.I understand it's 2018 version, but if it's only going to last a year don't bother selling it.Ugggggg	3	December 11, 2021	1
485	Echo Dot	this device is kind of lost on me. I don't really use it and as far as I know I have never played music on it. It seems to pick up sounds from the TV. One day I noticed a charge on my CC bill for $7.99 for Amazon Music, which surprised me since I didn't order it, have belonged to Prime for years, and usually listen to You Tube music videos anyway. But apparently Alexa deviously signed me up for a subscription I didn't even know I had. Luckily I check my bill. The same thing happened to a friend of mine.  This is a very devious way to line the pockets of Mr. Besos.  Imagine if they do that to every one who has one of these devices, and maybe 10% never even notice. Eight dollars a month times a million unknowing victims is a lot of money for nothing!	3	February 3, 2021	1
486	Echo Dot	They didn't have any Jamaican or Rasta voices	3	April 8, 2022	1
487	Echo Dot	I have newer Alexa's but I ordered this one because it was on sale and wanted one in my kitchen. This one lags like crazy. When I use the wake up word I have to wait a long time for the light to turn on so I know it is listening. Due to that lag sometimes it misses my command all together. I do not recommend this generation one.	2	June 8, 2022	0
488	Echo Dot	"Having issues with voice recognition. Purchased 2 additional sets of smart light bulbs that are Alexa compatible. Found that using numbers to dimlights works best. Example ; Alexa dim light to 25%. .... We currently have 2 Alexa units in use. Microphone is a probable issue for the voice issue but I'm still experimenting with placement as a remedy. Example; One unit is on the floor in the hallway. A possible solution to the problem may be mounting on a wall. Also there is an issue when 2 units are in use. I have a intermittent problem when say one unit is playing music and the other is off. When I say Alexa play music everywhere the second unit will change the station I was enjoying. Like and technology this thing is mostly good but still has some bugs. The Alexa guard feature is basically worthless. It will only detect breaking glass to send to an alert. I've had maintenance people and myself inside the home when the guard feature is activated..... no alerts. So don't get a false sense of security if you rely on this a a burglar alarm. Overall the Alexa is like a ""clapper"" on steroids. A clapper is a switch from long ago that when you clapped your hands lights would go on and off. So basically this echo thing is a lot more than that. To make lights and appliances work you must have a smart plug of light. Lights can be purchased for about 12$ each. The light feature is nice as Alexa can change the light color. Alexa does get a passing grade but still not going to be 100% with the current generation."	2	January 16, 2020	0
489	Echo Dot	This product is the worst.  It simply does not work.  I have to leave a review because it has absolutely driven me mad trying to link it, trying to get it to play my Apple music, trying to get it to do the simplest things that its own instruction book tells you it should do.  So tired of Alexa telling me I don't know how to do that when it is as simple request as to turn on the newly purchased Smart TV that came with the very Echo Dot, all of which was paired multiple times.  Then, there's the Apple music pairing issue where on some days it works and on others not so much.  Prepare yourself pls.  You will go crazy trying to pair it and to figure out why in the Alexa app it shows everything as paired but there is Alexa telling you that you still have to pair it.  Over and over again you will lose sanity trying to get it to simply play a song right in front of you.  No way to override the madness and to shove the damn song down Alexa's throat so she will spit it back out at you to inevitably play the one song right there on the app.  And then there is the issue of telling Alexa to play an album only to have her play one song from the album instead of the entire thing an what seems to be a concerted effort to only play Amazon music.My advice whether this Echo Dot was free or $100 or $20 - don't do it.  Don't buy it.  Save your sanity.  Save your precious time that will be invested in fixing all the problems that will arise and suck you in so you can get this DUMB PIECE OF EQUIPMENT to work correctly.Horrible piece of crap doesn't really do it justice.  If it was free to me, I'd take a hammer to it.  That, truly, would give me joy right after Alexa tells me she doesn't know how to do something she's done a million times over.  THE HAMMER AND A QUICK BURIAL WITH THE BROOM AND A TRASH CAN.  That only would bring peace to this generation of Echo Dot.	1	December 15, 2019	0
